# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0007662: response to triptolide - Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a triptolide stimulus. Triptolide is a  therapeutic diterpenoid derived from the Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii and has been shown to induce apoptosis by activation of pro-apoptotic proteins, inhibiting NFkB and c-KIT pathways, suppressing the Jak2 transcription, activating MAPK8/JNK signaling and modulating the heat shock responses.
GWAS_EFO_0006952: cytotoxicity measurement - quantification of some aspect of cytotoxity such as survival time or cell viability
GWAS_EFO_0007937: blood protein measurement - quantification of the levels of some protein in a blood sample
