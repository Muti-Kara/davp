# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0000305: breast carcinoma - A carcinoma that arises from epithelial cells of the breast
GWAS_EFO_1001132: pseudotumor cerebri - A condition marked by raised intracranial pressure and characterized clinically by HEADACHES; NAUSEA; PAPILLEDEMA, peripheral constriction of the visual fields, transient visual obscurations, and pulsatile TINNITUS. OBESITY is frequently associated with this condition, which primarily affects women between 20 and 44 years of age. Chronic PAPILLEDEMA may lead to optic nerve injury (see OPTIC NERVE DISEASES) and visual loss (see BLINDNESS).|Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a neurological disorder characterized by isolated increased intracranial pressure manifesting with recurrent and persistent headaches, nausea, vomiting, progressive and transient obstruction of the visual field, papilledema. Visual loss can be irreversible.
GWAS_EFO_0004278: sudden cardiac arrest - An unexpected natural death from a cardiac cause within a short time period from the onset of symptoms.|Unexpected rapid natural death due to cardiovascular collapse within one hour of initial symptoms. It is usually caused by the worsening of existing heart diseases. The sudden onset of symptoms, such as CHEST PAIN and CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS, particularly VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, can lead to the loss of consciousness and cardiac arrest followed by biological death. (from Braunwald's Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, 7th ed., 2005)|Change to current cardiac arrthymia parent requested and confirmed as a correct use of is-a by James Ware, cardiac expert.
GWAS_EFO_0005325: response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor - Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of an antiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.
