# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0006933: pallidum volume - quantification of the volume of the pallidum or globus pallidus, a sub-cortical structure of the brain that is part of the telencephalon
GWAS_EFO_0006931: nucleus accumbens volume - quantification of the volume of the nucleus accumbens, a region of the basal forebrain rostral to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus and which together with the olfactory tubercle forms the ventral striatum
GWAS_EFO_0007788: BMI-adjusted waist-hip ratio - waist-hip ratio that has been adjusted by subjects’ body mass index
GWAS_EFO_0004343: waist-hip ratio - The waist circumference measurement divided by the hip circumference measurement. For both men and women, a waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) of 1.0 or higher is considered "at risk" for undesirable health consequences, such as heart disease and ailments associated with OVERWEIGHT. A healthy WHR is 0.90 or less for men, and 0.80 or less for women. (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2004)
GWAS_EFO_0008579: risk-taking behaviour - The tendency to take risks. Risk-taking behaviour is a characteristic of several psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and bipolar disorder, as well as problem behaviours such as smoking and drug abuse.
GWAS_HP_0000539: Abnormality of refraction - An abnormality in the process of focusing of light by the eye in order to produce a sharp image on the retina.
GWAS_EFO_0004531: urate measurement - A urate measurement is the quantification of some urate in body fluid
GWAS_EFO_0004784: self reported educational attainment - A measure of educational progress reported using a questionnaire based approach, often used as a proxy for cognitive performance as the two are correlated.
GWAS_EFO_0008354: cognitive function measurement - quantification of some aspect of cognitive function
GWAS_EFO_0008394: verbal-numerical reasoning measurement - Quantification of verbal and/or numerical reasoning, typically based on a written or multiple choice test

GWAS_EFO_0006781: coffee consumption measurement - the quantification of some coffee consumption or coffee consumption-related behaviour, usually self-reported via a questionnaire
GWAS_EFO_0007878: alcohol consumption measurement - quantification of some aspect of alcohol consumption such as frequency or quantity
GWAS_EFO_0004319: smoking cessation - Discontinuation of the habit of smoking, the inhaling and exhaling of tobacco smoke.
GWAS_EFO_0005192: red blood cell distribution width - measure of the variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume
GWAS_EFO_0004908: testosterone measurement - is a quantification of testosterone, typically in serum. Testosterone is a steroid hormone.Testosterone measurement is used in the diagnosis ofprecocious or delayed puberty, infertility (in men and women), ovarian tumours, adrenal tumours and pituitary disorders.
GWAS_EFO_0006527: smoking status measurement - self-reported binary measure, used to denote whether an individual is currently or has ever been a smoker
GWAS_EFO_0005670: smoking initiation - initation of the habit of smoking, the inhaling and exhaling of tobacco smoke.
GWAS_EFO_0004875: mathematical ability - Is the mental process necessary to acquire knowledge or skill in the measurement, properties, and relationships of quantities and sets, using numbers and symbols (mathematics)
GWAS_EFO_0005677: puberty onset measurement - quantification of the onset of puberty in human males and females through a series of proxy measurements such as genital enlargement (males) or breast development (females). These characteristics are assessed based on pre-defined scales either through self-reporting or through assessment by a medical professional.
GWAS_EFO_0004581: interleukin 18 measurement - An IL-18 measurement is the quantification of IL-18, typically in blood.
