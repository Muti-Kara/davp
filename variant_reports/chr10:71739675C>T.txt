# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0004747: protein measurement - This is a general class for any measurement of a protein. Do not annotate to this class, request a more specific child term.|Is a quantification of some protein, typically obtained from an individual with the intention of using the measurement in some diagnostic process.
GWAS_EFO_0004363: information processing speed - time taken to analyse or transform input information in order to produce information as output
GWAS_EFO_0006829: GFR change measurement - A quantification of the variation in an individual's glomerular filtration rate (GFR) over a period of time used in assessment of kidney function and diagnosis of kidney disease.
GWAS_EFO_0003884: chronic kidney disease - Conditions in which the KIDNEYS perform below the normal level for more than three months. Chronic kidney insufficiency is classified by five stages according to the decline in GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE and the degree of kidney damage (as measured by the level of PROTEINURIA). The most severe form is the end-stage renal disease (CHRONIC KIDNEY FAILURE). (Kidney Foundation: Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative, 2002)|The end-stage of CHRONIC RENAL INSUFFICIENCY. It is characterized by the severe irreversible kidney damage (as measured by the level of PROTEINURIA) and the reduction in GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE to less than 15 ml per min (Kidney Foundation: Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative, 2002). These patients generally require HEMODIALYSIS or KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION.|Impairment of the renal function secondary to chronic kidney damage persisting for three or more months.
GWAS_EFO_0009179: beta-secretase 1 measurement - Quantification of the amount of beta-secretase 1 in a sample, typicallly cerebrospinal fluid. Beta-secretase-1 is an aspartic-acid protease important in the formation of myelin sheaths in peripheral nerve cells, and is thought to have a role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.
GWAS_EFO_0008579: risk-taking behaviour - The tendency to take risks. Risk-taking behaviour is a characteristic of several psychiatric disorders such as ADHD and bipolar disorder, as well as problem behaviours such as smoking and drug abuse.
GWAS_EFO_0004320: suicidal ideation - A risk factor for suicide attempts and completions, it is the most common of all suicidal behavior, but only a minority of ideators engage in overt self-harm.
GWAS_EFO_0007738: cingulate cortex measurement - quantification of some aspect of the cingulate cortex, a part of the brain situated in the medial aspect of the cerebral cortex
GWAS_EFO_0009392: glucose metabolism decline measurement - quantification of a reduction in glucose metabolism.
GWAS_EFO_1001929: selective IgA deficiency disease - A selective immunoglobulin deficiency disease that is the result of a deficiency of immunoglobulin A (IgA), an antibody that protects against infections of the mucous membranes lining the mouth, airways, and digestive tract.|A dysgammaglobulinemia characterized by low or undetectable serum levels of immunoglobulin class A (IgA). It is the most common primary antibody deficiency. It may be inherited or the reversible sequela of infection or certain drugs. It may be caused by decreased or inefficient class-switching from progenitor B cells without any corresponding decreases in the other isotypes. Though affected persons may be asymptomatic, low levels of IgA will reduce the immune system's ability to combat infection where IgA is normally secreted, at mucosal surfaces. Selective IgA deficiency is seen in greater proportion among patients with autoimmune disorders.
GWAS_EFO_0007858: eye morphology measurement - quantification of some aspect of eye morphology, such as the width of the eye socket
GWAS_EFO_0005782: age-related hearing impairment - Age-related hearing impairment is characterized by a symmetric sensorineural hearing loss that is most pronounced in the high frequencies. Age of onset, progression, and severity of age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) show great variation in the population, but with a demonstrable increased prevalence in males.|Editor note: check classification sensorineural vs conductive
GWAS_EFO_0000289: bipolar disorder - A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence.|A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence (MeSH).|A disorder of the brain that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. Often these moods range and shift from periods of elation and energized behavior to those of hopelessness and depression.
GWAS_EFO_0004340: body mass index - An indicator of body density as determined by the relationship of BODY WEIGHT to BODY HEIGHT. BMI=weight (kg)/height squared (m2). BMI correlates with body fat (ADIPOSE TISSUE). Their relationship varies with age and gender. For adults, BMI falls into these categories: below 18.5 (underweight); 18.5-24.9 (normal); 25.0-29.9 (overweight); 30.0 and above (obese). (National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
GWAS_EFO_0009369: diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide - A measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) transfer from inspired gas to pulmonary capillary blood. During the test, the subject inspires a gas containing CO and one or more tracer gases to allow determination of the gas exchanging capability of the lungs.
GWAS_EFO_0002690: systemic lupus erythematosus - An autoimmune multi-organ disease typically associated with vasculopathy and autoantibody production. Most patients have antinuclear antibodies (ANA). The presence of anti-dsDNA or anti-Smith antibodies are highly-specific.|A chronic, relapsing, inflammatory, and often febrile multisystemic disorder of connective tissue, characterized principally by involvement of the skin, joints, kidneys, and serosal membranes. It is of unknown etiology, but is thought to represent a failure of the regulatory mechanisms of the autoimmune system. The disease is marked by a wide range of system dysfunctions, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the formation of LE cells in the blood or bone marrow.
GWAS_EFO_0005192: red blood cell distribution width - measure of the variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume
GWAS_EFO_0007993: lymphocyte percentage of leukocytes - A calculated measurement in which the number of lymphocytes in a specified sample of blood is divided by the total number of white blood cells in the sample, and the result presented as a ratio, fraction, quotient or percentage. 
GWAS_EFO_0004308: leukocyte count - The number of WHITE BLOOD CELLS per unit volume in venous BLOOD. A differential leukocyte count measures the relative numbers of the different types of white cells.
GWAS_EFO_0004587: lymphocyte count - A quantification of lymphocytes in blood.
GWAS_EFO_0005091: monocyte count - quantification of monocytes in the blood
GWAS_EFO_0007990: neutrophil percentage of leukocytes - A calculated measurement in which the number of neutrophil granulocytes is divided by the number of all white blood cells in a specified sample of peripheral venous blood, and the result presented as a ratio, fraction, quotient or percentage. A neutrophil is, or is in the process of becoming, a granular leucocyte having a nucleus with three to five lobes connected by threads of chromatin, cytoplasm containing very fine granules, and which is readily stainable with neutral dyes.
GWAS_EFO_0007988: myeloid white cell count - The number of myeloid leukocytes in a specified volume of blood, usually 1 cubic millimeter.
GWAS_EFO_0004833: neutrophil count - Is a quantification of neutrophils in blood.|The number of granulocytes (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) in a specified volume of blood, usually 1 cubic millimeter.
