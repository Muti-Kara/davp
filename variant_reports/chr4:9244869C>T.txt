# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_GO_1901557: response to fenofibrate - Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a fenofibrate stimulus. Fenofibrates are a class of fibrate drugs which is mainly used to reduce cholesterol levels in patients at risk of cardiovascular disease. Like other fibrates, it reduces both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels, as well as increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and reducing triglycerides level. It is used alone or in conjunction with statins in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia.CHEBI:5001
GWAS_GO_1903491: response to simvastatin - "Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a simvastatin stimulus." [GO_REF:0000071, GOC:TermGenie, PMID:23100282]comment: Simvastatin is a statin  used as a cholesterol-lowering and anti-cardiovascular disease drug.
GWAS_EFO_0007681: triglyceride change measurement - quantification of the change in triglyceride levels in an individual over time, eg over the course of several hours after a high-fat meal 
GWAS_EFO_0001360: obsolete_type II diabetes mellitus - A subclass of DIABETES MELLITUS that is not INSULIN-responsive or dependent (NIDDM). It is characterized initially by INSULIN RESISTANCE and HYPERINSULINEMIA; and eventually by GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE; HYPERGLYCEMIA; and overt diabetes. Type II diabetes mellitus is no longer considered a disease exclusively found in adults. Patients seldom develop KETOSIS but often exhibit OBESITY.|A type of diabetes mellitus that is characterized by insulin resistance or desensitization and increased blood glucose levels. This is a chronic disease that can develop gradually over the life of a patient and can be linked to both environmental factors and heredity.
