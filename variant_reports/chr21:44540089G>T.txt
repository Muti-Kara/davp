# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0007825: balding measurement - quantification of the amount of balding in an individual
GWAS_Orphanet_79364: Alopecia - None
GWAS_EFO_0004505: telomere length - A measurement of telomere length measures the number of TTAGGG repeats at the end of the chromosome. As cell division proceeds telomeres shorten, telomere length is measure of cellular aging.
GWAS_EFO_0009183: empathy measurement - Quantification of some aspect of empathy, i.e. the ability to understand and share another person's experiences and emotions
GWAS_EFO_0009603: stroke outcome severity measurement - Quantification of the the degree of disability or dependence in the daily activities of people who have suffered a stroke, for example using the Modified Rankin Scale.
GWAS_HP_0002140: Ischemic stroke - Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is defined by the sudden loss of blood flow to an area of the brain with the resulting loss of neurologic function. It is caused by thrombosis or embolism that occludes a cerebral vessel supplying a specific area of the brain. During a vessel occlusion, there is a core area where damage to the brain is irreversible and an area of penumbra where the brain has lost function owing to decreased blood flow but is not irreversibly injured.
GWAS_Orphanet_278: Corticobasal degeneration - None
GWAS_EFO_0005301: reading and spelling ability - reading and spelling ability refers to the complex cognitive processes involved in assembling and decoding symbols in order to construct or derive words
