# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0005526: response to alcohol - physiological response of an organism, eg in terms of flushing, to consuming alcohol
GWAS_EFO_0004846: serotonin measurement - Is the quantification of circulating serotonin (5HT), a monoamine neurotransmitter
GWAS_EFO_0005192: red blood cell distribution width - measure of the variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume
GWAS_EFO_0007986: reticulocyte count - The number of reticulocytes per unit volume of blood. Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells and typically compose aoubt 1% of red blood cells in the human body.

GWAS_EFO_0010700: reticulocyte measurement - A quantification of some aspect of reticulocyte function, quantity, or composition.
GWAS_EFO_0004541: HbA1c measurement - A quantification of glycated A1c hemoglobin in blood used as an index for blood glucose level over several months.
GWAS_EFO_0004309: platelet count - The number of PLATELETS per unit volume in a sample of venous BLOOD.
GWAS_EFO_0004527: mean corpuscular hemoglobin - The MCH is  the average mass of hemoglobin per red blood cell in a sample of blood and is calculated by dividing the total mass of hemoglobin by the RBC count
GWAS_EFO_0004526: mean corpuscular volume - A mean corpuscular volume is the result of calculation of the mean volume of erythrocytes in a blood sample.
GWAS_EFO_0004584: mean platelet volume - A measurement of mean platelet volume is a machine-calculated measurement of the average size of platelets found in blood
GWAS_EFO_0004528: mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration - The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is a measure of the concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of packed red blood cell
GWAS_EFO_0007988: myeloid white cell count - The number of myeloid leukocytes in a specified volume of blood, usually 1 cubic millimeter.
GWAS_EFO_0004305: erythrocyte count - The number of red blood cells per unit volume in a sample of venous blood.
GWAS_EFO_0004833: neutrophil count - Is a quantification of neutrophils in blood.|The number of granulocytes (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) in a specified volume of blood, usually 1 cubic millimeter.
GWAS_EFO_0005664: blood metabolite measurement - quantification of some metabolite in blood
GWAS_EFO_0007978: red blood cell density measurement - quantification of the density of a red blood cell (DRBC). DRBC is affected by the hydration level of the cell, with dehydrated cells being dense and deformed. Increased DRBC may be an indicator of disease severity in sickle cell anemia
GWAS_EFO_0004509: hemoglobin measurement - hemoglobin levels|Hemoglobin measurement is a measure of the quantity of the metallo protein hemoglobin in blood often used in the diagnosis of anaemia.
GWAS_EFO_0010701: mean reticulocyte volume - Mean volume of reticulocyte cells
GWAS_EFO_0004308: leukocyte count - The number of WHITE BLOOD CELLS per unit volume in venous BLOOD. A differential leukocyte count measures the relative numbers of the different types of white cells.
GWAS_EFO_0005110: fatty acid measurement - The determination of the amount of fatty acids present in a sample.
GWAS_EFO_0006810: oleic acid measurement - The determination of the amount of oleic acid present in a sample.
GWAS_EFO_0004587: lymphocyte count - A quantification of lymphocytes in blood.
GWAS_EFO_0005091: monocyte count - quantification of monocytes in the blood
GWAS_EFO_1000478: Pituitary Gland Adenoma - A non-metastasizing tumor that arises from the adenohypophysial cells of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. The tumor can be hormonally functioning or not. The diagnosis can be based on imaging studies and/or radioimmunoassays. Due to its location in the sella turcica, expansion of the tumor mass can impinge on the optic chiasm or involve the temporal lobe, third ventricle and posterior fossa A frequently associated physical finding is bitemporal hemianopsia which may progress to further visual loss.
GWAS_EFO_0010091: tea consumption measurement - Quantification of some tea consumption or tea consumption-related behaviour, usually self-reported via a questionnaire.
GWAS_EFO_0009700: visual perception measurement - Quantification of some aspect of visual perception.
