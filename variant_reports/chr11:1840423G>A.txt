# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0000729: ulcerative colitis - Inflammation of the COLON that is predominantly confined to the MUCOSA. Its major symptoms include DIARRHEA, rectal BLEEDING, the passage of MUCUS, and ABDOMINAL PAIN.|An inflammatory bowel disease involving the mucosal surface of the large intestine and rectum. It may present with an acute or slow onset and follows an intermittent or continuous course. Signs and symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and intestinal hemorrhage.
GWAS_EFO_0003767: inflammatory bowel disease - A spectrum of small and large bowel inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology. It includes Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and colitis of indeterminate type.|A spectrum of small and large bowel inflammatory diseases of unknown etiology.  It includes Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and colitis of indeterminate type. --2003[accessedResource: NCIt:C3138][accessDate: 05-04-2011]
