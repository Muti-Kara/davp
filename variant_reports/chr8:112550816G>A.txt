# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0010476: dimethylglycine measurement - Quantification of dimethylglycine levels in a sample.
GWAS_EFO_0004265: peripheral arterial disease - A disorder of the arteries supplying the upper and lower extremity and the visceral organs. This includes the mesenteric arteries, the renal arteries and the aorta and excludes cerebrovascular arterial disease. Patients experience cramping and pain usually in the calves and thighs while walking. The symptoms subside with rest.|Lack of perfusion in the EXTREMITIES resulting from atherosclerosis. It is characterized by INTERMITTENT CLAUDICATION, and an ANKLE BRACHIAL INDEX of 0.9 or less.
GWAS_EFO_0004895: Tourette syndrome - A neuropsychological disorder related to alterations in DOPAMINE metabolism and neurotransmission involving frontal-subcortical neuronal circuits. Both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics need to be present with TICS occurring many times a day, nearly daily, over a period of more than one year. The onset is before age 18 and the disturbance is not due to direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. The disturbance causes marked distress or significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. (From DSM-IV, 1994; Neurol Clin 1997 May;15(2):357-79)|A neurologic disorder caused by defective metabolism of the neurotransmitters in the brain. It is characterized by repeated involuntary movements (motor tics) and uncontrollable vocal sounds (vocal tics). The symptoms are usually manifested before the age of eighteen.
GWAS_EFO_0010454: adenosine monophosphate measurement - Quantification of adenosine monophosphate levels in a sample.
GWAS_EFO_0005423: adolescent idiopathic scoliosis - A scoliosis with no known cause arising in adolescent.
GWAS_EFO_0007876: insomnia measurement - quantification of insomnia such as how often it occurs and its severity
GWAS_EFO_0000270: obsolete_asthma - A chronic respiratory disease manifested as difficulty breathing due to the narrowing of bronchial passageways.|Tendency of the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree to contract more intensely in response to a given stimulus than it does in the response seen in normal individuals. This condition is present in virtually all symptomatic patients with asthma. The most prominent manifestation of this smooth muscle contraction is a decrease in airway caliber that can be readily measured in the pulmonary function laboratory.|A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION. It is characterized by spasmodic contraction of airway smooth muscle, WHEEZING, and dyspnea (DYSPNEA, PAROXYSMAL).|A bronchial disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation and narrowing of the airways, which is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors resulting in recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound while breathing), chest tightness, shortness of breath, mucus production and coughing. The symptoms appear due to a variety of triggers such as allergens, irritants, respiratory infections, weather changes, excercise, stress, reflux disease, medications, foods and emotional anxiety.
GWAS_EFO_0004653: response to TNF antagonist - Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a TNF antagonist.
GWAS_EFO_0005413: joint damage measurement - quantification of the level of joint damage, eg through radiological analysis
GWAS_EFO_0000685: rheumatoid arthritis - Rheumatoid arthritis is a rheumatologic disorder described as an autoimmune disease that is usually a chronic disease and is characterized especially by pain, stiffness, inflammation, swelling, and sometimes destruction of joints.|A chronic, systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation in the synovial membranes and articular surfaces. It manifests primarily as a symmetric, erosive polyarthritis that spares the axial skeleton and is typically associated with the presence in the serum of rheumatoid factor.|A chronic systemic disease, primarily of the joints, marked by inflammatory changes in the synovial membranes and articular structures, widespread fibrinoid degeneration of the collagen fibers in mesenchymal tissues, and by atrophy and rarefaction of bony structures. Etiology is unknown, but autoimmune mechanisms have been implicated.|An arthritis that results_from an autoimmune disease which attacks healthy cells and tissue located_in joint.
