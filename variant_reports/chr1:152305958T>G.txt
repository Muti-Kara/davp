# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0004631: vitamin D measurement - A quantification of Vitamin D levels, typically in blood. Vitamin D includes both CHOLECALCIFEROLS and ERGOCALCIFEROLS, which have the common effect of preventing or curing RICKETS in animals. It can also be viewed as a hormone since it can be formed in SKIN by action of ULTRAVIOLET RAYS upon the precursors, 7-dehydrocholesterol and ERGOSTEROL, and acts on VITAMIN D RECEPTORS to regulate CALCIUM in opposition to PARATHYROID HORMONE (MeSH).25-hydroxyvitamin D or calcifediol, a prehormone precursor of vitamin D, is widely used as a proxy to quanitfy vitamin D levels in blood.|is about MeSH:D014807
GWAS_EFO_0004591: obsolete_childhood onset asthma - Asthma that starts in childhood.
GWAS_EFO_0010638: atopic asthma - An asthma that is characterized by symptoms that are triggered by an allergic reaction caused by inhaled allergens such as dust mite allergen, pet dander, pollen and mold.
GWAS_EFO_0000270: obsolete_asthma - A chronic respiratory disease manifested as difficulty breathing due to the narrowing of bronchial passageways.|Tendency of the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree to contract more intensely in response to a given stimulus than it does in the response seen in normal individuals. This condition is present in virtually all symptomatic patients with asthma. The most prominent manifestation of this smooth muscle contraction is a decrease in airway caliber that can be readily measured in the pulmonary function laboratory.|A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION. It is characterized by spasmodic contraction of airway smooth muscle, WHEEZING, and dyspnea (DYSPNEA, PAROXYSMAL).|A bronchial disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation and narrowing of the airways, which is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors resulting in recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound while breathing), chest tightness, shortness of breath, mucus production and coughing. The symptoms appear due to a variety of triggers such as allergens, irritants, respiratory infections, weather changes, excercise, stress, reflux disease, medications, foods and emotional anxiety.
GWAS_EFO_0004847: age at onset - The age at which some process, or disease started in a human individual.
GWAS_HP_0000964: Eczema - Eczema is a form of dermatitis. The term eczema is broadly applied to a range of persistent skin conditions and can be related to a number of underlying conditions. Manifestations of eczema can include dryness and recurring skin rashes with redness, skin edema, itching and dryness, crusting, flaking, blistering, cracking, oozing, or bleeding.|Eczema has several forms including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, dyshidrotic eczema, nummular eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, and stasis dermatitis.
GWAS_EFO_0003958: sunburn - An inflammatory reaction from ultraviolet radiation characterized by transient redness, tenderness and occasional blistering.|An injury to the skin causing erythema, tenderness, and sometimes blistering and resulting from excessive exposure to the sun. The reaction is produced by the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight.
GWAS_EFO_0003785: obsolete_allergy - An immune system disease that is an exaggerated immune response to allergens, such as insect venom, dust mites, pollen, pet dander, drugs or some foods.|Allergy is any exaggerated immune response to a foreign antigen regardless of mechanism. Thus it includes atopy.Source: Merck Manual|Altered reactivity to an antigen, which can result in pathologic reactions upon subsequent exposure to that particular antigen.
GWAS_EFO_0000684: respiratory system disease - A body system disease that occurs in different organs functioning in respiration and consisting especially of the nose, nasal passages, nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs.|A non-neoplastic or neoplastic disorder that affects the respiratory system. Representative examples include pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary failure, lung adenoma, lung carcinoma, and tracheal carcinoma.
GWAS_EFO_0000676: psoriasis - An autoimmune condition characterized by red, well-delineated plaques with silvery scales that are usually on the extensor surfaces and scalp. They can occasionally present with these manifestations: pustules; erythema and scaling in intertriginous areas, and erythroderma, that are often distributed on extensor surfaces and scalp.|A common genetically determined, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by rounded erythematous, dry, scaling patches. The lesions have a predilection for nails, scalp, genitalia, extensor surfaces, and the lumbosacral region. Accelerated epidermopoiesis is considered to be the fundamental pathologic feature in psoriasis.
GWAS_EFO_0000274: atopic eczema - A chronic inflammatory genetically determined disease of the skin marked by increased ability to form reagin (IgE), with increased susceptibility to allergic rhinitis and asthma, and hereditary disposition to a lowered threshold for pruritus. It is manifested by lichenification, excoriation, and crusting, mainly on the flexural surfaces of the elbow and knee. In infants it is known as infantile eczema.
GWAS_EFO_0009942: Glucocorticoid use measurement - Quantification of some aspect of the use of glucocorticoids.
GWAS_EFO_0009941: Inhalant adrenergic use measurement - Quantification of some aspect of the use of inhalant adrenergic drugs.
GWAS_EFO_0008378: mosquito bite reaction size measurement - quantification of the size of a mosquito bite reaction, generally through the use of a standardised questionnaire
GWAS_EFO_0008377: mosquito bite reaction itch intensity measurement - quanitifcation of the itch intensity of a mosquito bite reaction, generally through the use of a standardised questionnaire
GWAS_EFO_0008406: susceptibility to plantar warts measurement - Quantification of an individual's susceptibility to plantar warts
GWAS_EFO_0000756: melanoma - A malignant, usually aggressive tumor composed of atypical, neoplastic melanocytes. Most often, melanomas arise in the skin (cutaneous melanomas) and include the following histologic subtypes: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, and lentigo maligna melanoma. Cutaneous melanomas may arise from acquired or congenital melanocytic or dysplastic nevi. Melanomas may also arise in other anatomic sites including the gastrointestinal system, eye, urinary tract, and reproductive system. Melanomas frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and brain.
GWAS_EFO_0005854: allergic rhinitis - Inflammation of the nasal mucous membranes caused by an IgE-mediated response to external allergens. The inflammation may also involve the mucous membranes of the sinuses, eyes, middle ear, and pharynx. Symptoms include sneezing, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and itching. It may lead to fatigue, drowsiness, and malaise thus causing impairment of the quality of life.
GWAS_EFO_0004365: personality trait - The characteristics in behavior that a certain person has.
GWAS_EFO_0005203: eating disorder - A broad group of psychological disorders with abnormal eating behaviors leading to physiological effects from overeating or insufficient food intake.|A group of disorders characterized by physiological and psychological disturbances in appetite or food intake.
GWAS_EFO_0000717: systemic scleroderma - A chronic disorder, possibly autoimmune, marked by excessive production of collagen which results in hardening and thickening of body tissues. The two types of systemic scleroderma, limited cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous are classified with focus on the extent of affected skin. A relationship exists between the extent of skin area affected and degree of internal organ/system involvement. Systemic scleroderma can manifest itself in pulmonary fibrosis, Raynaud's syndrome, digestive system telangiectasias, renal hypertension and/or pulmonary hypertension.|A scleroderma that is characterized by fibrosis (or hardening) of the skin and major organs, as well as vascular alterations, and autoantibodies.|A chronic multi-system disorder of CONNECTIVE TISSUE. It is characterized by SCLEROSIS in the SKIN, the LUNGS, the HEART, the GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, the KIDNEYS, and the MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM. Other important features include diseased small BLOOD VESSELS and AUTOANTIBODIES. The disorder is named for its most prominent feature (hard skin), and classified into subsets by the extent of skin thickening: LIMITED SCLERODERMA and DIFFUSE SCLERODERMA.
