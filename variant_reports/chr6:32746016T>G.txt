The inflammation may also involve the mucous membranes of the sinuses, eyes, middle ear, and pharynx. Symptoms include sneezing, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and itching. It may lead to fatigue, drowsiness, and malaise thus causing impairment of the quality of life.
GWAS_HP_0000964: Eczema - Eczema is a form of dermatitis. The term eczema is broadly applied to a range of persistent skin conditions and can be related to a number of underlying conditions. Manifestations of eczema can include dryness and recurring skin rashes with redness, skin edema, itching and dryness, crusting, flaking, blistering, cracking, oozing, or bleeding.|Eczema has several forms including atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, dyshidrotic eczema, nummular eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, and stasis dermatitis.
GWAS_EFO_0000389: cutaneous melanoma - A primary melanoma arising from atypical melanocytes in the skin. Precursor lesions include acquired and congenital melanocytic nevi, and dysplastic nevi. Several histologic variants have been recognized, including superficial spreading melanoma, acral lentiginous melanoma, nodular melanoma, and lentigo maligna melanoma.
GWAS_EFO_0008401: susceptibility to shingles measurement - Quantification of an individual's susceptibility to shingles, a pinaful rash resultin from reactivation of latent Varicella zoster virus infection within a dorsal root ganglion, typically occuring in later life.
