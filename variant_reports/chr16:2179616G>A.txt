# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0007789: BMI-adjusted waist circumference - waist circumference measurement that has been adjusted by subjects’ body mass index
GWAS_EFO_0004339: body height - The distance from the sole to the crown of the head with body standing on a flat surface and fully extended.
GWAS_EFO_0006335: systolic blood pressure - The blood pressure during the contraction of the left ventricle of the heart.
GWAS_EFO_0005763: pulse pressure measurement - quantification of the difference between systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure. Higher PP is associated with left ventricle hypertrophy and the increased intimal thickness of the carotid artery, which represent early target organ damage in cardiovascular diseases
GWAS_EFO_0006336: diastolic blood pressure - The blood pressure after the contraction of the heart while the chambers of the heart refill with blood.
