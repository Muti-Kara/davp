GWAS_EFO_0007041: obese body mass index status - quantification of weight/height relationships above a certain threshold that classes an individual as overweight. This threshold may vary based on an individual's ethnicity but is commonly considered to correspond in European populations to a BMI > 30.

GWAS_EFO_0004339: body height - The distance from the sole to the crown of the head with body standing on a flat surface and fully extended.

It is usually caused by the worsening of existing heart diseases. The sudden onset of symptoms, such as CHEST PAIN and CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS, particularly VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA, can lead to the loss of consciousness and cardiac arrest followed by biological death.
