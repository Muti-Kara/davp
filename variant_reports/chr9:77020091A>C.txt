# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_HP_0002014: Diarrhea - Abnormally increased frequency of loose or watery bowel movements.
GWAS_EFO_0001645: coronary artery disease - Thickening and loss of elasticity of the CORONARY ARTERIES, leading to progressive arterial insufficiency (CORONARY DISEASE).|Narrowing of the coronary arteries due to fatty deposits inside the arterial walls. The diagnostic criteria may include documented history of any of the following: documented coronary artery stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (by cardiac catheterization or other modality of direct imaging of the coronary arteries); previous coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG); previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); previous myocardial infarction. (ACC)|Pathological processes of CORONARY ARTERIES that may derive from a congenital abnormality, atherosclerotic, or non-atherosclerotic cause.|Narrowing of the coronary arteries due to fatty deposits inside the arterial walls.|An imbalance between myocardial functional requirements and the capacity of the CORONARY VESSELS to supply sufficient blood flow. It is a form of MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA (insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle) caused by a decreased capacity of the coronary vessels.
GWAS_EFO_0005672: acute coronary syndrome - A disorder characterized by signs and symptoms related to acute ischemia of the myocardium secondary to coronary artery disease. The clinical presentation covers a spectrum of heart diseases from unstable angina to myocardial infarction.|Signs and symptoms related to acute ischemia of the myocardium secondary to coronary artery disease. The clinical presentation covers a spectrum of heart diseases from unstable angina to myocardial infarction.
GWAS_EFO_0008395: response to darapladib - Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of darapladib stimulus. Darapladib is a  lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 inhibitor, developed for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
GWAS_EFO_0000195: metabolic syndrome - A cluster of metabolic risk factors for CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES and TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. The major components of metabolic syndrome X include excess ABDOMINAL FAT; atherogenic DYSLIPIDEMIA; HYPERTENSION; HYPERGLYCEMIA; INSULIN RESISTANCE; a proinflammatory state; and a prothrombotic (THROMBOSIS) state. (from AHA/NHLBI/ADA Conference Proceedings, Circulation 2004; 109:551-556)|A combination of medical conditions that, when present, increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes mellitus. It includes the following medical conditions: increased blood pressure, central obesity, abnormal cholesterol levels, and elevated fasting glucose.|Reason: duplicate. This will be merged with MONDO:0000816
GWAS_EFO_0004570: bilirubin measurement - A bilirubin measurement is a quantification of bilirubin typically measured in serum.
