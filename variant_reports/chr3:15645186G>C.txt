# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0001645: coronary artery disease - Thickening and loss of elasticity of the CORONARY ARTERIES, leading to progressive arterial insufficiency (CORONARY DISEASE).|Narrowing of the coronary arteries due to fatty deposits inside the arterial walls. The diagnostic criteria may include documented history of any of the following: documented coronary artery stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (by cardiac catheterization or other modality of direct imaging of the coronary arteries); previous coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG); previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); previous myocardial infarction. (ACC)|Pathological processes of CORONARY ARTERIES that may derive from a congenital abnormality, atherosclerotic, or non-atherosclerotic cause.|Narrowing of the coronary arteries due to fatty deposits inside the arterial walls.|An imbalance between myocardial functional requirements and the capacity of the CORONARY VESSELS to supply sufficient blood flow. It is a form of MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA (insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle) caused by a decreased capacity of the coronary vessels.
GWAS_EFO_0000676: psoriasis - An autoimmune condition characterized by red, well-delineated plaques with silvery scales that are usually on the extensor surfaces and scalp. They can occasionally present with these manifestations: pustules; erythema and scaling in intertriginous areas, and erythroderma, that are often distributed on extensor surfaces and scalp.|A common genetically determined, chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by rounded erythematous, dry, scaling patches. The lesions have a predilection for nails, scalp, genitalia, extensor surfaces, and the lumbosacral region. Accelerated epidermopoiesis is considered to be the fundamental pathologic feature in psoriasis.
GWAS_HP_0002014: Diarrhea - Abnormally increased frequency of loose or watery bowel movements.
GWAS_EFO_0005672: acute coronary syndrome - A disorder characterized by signs and symptoms related to acute ischemia of the myocardium secondary to coronary artery disease. The clinical presentation covers a spectrum of heart diseases from unstable angina to myocardial infarction.|Signs and symptoms related to acute ischemia of the myocardium secondary to coronary artery disease. The clinical presentation covers a spectrum of heart diseases from unstable angina to myocardial infarction.
GWAS_EFO_0008395: response to darapladib - Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of darapladib stimulus. Darapladib is a  lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 inhibitor, developed for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.
GWAS_EFO_0004530: triglyceride measurement - A triglyceride  measurement is a quantification of triglycerides in some body fluid, used as a biomarker for cardiovascular disease.
GWAS_EFO_0009959: diverticular disease - A complex disorder characterised by mucosal outpouchings (diverticulae) of the colonic wall which can become infected and inflamed leading to diverticulitis, perforation and bleeding.
GWAS_EFO_0004327: electrocardiography - Recording of the moment-to-moment electromotive forces of theÂ HEARTÂ as projected onto various sites on the body's surface, delineated as a scalar function of time. The recording is monitored by a tracing on slow moving chart paper or by observing it on a cardioscope, which is aÂ CATHODE RAY TUBE DISPLAY.
GWAS_EFO_0004343: waist-hip ratio - The waist circumference measurement divided by the hip circumference measurement. For both men and women, a waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) of 1.0 or higher is considered "at risk" for undesirable health consequences, such as heart disease and ailments associated with OVERWEIGHT. A healthy WHR is 0.90 or less for men, and 0.80 or less for women. (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2004)
GWAS_EFO_0004584: mean platelet volume - A measurement of mean platelet volume is a machine-calculated measurement of the average size of platelets found in blood
GWAS_EFO_0001360: obsolete_type II diabetes mellitus - A subclass of DIABETES MELLITUS that is not INSULIN-responsive or dependent (NIDDM). It is characterized initially by INSULIN RESISTANCE and HYPERINSULINEMIA; and eventually by GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE; HYPERGLYCEMIA; and overt diabetes. Type II diabetes mellitus is no longer considered a disease exclusively found in adults. Patients seldom develop KETOSIS but often exhibit OBESITY.|A type of diabetes mellitus that is characterized by insulin resistance or desensitization and increased blood glucose levels. This is a chronic disease that can develop gradually over the life of a patient and can be linked to both environmental factors and heredity.
GWAS_EFO_0004309: platelet count - The number of PLATELETS per unit volume in a sample of venous BLOOD.
GWAS_EFO_0004340: body mass index - An indicator of body density as determined by the relationship of BODY WEIGHT to BODY HEIGHT. BMI=weight (kg)/height squared (m2). BMI correlates with body fat (ADIPOSE TISSUE). Their relationship varies with age and gender. For adults, BMI falls into these categories: below 18.5 (underweight); 18.5-24.9 (normal); 25.0-29.9 (overweight); 30.0 and above (obese).
