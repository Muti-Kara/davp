# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0010701: mean reticulocyte volume - Mean volume of reticulocyte cells
GWAS_EFO_0004526: mean corpuscular volume - A mean corpuscular volume is the result of calculation of the mean volume of erythrocytes in a blood sample.
GWAS_EFO_0004348: hematocrit - The volume of packed RED BLOOD CELLS in a blood specimen. The volume is measured by centrifugation in a tube with graduated markings, or with automated blood cell counters. It is an indicator of erythrocyte status in disease. For example, ANEMIA shows a low value; POLYCYTHEMIA, a high value.
GWAS_EFO_0004509: hemoglobin measurement - hemoglobin levels|Hemoglobin measurement is a measure of the quantity of the metallo protein hemoglobin in blood often used in the diagnosis of anaemia.
GWAS_EFO_0005192: red blood cell distribution width - measure of the variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume
GWAS_EFO_0004528: mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration - The mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is a measure of the concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of packed red blood cell
GWAS_EFO_0004527: mean corpuscular hemoglobin - The MCH is  the average mass of hemoglobin per red blood cell in a sample of blood and is calculated by dividing the total mass of hemoglobin by the RBC count
GWAS_EFO_0007986: reticulocyte count - The number of reticulocytes per unit volume of blood. Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells and typically compose aoubt 1% of red blood cells in the human body.
GWAS_EFO_0010700: reticulocyte measurement - A quantification of some aspect of reticulocyte function, quantity, or composition.
GWAS_EFO_0009270: heel bone mineral density - Quantification of the mineral density of the heel bone
GWAS_EFO_0001360: obsolete_type II diabetes mellitus - A subclass of DIABETES MELLITUS that is not INSULIN-responsive or dependent (NIDDM). It is characterized initially by INSULIN RESISTANCE and HYPERINSULINEMIA; and eventually by GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE; HYPERGLYCEMIA; and overt diabetes. Type II diabetes mellitus is no longer considered a disease exclusively found in adults. Patients seldom develop KETOSIS but often exhibit OBESITY.|A type of diabetes mellitus that is characterized by insulin resistance or desensitization and increased blood glucose levels. This is a chronic disease that can develop gradually over the life of a patient and can be linked to both environmental factors and heredity.
GWAS_EFO_0004627: IGF-1 measurement - Is the quantification of Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), also called somatomedin C. IGF-1 is a hormone similar in molecular structure to insulin. It plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have anabolic effects in adults. Levels of IGF-1 are known to increase in some cancers.
GWAS_EFO_0004458: C-reactive protein measurement - C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement is a measurement of the level of C-reactive protein in the blood.  Levels are known to rise in response to inflammation, CRP is therefore used as a clinical measure of inflammation. The measurement is used in the process of clinical diagnosis as high levels of CRP are associated with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension and in some cancers.|is about MeSH:D002097
GWAS_EFO_0010417: triacylglycerol 52:5 measurement - The quantification of triacylglycerol 52:5 levels in some body fluid, used as a biomarker for disease.
GWAS_EFO_0001663: prostate carcinoma - A carcinoma that arises from epithelial cells of the prostate gland.
GWAS_EFO_0006335: systolic blood pressure - The blood pressure during the contraction of the left ventricle of the heart.
GWAS_EFO_0000692: obsolete_schizophrenia - A major psychotic disorder characterized by abnormalities in the perception or expression of reality. It affects the cognitive and psychomotor functions. Common clinical signs and symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and retreat from reality.|A severe emotional disorder of psychotic depth characteristically marked by a retreat from reality with delusion formation, HALLUCINATIONS, emotional disharmony, and regressive behavior.
GWAS_EFO_0004567: antipsychotic drug related weight gain - The process of increasing body mass during treatment with an antipsychotic drug. http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=173781
GWAS_EFO_0007843: nose morphology measurement - quantification of some aspect of nose morphology such as nose wing breadth, nose tip shape or nose profile
