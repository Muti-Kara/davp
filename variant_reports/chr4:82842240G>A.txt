# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0000270: obsolete_asthma - A chronic respiratory disease manifested as difficulty breathing due to the narrowing of bronchial passageways.|Tendency of the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree to contract more intensely in response to a given stimulus than it does in the response seen in normal individuals. This condition is present in virtually all symptomatic patients with asthma. The most prominent manifestation of this smooth muscle contraction is a decrease in airway caliber that can be readily measured in the pulmonary function laboratory.|A form of bronchial disorder with three distinct components: airway hyper-responsiveness (RESPIRATORY HYPERSENSITIVITY), airway INFLAMMATION, and intermittent AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION. It is characterized by spasmodic contraction of airway smooth muscle, WHEEZING, and dyspnea (DYSPNEA, PAROXYSMAL).|A bronchial disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation and narrowing of the airways, which is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors resulting in recurring periods of wheezing (a whistling sound while breathing), chest tightness, shortness of breath, mucus production and coughing. The symptoms appear due to a variety of triggers such as allergens, irritants, respiratory infections, weather changes, excercise, stress, reflux disease, medications, foods and emotional anxiety.
GWAS_EFO_0007990: neutrophil percentage of leukocytes - A calculated measurement in which the number of neutrophil granulocytes is divided by the number of all white blood cells in a specified sample of peripheral venous blood, and the result presented as a ratio, fraction, quotient or percentage. A neutrophil is, or is in the process of becoming, a granular leucocyte having a nucleus with three to five lobes connected by threads of chromatin, cytoplasm containing very fine granules, and which is readily stainable with neutral dyes.
GWAS_EFO_0004842: eosinophil count - Is a quantification of eosinphils in blood.|The number of granulocytes (polymorphonuclear leukocytes) in a specified volume of blood, usually 1 cubic millimeter.
