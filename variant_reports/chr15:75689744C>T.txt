# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0004305: erythrocyte count - The number of red blood cells per unit volume in a sample of venous blood.
GWAS_GO_1903491: response to simvastatin - "Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a simvastatin stimulus." [GO_REF:0000071, GOC:TermGenie, PMID:23100282]comment: Simvastatin is a statin  used as a cholesterol-lowering and anti-cardiovascular disease drug.
GWAS_EFO_0004145: myopathy - A disease of the muscle in which the muscle fibers do not function properly. This results in muscular weakness.|A muscular disease in which the muscle fibers do not function resulting in muscular weakness.|Editor note: TODO check this, relationship to myotonic disorder/syndrome, also check HP definition
