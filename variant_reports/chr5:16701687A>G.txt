# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_GO_0036276: response to antidepressant - Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of an antidepressant stimulus, a mood-stimulating drug.
GWAS_EFO_0004747: protein measurement - This is a general class for any measurement of a protein. Do not annotate to this class, request a more specific child term.|Is a quantification of some protein, typically obtained from an individual with the intention of using the measurement in some diagnostic process.
GWAS_EFO_0005110: fatty acid measurement - The determination of the amount of fatty acids present in a sample.
GWAS_EFO_0009751: facial asymmetry measurement - Quantification of assymetry of the face.
GWAS_EFO_0003761: unipolar depression - A mood disorder having a clinical course involving one or more episodes of serious psychological depression that last two or more weeks each, do not have intervening episodes of mania or hypomania, and are characterized by a loss of interest or pleasure in almost all activities and by some or all of disturbances of appetite, sleep, or psychomotor functioning, a decrease in energy, difficulties in thinking or making decisions, loss of self-esteem or feelings of guilt, and suicidal thoughts or attempts.
GWAS_EFO_0004703: age at menarche - The age of onset of (human) menarche, the beginning of the first menstrual cycle in an individual
GWAS_EFO_0010504: inositol measurement - Quantification of inositol levels in a sample.
GWAS_EFO_0009855: frontal fibrosing alopecia - A lichenoid and scarring inflammatory skin disorder associated with widespread cutaneous inflammation and irreversible hair loss, which occurs predominantly in women of post-menopausal age.
GWAS_EFO_0000341: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - A group of disorders affecting the bronchi and the lung parenchyma. It is characterized by chronic and irreversible obstruction of the airflow. It includes chronic bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema.|A disease of chronic diffuse irreversible airflow obstruction. Subcategories of COPD include CHRONIC BRONCHITIS and PULMONARY EMPHYSEMA.|A chronic and progressive lung disorder characterized by the loss of elasticity of the bronchial tree and the air sacs, destruction of the air sacs wall, thickening of the bronchial wall, and mucous accumulation in the bronchial tree. The pathologic changes result in the disruption of the air flow in the bronchial airways. Signs and symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, productive cough, and chest tightness. The two main types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphysema.
GWAS_EFO_0001071: lung carcinoma - A carcinoma that arises from epithelial cells of the lung
GWAS_EFO_0005937: longitudinal BMI measurement - quantification of the variation in body mass index over time
GWAS_HP_0002916: Abnormality of chromosome segregation - An abnormality of chromosome segregation.
GWAS_EFO_0005118: IGFBP-1 measurement - IGF-binding proteins prolong the half-life of the IGFs and have been shown to either inhibit or stimulate the growth promoting effects of the IGFs on cell culture. They alter the interaction of IGFs with their cell surface receptors. Promotes cell migration.
GWAS_EFO_0009270: heel bone mineral density - Quantification of the mineral density of the heel bone
