# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0004318: smoking behavior - Inhaling and exhaling the smoke of tobacco or something similar to tobacco.
GWAS_EFO_0004340: body mass index - An indicator of body density as determined by the relationship of BODY WEIGHT to BODY HEIGHT. BMI=weight (kg)/height squared (m2). BMI correlates with body fat (ADIPOSE TISSUE). Their relationship varies with age and gender. For adults, BMI falls into these categories: below 18.5 (underweight); 18.5-24.9 (normal); 25.0-29.9 (overweight); 30.0 and above (obese). (National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
GWAS_EFO_0007788: BMI-adjusted waist-hip ratio - waist-hip ratio that has been adjusted by subjects’ body mass index
GWAS_EFO_0005208: glomerular filtration rate - measurement of the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney, calculated either by comparative measurements of substances in the blood and urine, or estimated from a blood test
GWAS_EFO_0004735: serum alanine aminotransferase measurement - Is a quantification of serum alanine aminotransferase, most commonly found in liver, the test is used in ascertainment of liver function.
GWAS_EFO_0006525: cigarettes per day measurement - the quantification of the number of cigarettes that a subject smoked on average per day
GWAS_EFO_0006336: diastolic blood pressure - The blood pressure after the contraction of the heart while the chambers of the heart refill with blood.
GWAS_GO_0097366: response to bronchodilator - Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus with a bronchodilator agent. (CHEBI:35523 bronchodilator agent)
GWAS_EFO_0004713: FEV/FEC ratio - None
GWAS_EFO_0004314: forced expiratory volume - Measure of the maximum amount of air that can be expelled in a given number of seconds during aÂ FORCED VITAL CAPACITYÂ determination . It is usually given asÂ FEVÂ followed by a subscript indicating the number of seconds over which the measurement is made, although it is sometimes given as a percentage of forced vital capacity.
GWAS_EFO_0000571: lung adenocarcinoma - A carcinoma that arises from the lung and is characterized by the presence of malignant glandular epithelial cells. There is a male predilection with a male to female ratio of 2:1. Usually lung adenocarcinoma is asymptomatic and is identified through screening studies or as an incidental radiologic finding. If clinical symptoms are present they include shortness of breath, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and fever. Tobacco smoke is a known risk factor.
GWAS_EFO_0001071: lung carcinoma - A carcinoma that arises from epithelial cells of the lung
GWAS_EFO_0006527: smoking status measurement - self-reported binary measure, used to denote whether an individual is currently or has ever been a smoker
GWAS_EFO_0001645: coronary artery disease - Thickening and loss of elasticity of the CORONARY ARTERIES, leading to progressive arterial insufficiency (CORONARY DISEASE).|Narrowing of the coronary arteries due to fatty deposits inside the arterial walls. The diagnostic criteria may include documented history of any of the following: documented coronary artery stenosis greater than or equal to 50% (by cardiac catheterization or other modality of direct imaging of the coronary arteries); previous coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG); previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); previous myocardial infarction. (ACC)|Pathological processes of CORONARY ARTERIES that may derive from a congenital abnormality, atherosclerotic, or non-atherosclerotic cause.|Narrowing of the coronary arteries due to fatty deposits inside the arterial walls.|An imbalance between myocardial functional requirements and the capacity of the CORONARY VESSELS to supply sufficient blood flow. It is a form of MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA (insufficient blood supply to the heart muscle) caused by a decreased capacity of the coronary vessels.
GWAS_EFO_0004723: coronary artery calcification - Calcification of the coronary artery, used as a measure of coronary atherosclerosis, a risk factor for myocardial infarction.
GWAS_EFO_0004345: corneal topography - The measurement of curvature and shape of the anterior surface of the cornea using techniques such as keratometry, keratoscopy, photokeratoscopy, profile photography, computer-assisted image processing and videokeratography. This measurement is often applied in the fitting of contact lenses and in diagnosing corneal diseases or corneal changes including keratoconus, which occur after keratotomy and keratoplasty.
GWAS_EFO_0004541: HbA1c measurement - A quantification of glycated A1c hemoglobin in blood used as an index for blood glucose level over several months.
