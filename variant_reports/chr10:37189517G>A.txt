The clinical signs can range from hypothyroidism to thyrotoxicosis depending on the type of autoimmune thyroiditis.|a disease in which the body interprets the thyroid glands and its hormone products T3, T4 and TSH as threats, therefore producing special antibodies that target the thyroid’s cells, thereby destroying it.It presents with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and the presence or absence of goiters.|Disease of the thyroid gland due to autoimmunity in which the patient's immune system attacks and damages their thyroid. It can be either hyper- or hypothyroidism. (http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24314 - accessed 20th July, 2015)

Epithelioid GRANULOMAS may be seen in some patients.|A gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic inflammation involving all layers of the intestinal wall, noncaseating granulomas affecting the intestinal wall and regional lymph nodes, and transmural fibrosis. Crohn disease most commonly involves the terminal ileum; the colon is the second most common site of involvement.

It has_symptom abdominal pain, has_symptom constipation, has_symptom diarrhea, has_symptom nausea and vomiting, and has_symptom loss of appetite.|An autoimmune genetic disorder with an unknown pattern of inheritance that primarily affects the digestive tract. It is caused by intolerance to dietary gluten. Consumption of gluten protein triggers an immune response which damages small intestinal villi and prevents adequate absorption of nutrients. Clinical signs include abdominal cramping, diarrhea or constipation and weight loss. If untreated, the clinical course may progress to malnutrition, anemia, osteoporosis and an increased risk of intestinal malignancies.

GWAS_EFO_0002609: juvenile idiopathic arthritis - Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), is the most common form of arthritis in children and adolescents. (Juvenile in this context refers to an onset before age 16, idiopathic refers to a condition with no defined cause, and arthritis is the inflammation of the synovium of a joint.) JIA is an autoimmune, non-infective, inflammatory joint disease of more than 6 weeks duration in children less than 16 years of age. The disease commonly occurs in children from the ages of 7 to 12, but it may occur in adolescents as old as 15 years of age, as well as in infants. It is a subset of arthritis seen in childhood, which may be transient and self-limited or chronic. It differs significantly from arthritis commonly seen in adults (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis), and other types of arthritis that can present in childhood which are chronic conditions (e.g. psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis). Aetiopathology is similar to rheumatoid arthritis but with less marked cartilage erosion, and joint instability and absent rheumatoid factor. JIA affects approximately 1 in 1,000 children in any given year, with about 1 in 10,000 having a more severe form.|Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the term used to describe a group of inflammatory articular disorders of unknown cause that begin before the age of 16 and last over 6 weeks. The term juvenile idiopathic arthritis was chosen to signify the absence of any known mechanism underlying the disorder and to highlight the necessity of excluding other types of arthritis occurring in well defined diseases (in particular arthritis occurring in association with infectious, inflammatory and haematooncologic diseases).
GWAS_EFO_0003898: ankylosing spondylitis - A chronic inflammatory condition affecting the axial joints, such as the SACROILIAC JOINT and other intervertebral or costovertebral joints.

It is commonly defined as a body mass index (weight divided by height squared) of 30 kg/m2 or higher.|A status with BODY WEIGHT that is grossly above the acceptable or desirable weight, usually due to accumulation of excess FATS in the body. The standards may vary with age, sex, genetic or cultural background. In the BODY MASS INDEX, a BMI greater than 30.0 kg/m2 is considered obese, and a BMI greater than 40.0 kg/m2 is considered morbidly obese (MORBID OBESITY).|A disorder involving an excessive amount of body fat.|Obesity is a complex disease that may involve multiple environmental and genetic causes.
