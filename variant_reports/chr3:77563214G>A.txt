GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0009750: dissociation measurement - Quantification of some aspect of the psychological experience of dissociation. Dissociation in community samples is most commonly measured by the Dissociative Experiences Scale. The DSM-IV considers symptoms such as depersonalization, derealization and psychogenic amnesia to be core features of dissociative disorders.
