# GWAS INFO
GWAS ASSOCIATIONS DATABASE:
GWAS_EFO_0004747: protein measurement - This is a general class for any measurement of a protein. Do not annotate to this class, request a more specific child term.|Is a quantification of some protein, typically obtained from an individual with the intention of using the measurement in some diagnostic process.
GWAS_EFO_0006335: systolic blood pressure - The blood pressure during the contraction of the left ventricle of the heart.
GWAS_EFO_0006525: cigarettes per day measurement - the quantification of the number of cigarettes that a subject smoked on average per day
GWAS_EFO_0000289: bipolar disorder - A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence.|A major affective disorder marked by severe mood swings (manic or major depressive episodes) and a tendency to remission and recurrence (MeSH).|A disorder of the brain that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. Often these moods range and shift from periods of elation and energized behavior to those of hopelessness and depression.
GWAS_EFO_0004340: body mass index - An indicator of body density as determined by the relationship of BODY WEIGHT to BODY HEIGHT. BMI=weight (kg)/height squared (m2). BMI correlates with body fat (ADIPOSE TISSUE). Their relationship varies with age and gender. For adults, BMI falls into these categories: below 18.5 (underweight); 18.5-24.9 (normal); 25.0-29.9 (overweight); 30.0 and above (obese).
