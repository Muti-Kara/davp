Your job is to prepare a mock clinical epicrisis for this sample.\n\nYou're given the following information about the target diseases:\n<disease_info>\nFor **Retinitis Pigmentosa 45 (RP45)**, a subtype of retinitis pigmentosa caused by specific genetic mutations, the following information addresses your questions:\n\n1. **General \/ Common Symptoms:**\n   - Night blindness (difficulty seeing in low light or darkness) is typically the earliest and most common symptom, often beginning in childhood[1][3][5][16].\n   - Gradual loss of peripheral vision leading to tunnel vision, where only central vision remains[1][3][5][7][11][13][16].\n   - Progressive constriction of visual fields and eventual involvement of central vision in later stages[3][16].\n   - Other common signs include sensitivity to bright light and loss of color vision, especially blue[1][5].\n   - Fundoscopic examination often reveals the classic triad of bone-spicule pigmentation, attenuation of retinal blood vessels, and waxy pallor of the optic nerve head[3][9].\n\n2. **Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms:**\n   - Some patients may experience syndromic forms where RP is associated with other systemic problems like hearing loss or obesity, but these are less common and not specific to RP45 alone[1].\n   - Sudden onset of symptoms is rare and usually suggests alternative diagnoses such as autoimmune retinopathy or paraneoplastic retinopathy, rather than typical RP progression[1].\n   - Macular edema and posterior subcapsular cataracts can complicate the disease in some cases[9].\n   - Cystoid macular edema has been reported more frequently in female patients with certain RP gene mutations, including PRPF31, which may be relevant for some RP45 cases[2].\n\n3. **Specific Gender or Age Group Predilection:**\n   - RP45 symptoms usually begin in childhood or early adulthood, with night blindness often noted in childhood and progressive vision loss developing over decades[1][5][11][16].\n   - There is evidence suggesting a **female preponderance** in some RP gene mutations, including PRPF31-associated RP, with females possibly experiencing faster disease progression and higher susceptibility to complications like cystoid macular edema[2][4].\n   - However, epidemiological data show variability by region and gene subtype: some studies report a higher prevalence in males in the US and Europe, while in Japan females predominate[2][6].\n   - Animal model studies (rd10 mice) indicate females may have earlier onset and faster progression of retinal degeneration, which could have clinical implications[4].\n\nIn summary, RP45 typically presents with **progressive night blindness and tunnel vision starting in childhood or early adulthood**, with **possible female predominance and faster progression** in females. Rare symptoms include syndromic associations and complications like macular edema.

For example, some syndromes may present with benign skin lesions or other non-cancerous manifestations before cancer develops. Certain syndromes like Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome can cause **shortness of breath and chest pain** due to lung cysts that may collapse.[3] Li-Fraumeni syndrome and other syndromes may be associated with various benign physical features depending on the underlying genetic mutation.[4]\n\n## Gender and Age Group Susceptibility\n\nHereditary cancer-predisposing syndromes affect **both males and females equally**, as most are inherited in an **autosomal dominant pattern**, meaning both sexes can inherit and pass on the mutation.[5] However, the **age of onset varies by syndrome type**.

Approximately one in 20,000 individuals worldwide are affected by this condition[1].\n\n## General and Common Symptoms\n\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome itself does not present specific warning signs; rather, symptoms depend on the type of cancer that develops[1][5]. The most common cancers associated with LFS include soft tissue and bone sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenocortical carcinoma, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia[1][7].\n\n**Soft tissue sarcomas** present as painless lumps and swelling in the limbs or trunk[1]. **Breast cancer** typically manifests as lumps or changes in breast tissue, often diagnosed before age 30[1]. **Brain tumors** cause headaches, seizures, nausea, and neurological changes[1]. **Adrenocortical carcinoma** produces hormonal imbalances, unexplained weight changes, and abdominal pain[1]. **Osteosarcoma** results in bone pain, swelling, and fractures[1].\n\nGeneral indicators of LFS include aches, pains, lumps, headaches, loss of appetite, and unexplained weight loss[5]. A family history of cancer with several relatives having early-onset cancers is also a significant indicator[1].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nWhile less frequently reported than core cancers, LFS is also linked to gastric, lung, kidney, thyroid, skin (melanoma), prostate, and ovarian cancers[1]. Additional rare cancers include choroid plexus carcinoma, lymphoma, germ cell tumors, Wilms tumor, and colorectal cancer[4].\n\nFor children specifically, red flag warning signs requiring medical attention include persistent headaches (often worse in the morning), morning nausea or vomiting, unsteady gait or poor coordination, drooling and difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, seizures of any type, vision changes or abnormal eye movements, personality changes, excessive bruising or bleeding, unexplained bumps or lumps that do not shrink, joint pain or swelling, swollen abdomen with persistent constipation, and signs of early puberty in children under 10 years old[3].\n\n## Gender and Age Susceptibility\n\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome affects both males and females, but there are significant gender differences in cancer risk and age of onset[2][4]. **Females face substantially higher lifetime cancer risk**, with a 93% likelihood of developing cancer by age 50, compared to 68% in males[2][4]. The specific cumulative risks for female carriers are 18% by age 20, 49% by age 30, 77% by age 40, and 93% by age 50[4]. For males, the cumulative risks are 10%, 21%, 33%, and 68% at the same respective ages[4].\n\nFemales also experience earlier average age of onset at 29 years compared to 40 years in men[2]. This excess female risk is primarily driven by their markedly increased predisposition to breast cancer; almost all females with LFS develop breast cancer[1][2]. Even when excluding sex-specific cancers, females show higher risk for brain and lung cancers[4].\n\nRegarding age groups, approximately one-third of LFS-related cancers occur before age 18, half before age 30, and most by age 50[10]. Individuals with LFS have approximately a 50% chance of developing cancer by age 40 and up to a 90% chance by age 60[1][7]. The average onset of first cancer for men with LFS was age 17 years, while for women it was age 28 years[8].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target diseases.

Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms:**\n- Liver cysts (polycystic liver disease), though less common and less severe than in PKD1.\n- Cysts in other organs (e.g., pancreas, spleen).\n- Cardiovascular abnormalities (e.g., heart valve issues, arterial aneurysms).\n- Diverticulosis of the colon.\n- Rarely, early-onset disease in childhood or adolescence.\n\n**3. Specific Gender or Age Group More Likely to Get the Disease:**\n- **Age:** Symptoms typically appear later in adulthood (often after age 40), and progression is generally milder than in PKD1-related disease.\n- **Gender:** There is no strong gender predisposition for developing PKD2-related disorder, but women with PKD2 mutations tend to have a less severe form of the disease compared to men.\n\n---\n\n### **Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)**\n\n**1. General \/ Common Symptoms:**\n- Bilateral kidney cysts and kidney enlargement.\n- Hypertension (high blood pressure).\n- Abdominal or flank pain.\n- Hematuria (blood in urine).\n- Urinary tract infections.\n- Kidney stones (nephrolithiasis).\n- Progressive decline in kidney function, leading to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in many patients by age 60–70.\n\n**2. Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms:**\n- Liver cysts (polycystic liver disease), which are more common and severe in women.\n- Cysts in the pancreas, spleen, thyroid, seminal vesicles, and prostate.\n- Cardiovascular abnormalities (e.g., left ventricular hypertrophy, aortic root dilatation, arterial aneurysms, heart valve issues, intracranial aneurysms).\n- Bronchiectasis.\n- Diverticulosis and severe diverticulitis.\n- Abdominal wall hernias.\n- Rarely, early-onset disease in childhood or even *in utero*.\n\n**3. Specific Gender or Age Group More Likely to Get the Disease:**\n- **Age:** Symptoms usually begin between ages 30 and 40, but can appear earlier or later. Rarely, symptoms may present in childhood.\n- **Gender:** ADPKD affects both men and women equally in terms of prevalence. However, men tend to have more severe renal disease and are more prone to kidney stones, while women are more likely to develop polycystic liver disease and may experience more symptoms like chronic pain and microhematuria.\n\n---\n\n### **Polycystic Kidney Disease 2 (PKD2)**\n\n**Note:** \"Polycystic Kidney Disease 2\" is synonymous with PKD2-related disorder and refers to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease caused by mutations in the *PKD2* gene.\n\n**1. General \/ Common Symptoms:**\n- Kidney cysts and kidney enlargement.\n- Hypertension.\n- Abdominal or flank pain.\n- Hematuria.\n- Urinary tract infections.\n- Kidney stones.\n- Slower progression to end-stage kidney disease compared to PKD1.\n\n**2. Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms:**\n- Liver cysts (less common and less severe than in PKD1).\n- Cysts in other organs (pancreas, spleen).\n- Cardiovascular abnormalities.\n- Diverticulosis.\n- Rarely, early-onset disease in childhood.\n\n**3. Specific Gender or Age Group More Likely to Get the Disease:**\n- **Age:** Symptoms typically appear later in adulthood (after age 40), with a milder disease course.\n- **Gender:** No strong gender predisposition for developing the disease, but women with PKD2 mutations tend to have a less severe form of the disease compared to men.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Disease Name                        | Common Symptoms                                                                 | Rare\/Uncommon Symptoms                                                                 | Gender\/Age Group More Likely         |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| PKD2-related disorder               | Kidney cysts, hypertension, pain, hematuria, UTIs, kidney stones, ESKD          | Liver cysts, cysts in other organs, cardiovascular issues, diverticulosis, early onset | Later adulthood, women less severe   |\n| Autosomal dominant PKD              | Kidney cysts, hypertension, pain, hematuria, UTIs, kidney stones, ESKD          | Liver cysts (more in women), cysts in other organs, cardiovascular issues, diverticulosis, early onset | 30–40s, men more severe renal disease, women more liver cysts |\n| Polycystic Kidney Disease 2 (PKD2)  | Kidney cysts, hypertension, pain, hematuria, UTIs, kidney stones, ESKD          | Liver cysts, cysts in other organs, cardiovascular issues, diverticulosis, early onset | Later adulthood, women less severe   |\n<\/disease_info>\n\nFor this sample, you need to create a fake profile of the patient and their symptoms!\nSince its an exam, while the symptoms should be as sufficient enough to make a diagnosis, it shouldn't be so obvious!\nAdditionally, if these diseases are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\nIn your fake profile, you can add short familial history in your symptom list especially when the inheritance is important for the disease's context.\n\nFor blurring the symptoms, you can use the following tricks:\n1.

Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms:**\n- Seizures (sometimes the first symptom prompting medical attention).\n- Paralysis due to severe low potassium (hypokalemia), especially in Asian populations.\n- Growth retardation, delayed puberty, or short stature.\n- Breakdown of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis), which can lead to kidney damage.\n- Blurred vision.\n- Difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia).\n- Severe low potassium and magnesium in newborns or infants, with symptoms like frequent urination, low muscle tone, and growth delays.\n- Sudden cardiac death due to severe arrhythmias (very rare).\n- High blood pressure later in life (around age 55), despite low blood pressure earlier.\n- Severe potassium wasting during pregnancy in women.\n\n**3. Specific Gender or Age Group More Likely to Be Affected:**\n- Gitelman syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning it affects males and females equally.\n- Symptoms typically appear in late childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, with most cases diagnosed during these periods. However, it can occasionally be diagnosed in children or even newborns.\n- There is no strong evidence for a specific gender predominance, but some studies suggest that severe phenotypic expression (such as growth retardation and ventricular arrhythmias) may be more common in males.\n- The condition is more frequently recognized in individuals of white ethnic background, with about 1% of this population being heterozygous carriers.\n<\/disease_info>\n\nFor this sample, you need to create a fake profile of the patient and their symptoms!\nSince its an exam, while the symptoms should be as sufficient enough to make a diagnosis, it shouldn't be so obvious!\nAdditionally, if these diseases are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\nIn your fake profile, you can add short familial history in your symptom list especially when the inheritance is important for the disease's context.\n\nFor blurring the symptoms, you can use the following tricks:\n1.

Chronic nasal congestion with thick nasal drainage is nearly universal, often leading to sinusitis[1][12]. Many patients also suffer from recurring pneumonia or bronchitis, along with chronic wheezing and excess mucus that is difficult to clear[1][2].\n\n**Ear and sinus involvement** is common, with recurrent middle ear infections (otitis media) affecting approximately half of all children with PCD[9]. These infections can lead to permanent hearing loss if left untreated[5]. Chronic sinus infections are also typical[1].\n\n**Neonatal presentation** is significant, as approximately 75% of children with PCD experience respiratory distress at birth, often requiring supplemental oxygen for days or weeks[9]. Most infants develop symptoms within the first few months of life, including a runny nose or rattly wet cough[6].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nBeyond the common respiratory manifestations, PCD can present with several less frequent complications:\n\n**Organ positioning abnormalities** occur in a substantial minority of patients. Approximately 40-50% of individuals with PCD have situs inversus totalis, where internal organs including the heart, liver, spleen, and intestines are positioned on the opposite side of the body[5][6][7]. While this mirror-image reversal typically does not cause additional health problems itself, when it occurs alongside chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis, the condition is termed Kartagener syndrome[1][2].\n\n**Heterotaxy syndrome** (also called situs ambiguous) is present in approximately 9-12% of PCD patients[5]. This condition involves abnormal positioning and structure of organs such as the heart, liver, intestines, or spleen. Some affected individuals may lack a spleen (asplenia) or have multiple spleens (polysplenia)[5]. Importantly, heterotaxy can include structural congenital heart defects that may be life-threatening[7].\n\n**Skeletal abnormalities** have been reported rarely, occurring in 5-10% of patients, including pectus excavatum (sunken chest), scoliosis, and digital clubbing (swelling at the fingertips)[6].\n\n**Neurological complications** are very rare but can occur. Some individuals with PCD develop hydrocephalus (accumulation of fluid in the brain), though researchers do not fully understand why this occurs in some patients[5].\n\n**Fertility issues** represent another category of complications. Almost all males with PCD are infertile due to dysmotility of spermatozoa, though a few have normal sperm motility[6]. Women with PCD may experience reduced fertility or ectopic pregnancies due to abnormal cilia in the fallopian tubes[5][7].\n\n## Gender and Age Susceptibility\n\n**Gender distribution** shows a notable male predominance in PCD diagnosis. In recent studies, the male-to-female ratio among children with PCD is approximately 2.3:1, which is significantly higher than the expected 1:1 ratio[8]. However, this likely reflects diagnostic bias rather than true disease prevalence, as females may be underdiagnosed.\n\n**Fertility differences by gender** are pronounced. Subfertility affects up to 83% of men with PCD compared to up to 61% of women with PCD[3], making male infertility a more consistent feature of the disease.\n\n**Age of onset** is predominantly early childhood. Most people with PCD develop symptoms from birth or within the first few months of life[6]. However, some children may not receive a diagnosis until school age, having experienced numerous infections and antibiotic courses during the diagnostic delay[9]. In rare cases, PCD is not diagnosed until adulthood[6].\n\n**Prevalence** is estimated at approximately 1 in 12,000 to 1 in 30,000 live births, though recent genomic studies suggest the actual prevalence may be higher at around 13.2 per 100,000 people[2][10]. The condition is particularly common among children and adults in Amish and Mennonite communities in the Midwest[2].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target diseases.

General\/Common Symptoms of Inborn Genetic Diseases\n\n- **Neurological symptoms:** Movement abnormalities (tremors, ataxia, dystonia), muscle weakness, coordination and balance issues, cognitive decline, developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, sensory impairments (vision, hearing), and behavioral or mental health changes (anxiety, depression)[1].\n- **Physical abnormalities:** Distinctive facial features, joint problems, abnormal development of bones or muscles, skin and tissue changes (e.g., softening or deterioration), and congenital malformations such as heart defects, cleft palate, or limb abnormalities[2][3][9].\n- **Metabolic symptoms:** Failure to thrive, delayed physical and intellectual development, enzyme deficiencies leading to accumulation of toxic substances (e.g., phenylketonuria), and organ damage due to metabolic imbalances[2][5].\n- **Cardiovascular symptoms:** Congenital heart defects (e.g., Tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted aortic arch), vascular malformations, and blood clotting abnormalities[2][3].\n- **Other systemic symptoms:** Immune deficiencies, low calcium levels, gastrointestinal reflux, excessive sweating, cyanosis (bluish skin tint), and feeding difficulties[3].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Rare\/Uncommon Symptoms of Inborn Genetic Diseases\n\n- **Unusual or rare neurological signs:** Involuntary jerky movements (chorea), nerve pain, sensory abnormalities like numbness or tingling[1].\n- **Specific syndromic features:** Port-wine stain birthmarks (Sturge-Weber syndrome), hamartomas (PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome), soft tissue deterioration on one side of the face (Parry Romberg syndrome), and unusual behavioral phenotypes such as limitless appetite (Prader-Willi syndrome)[2][4].\n- **Rare blood disorders:** Abnormal blood clotting (thrombophilia), sickle-shaped red blood cells causing anemia and organ damage (sickle cell disease), and rare bleeding disorders (Von Willebrand disease)[2][4].\n- **Rare enzyme deficiencies:** Deficiencies causing specific metabolic crises or progressive neurological deterioration (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease, Krabbe disease, Hunter syndrome)[4][5].\n- **Chromosomal abnormalities:** Trisomies and monosomies leading to complex multisystem involvement including intellectual disability, heart defects, and physical malformations[2].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Specific Gender or Age Group Predilection\n\n- **Age group:** Many inborn genetic diseases present symptoms from birth or early childhood, such as Stickler syndrome, Noonan syndrome, phenylketonuria, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome[2][3][4]. However, some neurological genetic disorders may not manifest until adulthood or later in life (e.g., Huntington's disease)[1][4].\n- **Gender:** Some genetic diseases are sex-linked or show gender predilection:\n  - **X-linked disorders:** More common in males (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Klinefelter syndrome affects males with an extra X chromosome)[4][8].\n  - **Turner syndrome:** Affects females with a missing or partially missing X chromosome[4].\n  - Other disorders may affect both genders equally unless linked to sex chromosomes or hormones[1][7].\n- **Ethnic or genetic background:** Certain diseases are more prevalent in specific populations (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease is more common in certain genetic groups)[4].\n\n---\n\nThis overview covers a broad spectrum of inborn genetic diseases, highlighting common and rare symptoms and demographic tendencies.

Their symptoms, affected populations, and severity vary significantly depending on the specific disorder.\n\nHere is a synthesis of the most relevant information about common inborn genetic diseases, addressing your three questions:\n\n---\n\n### 1. General\/Common Symptoms of Inborn Genetic Diseases\n\n- **Neurological symptoms:** Movement abnormalities (tremors, ataxia, dystonia), muscle weakness, coordination and balance issues, cognitive decline, developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, sensory impairments (vision, hearing), and behavioral or mental health changes (anxiety, depression)[1].\n- **Physical abnormalities:** Distinctive facial features, joint problems, abnormal development of bones or muscles, skin and tissue changes (e.g., softening or deterioration), and congenital malformations such as heart defects, cleft palate, or limb abnormalities[2][3][9].\n- **Metabolic symptoms:** Failure to thrive, delayed physical and intellectual development, enzyme deficiencies leading to accumulation of toxic substances (e.g., phenylketonuria), and organ damage due to metabolic imbalances[2][5].\n- **Cardiovascular symptoms:** Congenital heart defects (e.g., Tetralogy of Fallot, interrupted aortic arch), vascular malformations, and blood clotting abnormalities[2][3].\n- **Other systemic symptoms:** Immune deficiencies, low calcium levels, gastrointestinal reflux, excessive sweating, cyanosis (bluish skin tint), and feeding difficulties[3].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Rare\/Uncommon Symptoms of Inborn Genetic Diseases\n\n- **Unusual or rare neurological signs:** Involuntary jerky movements (chorea), nerve pain, sensory abnormalities like numbness or tingling[1].\n- **Specific syndromic features:** Port-wine stain birthmarks (Sturge-Weber syndrome), hamartomas (PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome), soft tissue deterioration on one side of the face (Parry Romberg syndrome), and unusual behavioral phenotypes such as limitless appetite (Prader-Willi syndrome)[2][4].\n- **Rare blood disorders:** Abnormal blood clotting (thrombophilia), sickle-shaped red blood cells causing anemia and organ damage (sickle cell disease), and rare bleeding disorders (Von Willebrand disease)[2][4].\n- **Rare enzyme deficiencies:** Deficiencies causing specific metabolic crises or progressive neurological deterioration (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease, Krabbe disease, Hunter syndrome)[4][5].\n- **Chromosomal abnormalities:** Trisomies and monosomies leading to complex multisystem involvement including intellectual disability, heart defects, and physical malformations[2].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Specific Gender or Age Group Predilection\n\n- **Age group:** Many inborn genetic diseases present symptoms from birth or early childhood, such as Stickler syndrome, Noonan syndrome, phenylketonuria, and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome[2][3][4]. However, some neurological genetic disorders may not manifest until adulthood or later in life (e.g., Huntington's disease)[1][4].\n- **Gender:** Some genetic diseases are sex-linked or show gender predilection:\n  - **X-linked disorders:** More common in males (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Klinefelter syndrome affects males with an extra X chromosome)[4][8].\n  - **Turner syndrome:** Affects females with a missing or partially missing X chromosome[4].\n  - Other disorders may affect both genders equally unless linked to sex chromosomes or hormones[1][7].\n- **Ethnic or genetic background:** Certain diseases are more prevalent in specific populations (e.g., Tay-Sachs disease is more common in certain genetic groups)[4].\n\n---\n\nThis overview covers a broad spectrum of inborn genetic diseases, highlighting common and rare symptoms and demographic tendencies. Specific diseases mentioned include Stickler syndrome, Noonan syndrome, phenylketonuria, Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell disease, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and many others, each with distinct symptom profiles and affected populations[1][2][3][4][5][8].\n<\/disease_info>\n\nFor this sample, you need to create a fake profile of the patient and their symptoms!\nSince its an exam, while the symptoms should be as sufficient enough to make a diagnosis, it shouldn't be so obvious!\nAdditionally, if these diseases are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\nIn your fake profile, you can add short familial history in your symptom list especially when the inheritance is important for the disease's context.\n\nFor blurring the symptoms, you can use the following tricks:\n1.

Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to get the disease?\n","search_results":"# Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT)\n\n## General and Common Symptoms\n\nThe most prevalent symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia include:\n\n**Nosebleeds (Epistaxis)** are by far the most common manifestation, affecting approximately 90-95% of people with HHT[1][8]. These typically begin around age 12 and are often the earliest symptom of the disease[1][14]. The frequency and severity of nosebleeds vary widely among individuals[5].\n\n**Telangiectasia** (small red or purple spots) appear in 90-95% of patients, typically on the skin of the hands, face, and mouth, though they may not become visible until age 30 or 40[1]. These delicate lesions appear as tiny spots between the size of a pinpoint and pinhead and have a tendency to become more numerous with age[1].\n\n**Anemia and Iron Deficiency** occur in approximately 50% of HHT patients, primarily as a consequence of nasal and gastrointestinal bleeding[1]. This can lead to secondary symptoms including shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, and fatigue[1].\n\n**Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding** affects approximately 80% of HHT patients who have telangiectasia in the stomach or intestines, though only about 30% develop obvious GI bleeding, which typically begins when patients are 50 or 60 years old[1]. Symptoms include black or bloody stools[1].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nWhile less common, HHT can cause serious complications affecting major organ systems:\n\n**Neurological complications** include ischemic stroke, brain abscess, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), hemorrhagic stroke, and seizures, primarily resulting from pulmonary or cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)[1][5].\n\n**Pulmonary complications** stem from lung AVMs and may manifest as coughing up blood, chronic hypoxemia, or rarely, hemorrhagic rupture[3].\n\n**Hepatic (Liver) involvement** occurs in a limited proportion of patients and can lead to severe complications including high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, ischemic cholangitis, abdominal pain, abnormal liver function tests, fluid in the abdomen (ascites), and enlarged blood vessels in the esophagus (varices)[1][5].\n\n**Cardiac complications** such as heart failure can result from severe hepatic vascular malformations[5].\n\n**Other rare symptoms** include back pain, swelling, or numbness[1].\n\n## Gender and Age Patterns\n\n**Gender Differences:** Women are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with HHT than men, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 3.25:1 in some populations, though other studies report ratios around 1.7:1 to 1.88:1[2][4]. This discrepancy may reflect either underdiagnosis in males or higher penetrance and symptom severity in females[2].\n\nWomen show more severe manifestations in specific areas: they have higher prevalence of hepatic involvement, hepatic AVMs, bile duct dilatation, and pulmonary AVMs compared to men[4]. Women also require invasive treatments more frequently than men[4]. Conversely, men present with duodenal telangiectasia more frequently than women[4].\n\n**Age of Onset:** Nosebleeds typically begin around age 12 on average[14].

Your job is to prepare a mock clinical epicrisis for this sample.\n\nYou're given the following information about the target diseases:\n<disease_info>\n# Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT)\n\n## General and Common Symptoms\n\nThe most prevalent symptoms of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia include:\n\n**Nosebleeds (Epistaxis)** are by far the most common manifestation, affecting approximately 90-95% of people with HHT[1][8]. These typically begin around age 12 and are often the earliest symptom of the disease[1][14]. The frequency and severity of nosebleeds vary widely among individuals[5].\n\n**Telangiectasia** (small red or purple spots) appear in 90-95% of patients, typically on the skin of the hands, face, and mouth, though they may not become visible until age 30 or 40[1]. These delicate lesions appear as tiny spots between the size of a pinpoint and pinhead and have a tendency to become more numerous with age[1].\n\n**Anemia and Iron Deficiency** occur in approximately 50% of HHT patients, primarily as a consequence of nasal and gastrointestinal bleeding[1]. This can lead to secondary symptoms including shortness of breath, exercise intolerance, and fatigue[1].\n\n**Gastrointestinal (GI) Bleeding** affects approximately 80% of HHT patients who have telangiectasia in the stomach or intestines, though only about 30% develop obvious GI bleeding, which typically begins when patients are 50 or 60 years old[1]. Symptoms include black or bloody stools[1].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nWhile less common, HHT can cause serious complications affecting major organ systems:\n\n**Neurological complications** include ischemic stroke, brain abscess, transient ischemic attacks (TIA), hemorrhagic stroke, and seizures, primarily resulting from pulmonary or cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)[1][5].\n\n**Pulmonary complications** stem from lung AVMs and may manifest as coughing up blood, chronic hypoxemia, or rarely, hemorrhagic rupture[3].\n\n**Hepatic (Liver) involvement** occurs in a limited proportion of patients and can lead to severe complications including high-output cardiac failure, portal hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, ischemic cholangitis, abdominal pain, abnormal liver function tests, fluid in the abdomen (ascites), and enlarged blood vessels in the esophagus (varices)[1][5].\n\n**Cardiac complications** such as heart failure can result from severe hepatic vascular malformations[5].\n\n**Other rare symptoms** include back pain, swelling, or numbness[1].\n\n## Gender and Age Patterns\n\n**Gender Differences:** Women are significantly more likely to be diagnosed with HHT than men, with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 3.25:1 in some populations, though other studies report ratios around 1.7:1 to 1.88:1[2][4]. This discrepancy may reflect either underdiagnosis in males or higher penetrance and symptom severity in females[2].\n\nWomen show more severe manifestations in specific areas: they have higher prevalence of hepatic involvement, hepatic AVMs, bile duct dilatation, and pulmonary AVMs compared to men[4]. Women also require invasive treatments more frequently than men[4]. Conversely, men present with duodenal telangiectasia more frequently than women[4].\n\n**Age of Onset:** Nosebleeds typically begin around age 12 on average[14]. Telangiectasia on the skin generally become visible between ages 30-40[1]. GI bleeding usually starts when patients are 50 or 60 years old[1]. The age of onset for AVM-related complications is highly variable, ranging from childhood to geriatric age, with rare cases reported during the neonatal period[3].\n<\/disease_info>\n\nFor this sample, you need to create a fake profile of the patient and their symptoms!\nSince its an exam, while the symptoms should be as sufficient enough to make a diagnosis, it shouldn't be so obvious!\nAdditionally, if these diseases are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\nIn your fake profile, you can add short familial history in your symptom list especially when the inheritance is important for the disease's context.\n\nFor blurring the symptoms, you can use the following tricks:\n1.

Affected individuals experience a chronic wet cough that produces sputum, often beginning in infancy and persisting for extended periods.[12] Chronic nasal congestion with thick nasal drainage is nearly universal, leading to recurrent or chronic sinusitis.[1][2] Many patients develop recurrent pneumonia or bronchitis, with some experiencing respiratory distress as newborns that may require supplemental oxygen or breathing support for days or weeks.[1][2]\n\n**Ear and hearing complications** are also common, with recurrent middle ear infections (otitis media) affecting approximately half of all children with PCD.[9] These infections can lead to permanent hearing loss if left untreated and may result in glue ear or other hearing problems.[9]\n\n**Progressive lung damage** occurs as a consequence of chronic infections. Bronchiectasis—the dilation and weakening of bronchial tubes—develops in an age-dependent manner and is nearly universal in adults with PCD.[6] This progressive scarring and dilatation of the airways can lead to severe, irreversible lung damage.[7]\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nWhile less common than respiratory manifestations, PCD can affect multiple organ systems:\n\n**Organ positioning abnormalities** occur in a significant minority of patients. Approximately 40-50% of individuals with PCD have situs inversus totalis, a mirror-image reversal of internal organs where the heart appears on the right side of the chest instead of the left.[1][2][5] This condition is known as Kartagener syndrome when it occurs alongside chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis. Heterotaxy syndrome (situs ambiguous), characterized by abnormal positioning and structure of organs like the heart, liver, intestines, or spleen, occurs in 9-12% of PCD patients and can include serious, life-threatening cardiac abnormalities.[5][7]\n\n**Neurological complications** are rare but documented. Hydrocephalus (accumulation of fluid in the brain) has been reported in rare cases, though researchers do not fully understand why some individuals develop this condition.[5]\n\n**Skeletal abnormalities** such as pectus excavatum (sunken chest), scoliosis, and digital clubbing (swelling at the fingertips) have been reported in 5-10% of patients.[6]\n\n**Fertility issues** represent another system affected by ciliary dysfunction. Almost all males with PCD experience infertility due to dysmotility of sperm, though a small percentage may have normal sperm motility.[6] Subfertility affects up to 83% of men with PCD and up to 61% of women, with female infertility likely resulting from abnormal cilia in the fallopian tubes that impair egg movement.[8]\n\n## Age and Gender Patterns\n\n**Age of onset:** PCD is a congenital condition with symptoms typically appearing at birth or within the first few months of life.[6] Approximately 75% of children with PCD experience trouble breathing after birth.[9] However, diagnostic delays are common, and some cases are not identified until school age or even adulthood due to symptom overlap with common childhood illnesses.[6][9]\n\n**Gender differences:** Males and females are equally susceptible to PCD itself, as the condition follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.[8] However, gender-specific complications differ significantly. Males are almost universally affected by infertility, whereas females experience reduced fertility at lower rates (up to 61% compared to 83% in males).[8] Additionally, males with PCD may have decreased fertility due to abnormal sperm motility, while females may experience infertility related to fallopian tube dysfunction or ectopic pregnancies.[5][8]\n\n**Prevalence:** PCD affects approximately 1 in 15,000 people in the UK, though estimates range from 1 in 7,554 to 1 in 30,000 globally, with higher prevalence observed in individuals of African ancestry.[3][9][10] The condition is particularly common among Amish and Mennonite communities in the Midwest.[2]","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target diseases.

Consanguinity increases risk due to recessive inheritance[2][4][5][6].\n   - The incidence is approximately 1 in 25,000 to 50,000 newborns, with some populations having higher prevalence[3][5].\n\n**Additional context:**\n\n- The disease can be **diffuse** (whole pancreas affected) or **focal** (localized area affected), with similar symptoms but different genetic and pathological bases[1][8][9].\n- Mutations in genes such as **ABCC8** and **KCNJ11** (encoding components of the pancreatic beta-cell potassium channel) are the most common causes[2][4][6][8].\n- Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent brain damage from hypoglycemia.

Infants with MCPH have an unusually small head circumference compared to other infants of the same sex and age, typically measuring more than two standard deviations below the mean[3].\n\nThe most prevalent symptoms include:\n\n**Developmental and Cognitive Features**\n- **Intellectual disability**, typically mild to moderate in severity, which is non-progressive[1][3][5]\n- **Delayed speech and language development**[1][5]\n- **Global developmental delay**[1]\n- Mildly delayed motor skill development, including delays in sitting, standing, and walking[1][5]\n\n**Physical Characteristics**\n- **Narrow, sloping forehead**[1][2][5]\n- Small cerebral cortex with a simplified gyral pattern on brain imaging[1][3]\n- Proportionately small-sized brain with normal architecture[3]\n- Poor weight gain and growth[6]\n- Short stature compared to family members[1][5]\n\n**Neurological Features**\n- **Hyperactivity and attention problems**[1][2]\n- Behavioral issues[1][2]\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nWhile most individuals with MCPH have the core features described above, some less common manifestations include:\n\n- **Mild seizures**, occurring in approximately 10% of cases[3][5]\n- **Sensorineural hearing impairment**[1]\n- **Proptosis** (protruding eyes)[1]\n- Vision problems[6]\n- Joint deformities[6]\n- Muscle stiffness and control problems[6]\n- Coordination and balance difficulties[6]\n\nImportantly, MCPH typically does **not** affect other major organ systems or cause additional health problems beyond the neurological manifestations[2][5].\n\n## Gender and Age Group Susceptibility\n\nThe search results do not indicate that autosomal recessive primary microcephaly shows a **gender preference**—the condition affects males and females equally[5].\n\nRegarding age, MCPH is characterized by **antenatal and neonatal onset**[3]. The condition is present at birth or develops in early infancy, with microcephaly observable as early as week 32 of pregnancy[3]. Head circumference is significantly reduced at birth, measuring at least 2 standard deviations below ethnically matched, age- and sex-related mean values[3]. Subsequent head growth is very slow, with head circumference worsening during infancy to below -3 standard deviations before 6 months of age, and typically between -4 and -12 standard deviations in adults[3].\n\n**Population-Specific Prevalence**\nWhile not specific to a particular age group, MCPH shows higher prevalence in certain populations. The condition is more common in Asian and Middle Eastern populations than in Caucasians, with an annual incidence of 1 in 1,000,000 reported in Caucasians[3].

Infants with MCPH have an unusually small head circumference compared to other infants of the same sex and age, typically measuring more than two standard deviations below the mean[3].\n\nThe most prevalent symptoms include:\n\n**Developmental and Cognitive Features**\n- **Intellectual disability**, typically mild to moderate in severity, which is non-progressive[1][3][5]\n- **Delayed speech and language development**[1][5]\n- **Global developmental delay**[1]\n- Mildly delayed motor skill development, including delays in sitting, standing, and walking[1][5]\n\n**Physical Characteristics**\n- **Narrow, sloping forehead**[1][2][5]\n- Small cerebral cortex with a simplified gyral pattern on brain imaging[1][3]\n- Proportionately small-sized brain with normal architecture[3]\n- Poor weight gain and growth[6]\n- Short stature compared to family members[1][5]\n\n**Neurological Features**\n- **Hyperactivity and attention problems**[1][2]\n- Behavioral issues[1][2]\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nWhile most individuals with MCPH have the core features described above, some less common manifestations include:\n\n- **Mild seizures**, occurring in approximately 10% of cases[3][5]\n- **Sensorineural hearing impairment**[1]\n- **Proptosis** (protruding eyes)[1]\n- Vision problems[6]\n- Joint deformities[6]\n- Muscle stiffness and control problems[6]\n- Coordination and balance difficulties[6]\n\nImportantly, MCPH typically does **not** affect other major organ systems or cause additional health problems beyond the neurological manifestations[2][5].\n\n## Gender and Age Group Susceptibility\n\nThe search results do not indicate that autosomal recessive primary microcephaly shows a **gender preference**—the condition affects males and females equally[5].\n\nRegarding age, MCPH is characterized by **antenatal and neonatal onset**[3]. The condition is present at birth or develops in early infancy, with microcephaly observable as early as week 32 of pregnancy[3]. Head circumference is significantly reduced at birth, measuring at least 2 standard deviations below ethnically matched, age- and sex-related mean values[3]. Subsequent head growth is very slow, with head circumference worsening during infancy to below -3 standard deviations before 6 months of age, and typically between -4 and -12 standard deviations in adults[3].\n\n**Population-Specific Prevalence**\nWhile not specific to a particular age group, MCPH shows higher prevalence in certain populations. The condition is more common in Asian and Middle Eastern populations than in Caucasians, with an annual incidence of 1 in 1,000,000 reported in Caucasians[3]. It is particularly prevalent in northern Pakistan, where it affects an estimated 1 in 10,000 newborns[5].\n<\/disease_info>\n\nFor this sample, you need to create a fake profile of the patient and their symptoms!\nSince its an exam, while the symptoms should be as sufficient enough to make a diagnosis, it shouldn't be so obvious!\nAdditionally, if these diseases are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\nIn your fake profile, you can add short familial history in your symptom list especially when the inheritance is important for the disease's context.\n\nFor blurring the symptoms, you can use the following tricks:\n1.

affects males and females equally.\n   - Symptoms present from birth or infancy.\n   - Incidence is very rare, about 1 in 500,000 births.\n   - Both males and females can be affected, with no difference in prevalence.\n\n---\n\n### Brachydactyly Type B1\n\n1. **General\/Common Symptoms:**\n   - Hypoplasia (underdevelopment) or aplasia (absence) of the distal phalanges (end bones) of digits 2-5 (index to little fingers and corresponding toes).\n   - Nail dysplasia or absence of nails on affected digits.\n   - Fusion of the middle and distal phalanges.\n   - Broad or bifid (split) thumbs.\n   - Occasionally, distal and proximal symphalangism (fusion of finger joints) or syndactyly (webbing or fusion of digits).\n   - Feet are generally less severely affected than hands.\n   - Usually diagnosed shortly after birth due to visible shortening or absence of finger tips and nails.\n\n2. **Rare\/Uncommon Symptoms:**\n   - Functional difficulties such as trouble grasping small objects may appear as the child grows.\n   - Severe cases may require cosmetic or functional surgery.\n   - Phenotypic variability with some individuals having more severe fusion or additional digit anomalies.\n   - No systemic involvement reported; primarily a limb malformation.\n\n3. **Gender or Age Group Predilection:**\n   - Autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with high penetrance and variable expressivity.\n   - No specific gender predilection; affects males and females equally.\n   - Symptoms are congenital and apparent at birth or early infancy.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Disease                         | Common Symptoms                                                                                      | Rare Symptoms                                                                                  | Gender\/Age Predilection                     |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| **Autosomal Recessive Robinow Syndrome** | Short stature, limb shortening, fetal facies, spinal\/rib abnormalities, genital hypoplasia, dental issues, normal intelligence mostly | Intellectual disability (~20%), cardiac\/kidney defects, early infant mortality (5-10%), vaginal atresia (rare) | Equal in males and females;

Your job is to prepare a mock clinical epicrisis for this sample.\n\nYou're given the following information about the target diseases:\n<disease_info>\nFor **Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS)**, the key information is as follows:\n\n1. **General \/ Common Symptoms:**\n   - **Immune deficiency:** Increased susceptibility to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, often starting in infancy or early childhood (e.g., ear infections, pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex)[1][3][5][7].\n   - **Eczema:** Inflammatory skin disorder with red, itchy, dry, or thickened patches, often appearing within the first month of life[1][3][5][9].\n   - **Thrombocytopenia:** Low platelet count leading to easy bruising, petechiae (small red or purplish spots), purpura (larger bruises), prolonged bleeding from minor injuries, nosebleeds, and bloody diarrhea[1][3][5][7][11].\n   - **Small platelets (microthrombocytes):** Platelets are abnormally small and dysfunctional, contributing to bleeding problems[1][3][7].\n   - **Autoimmune disorders:** Many patients develop autoimmune diseases such as hemolytic anemia, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease[1][5][7].\n   - **Increased risk of cancers:** Especially lymphoma and leukemia, occurring in up to one-third of patients[1][3][5][7].\n\n2. **Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms:**\n   - **Severe bleeding complications:** Such as brain hemorrhage, which can be life-threatening[1][2][5][7].\n   - **Severe allergies:** Including food allergies, which may be more prominent in some patients[5].\n   - **Severe autoimmune manifestations:** Such as systemic vasculitis affecting kidneys, muscles, heart, brain, or other organs, causing fever, rash, joint swelling, and gastrointestinal symptoms[7].\n   - **Delayed diagnosis in females:** Rarely, females may be affected with milder or late-onset symptoms due to X-linked inheritance, but this is uncommon[2][8].\n   - **Growth and developmental delays:** Occasionally reported, such as failure to thrive and language delay in case reports[6].\n\n3. **Gender and Age Group Most Affected:**\n   - **Primarily affects males** due to its X-linked recessive inheritance pattern; males have only one X chromosome, so a mutation in the WAS gene causes the disease[1][3][4][5][7].\n   - **Females are usually carriers** and typically asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms; affected females are extremely rare[1][2][4][8].\n   - **Symptoms usually appear in infancy or early childhood,** often within the first year of life, with eczema and bleeding signs presenting early[3][5][7].\n   - Diagnosis in females, when it occurs, tends to be at a later age (median age ~47 years) compared to males (median age ~5.5 years)[2].\n\nIn summary, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is a rare, X-linked recessive disorder predominantly affecting males, characterized by a triad of **eczema, thrombocytopenia with small platelets, and immune deficiency** leading to recurrent infections, bleeding, autoimmune diseases, and increased cancer risk. Rare severe complications include brain hemorrhage and systemic autoimmune involvement. Females are usually carriers and rarely affected.

The most prominent symptoms include:\n\n**Neurological manifestations** are the primary concern, with global developmental delay being nearly universal[2]. Affected individuals typically experience severe intellectual disability, with most patients unable to develop speech or stand and walk without support[4]. Seizures and epilepsy are common complications[2][3].\n\n**Brain abnormalities** are central to the condition and include cerebral parenchymal underdevelopment, lissencephaly, ventriculomegaly (enlarged ventricles), cerebellar hypoplasia, and brainstem dysgenesis[4][7]. Many patients also present with corpus callosum agenesis or hypoplasia[1].\n\n**Musculoskeletal features** include severe muscle hypotonia (weak muscle tone), arthrogryposis (joint contractures), and clubfeet[2][4][6]. These motor abnormalities contribute significantly to the patients' inability to ambulate independently.\n\n**Facial dysmorphism** is commonly observed, with features such as hypertelorism or hypotelorism, low-set and posteriorly rotated ears, short nose with flattened nasal bridge, and anteverted nares[3][5].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nWhile less frequently reported, additional manifestations can occur in some patients:\n\n**Cardiac and renal abnormalities** have been documented in affected individuals, representing involvement of multiple organ systems beyond the nervous system[3][5][6].\n\n**Ophthalmologic abnormalities** may include strabismus, hypermetropia, cataracts, oculomotor apraxia, small eyes, and eye movement abnormalities[1].\n\n**Skeletal variations** such as clinodactyly, overlapping fingers and toes, camptodactyly, adducted thumbs, clenched hands, and foot deformities occur in some cases[1].\n\n**Head and neck features** including macrocephaly or microcephaly, cystic hygroma, webbed neck, and plagiocephaly have been reported in certain patients[1].\n\n## Gender and Age Predisposition\n\nAlkuraya-Kucinskas Syndrome does not show a specific gender predisposition. The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning both males and females are equally likely to be affected when they inherit mutated copies of the KIAA1109 gene from both parents[3].\n\nRegarding age, the disease manifests **in utero or at birth**[1][2]. The onset occurs during fetal development, with most affected individuals dying in utero or shortly after birth[1][3]. However, a small number of surviving patients have been documented, typically presenting with severe phenotypes from infancy onward[2]. The few surviving patients reported in the literature have ranged from early childhood through adulthood, with some reaching their teens and early twenties[4]. The condition is particularly associated with consanguineous marriages, where the risk of both parents carrying the same mutation is significantly higher[3].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target diseases.

Approximately 25% of people with Carney complex develop primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD), which causes the adrenal glands to produce excessive cortisol, leading to Cushing syndrome.[4] Other endocrine manifestations include thyroid tumors, pituitary adenomas causing acromegaly, and testicular tumors.[3][12]\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nSeveral less common manifestations of Carney complex have been documented in the medical literature.[1]\n\n**Psammomatous melanotic schwannomas** occur in approximately 10% of cases.[1] These are rare tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath that can develop anywhere along the central and peripheral nervous system but most often affect the gastrointestinal tract (including the esophagus) or the paraspinal sympathetic chain.[1] Depending on their location, these tumors can cause pain, discomfort, and nerve damage (radiculopathy), and in rare cases, they can become malignant.[1]\n\n**Other uncommon skin findings** include café au lait spots (areas of light brown discoloration with irregular or jagged borders) and depigmented lesions (white patches of skin due to loss of pigment).[1]\n\n**Ovarian cysts** have been documented in some females with Carney complex, though this is not a frequent finding.[1]\n\n**Osteochondromyxomas** (bone tumors) represent another rare manifestation that can occur in patients with this syndrome.[7]\n\n## Gender and Age Distribution\n\nCarney complex affects males and females in **equal numbers** overall.[1] However, there are important gender differences in disease manifestations and timing.\n\n**Age of onset and diagnosis:** The median age of diagnosis is 20 years, though the disorder can present at any age.[1] Some features may be evident at birth, and many signs and symptoms become apparent during the teenage years or early adulthood.[1] Penetrance is near complete by age 50.[12]\n\n**Cardiac myxomas show gender differences:** By age 30, 35% of females and 45% of males had developed at least one cardiac myxoma.[2] Among patients who developed cardiac myxomas, 57.3% were females.[2] Additionally, recurrences of cardiac myxomas were more common in females, with nearly all recurrences occurring within the first 8 years for males and 16 years for females.[2]\n\n**Transmission pattern:** Interestingly, transmission of CNC occurred through a female affected parent in 43 cases compared to only 9 cases through a male parent in one study, suggesting possible non-Mendelian features in inheritance despite the autosomal dominant pattern.[5]\n\n**Fertility considerations:** Males with Carney complex may experience reduced fertility due to large cell calcifying Sertoli cell tumors (LCCSCT), which can cause replacement and obstruction of seminiferous tubules.[5]","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target diseases.

Mortality is high in the first two years of life, with about 42% dying before age 2, mainly due to respiratory failure and hyperthermic crises[2][6].\n   - Some patients survive into adolescence or later, but with persistent orthopedic and autonomic complications[1][2][6].\n   - There is a high prevalence of consanguinity among affected families, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance[2].\n\n**Summary:** Stüve-Wiedemann syndrome is a congenital disorder marked by bowed long bones, joint contractures, autonomic dysfunction causing temperature instability and feeding\/breathing difficulties, and distinctive facial features.

The most prevalent symptoms include:\n\n**Developmental and Cognitive Features**\nModerate-to-severe intellectual disability and global developmental delay are hallmark features[1][7]. Children typically experience delays in reaching developmental milestones, with walking often delayed until between ages 2-5 and speech development taking longer than average[1][5].\n\n**Physical and Structural Features**\nMicrocephaly (small head size) develops postnatally and continues into adulthood[5]. Hypotonia (low muscle tone) is present from infancy and results in difficulties with balance and coordination[1]. Joint hypermobility causes loose, flexible joints with an abnormally large range of motion[5].\n\n**Facial Characteristics**\nDistinctive facial features typically become apparent around age 5 and become more evident between ages 7-14[2]. These include thick hair and eyebrows, long eyelashes, down-slanting palpebral fissures, a short philtrum, prominent upper central incisors, a bulbous nasal tip, and a characteristic open-mouth appearance[8].\n\n**Metabolic and Growth Features**\nTruncal obesity develops from mid-childhood onward, particularly around the torso, while arms and legs remain relatively slender[8]. Short stature is common, and many individuals have narrow hands and feet[1][5].\n\n**Visual Problems**\nNearly all children with Cohen syndrome develop progressive visual impairment[1]. Early-onset myopia (nearsightedness) begins during the preschool years and worsens throughout childhood[1]. Retinal dystrophy causes progressive deterioration of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, leading to poor vision in dim light, tunnel vision, and loss of peripheral vision[1][2].\n\n**Hematological Features**\nNeutropenia (low number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell) is a consistent feature that may predispose individuals to slightly increased risk of dental and skin infections, though severe infections are rare[1].\n\n**Behavioral and Social Characteristics**\nChildren with Cohen syndrome are typically very sociable, affectionate, and have a cheerful disposition, though a small percentage may exhibit behavioral difficulties within the autistic spectrum[1][2].\n\n**Neonatal Presentation**\nNewborns commonly experience feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and may require nasogastric tube feeding[1]. Some infants have stridor (noisy breathing) due to a floppy windpipe[1].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nWhile Cohen syndrome presents with consistent core features, several less common symptoms occur in some individuals[5]:\n\n**Autoimmune Conditions**\nAutoimmune disorders have been reported in some individuals, including diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, and coeliac disease[1].\n\n**Oral and Dental Features**\nAphthous ulcers (canker sores) are present in some patients[2]. A high-arched or wave-shaped palate with overcrowding of teeth is common, and some individuals may have macrodontia (abnormally large teeth)[3].\n\n**Respiratory and Feeding Issues**\nRecurrent upper respiratory infections occur in certain patients, possibly related to neutropenia[2]. Failure to thrive during infancy is documented in some cases[3].\n\n**Skeletal and Limb Variations**\nArachnodactyly (abnormally long, slender fingers and toes), clinodactyly (curved fingers), cubitus valgus (increased carrying angle of the elbow), genu valgum (knock-knees), and syndactyly (webbing between fingers or toes) have been observed[3].\n\n**Other Uncommon Features**\nAdditional rarely reported symptoms include abnormal skin pigmentation, cat cry, delayed puberty, decreased fetal movement, intrauterine growth retardation, micrognathia (small jaw), neurological speech impairment, and a weak or high-pitched cry in newborns[3][5].\n\n## Gender and Age Group Susceptibility\n\n**Gender Distribution**\nCohen syndrome affects males and females in approximately equal numbers, with no significant gender predilection[5].\n\n**Age of Onset and Progression**\nCohen syndrome is a congenital condition present from birth, though characteristic features develop progressively over time. Newborns typically appear relatively normal at birth, with characteristic facial features not yet evident, though neutropenia may be present[2]. The first manifestations include feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and developmental delays during infancy[2].\n\nCharacteristic facial features start to appear around age 5 and become more evident between ages 7-14 and into adulthood[2]. Truncal obesity typically develops from mid-childhood onward, becoming more pronounced in the teen years[1][2]. Visual problems progress with age, with nyctalopia (night blindness) and narrowed visual fields developing over time, and vision progressively deteriorating after age 30[2]. By adulthood, many individuals are registered as partially-sighted or blind[1].\n\n**Population-Specific Prevalence**\nWhile Cohen syndrome affects all populations, it is overrepresented in specific ethnic and geographic groups[2]. The condition appears more frequently in people of Finnish, Amish, Greek\/Mediterranean, and Irish ancestry[5]. It is particularly prevalent among Irish travelers, with an estimated prevalence of 0.5 per 1,000 children in this population[4]. The Finnish population also shows elevated prevalence due to founder effects with specific mutations[4].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target diseases.

Failure to thrive during infancy is documented in some cases[3].\n\n**Skeletal and Limb Variations**\nArachnodactyly (abnormally long, slender fingers and toes), clinodactyly (curved fingers), cubitus valgus (increased carrying angle of the elbow), genu valgum (knock-knees), and syndactyly (webbing between fingers or toes) have been observed[3].\n\n**Other Uncommon Features**\nAdditional rarely reported symptoms include abnormal skin pigmentation, cat cry, delayed puberty, decreased fetal movement, intrauterine growth retardation, micrognathia (small jaw), neurological speech impairment, and a weak or high-pitched cry in newborns[3][5].\n\n## Gender and Age Group Susceptibility\n\n**Gender Distribution**\nCohen syndrome affects males and females in approximately equal numbers, with no significant gender predilection[5].\n\n**Age of Onset and Progression**\nCohen syndrome is a congenital condition present from birth, though characteristic features develop progressively over time. Newborns typically appear relatively normal at birth, with characteristic facial features not yet evident, though neutropenia may be present[2]. The first manifestations include feeding difficulties, hypotonia, and developmental delays during infancy[2].\n\nCharacteristic facial features start to appear around age 5 and become more evident between ages 7-14 and into adulthood[2]. Truncal obesity typically develops from mid-childhood onward, becoming more pronounced in the teen years[1][2]. Visual problems progress with age, with nyctalopia (night blindness) and narrowed visual fields developing over time, and vision progressively deteriorating after age 30[2]. By adulthood, many individuals are registered as partially-sighted or blind[1].\n\n**Population-Specific Prevalence**\nWhile Cohen syndrome affects all populations, it is overrepresented in specific ethnic and geographic groups[2]. The condition appears more frequently in people of Finnish, Amish, Greek\/Mediterranean, and Irish ancestry[5]. It is particularly prevalent among Irish travelers, with an estimated prevalence of 0.5 per 1,000 children in this population[4]. The Finnish population also shows elevated prevalence due to founder effects with specific mutations[4].\n<\/disease_info>\n\nFor this sample, you need to create a fake profile of the patient and their symptoms!\nSince its an exam, while the symptoms should be as sufficient enough to make a diagnosis, it shouldn't be so obvious!\nAdditionally, if these diseases are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\nIn your fake profile, you can add short familial history in your symptom list especially when the inheritance is important for the disease's context.\n\nFor blurring the symptoms, you can use the following tricks:\n1.

Approximately 400 people worldwide have been diagnosed with this condition, though this number is growing rapidly[7].\n\n## General and Common Symptoms\n\n**Neurodevelopmental Features**\n\nThe most prevalent symptoms involve developmental and intellectual challenges. Developmental delay occurs in 85-96% of individuals[1][3], while intellectual disability is present in 91% of cases[3]. However, the intellectual disability is typically **mild in nature**, with only a small percentage presenting with IQ below 50[3]. Individuals generally demonstrate better verbal performance than overall IQ scores, creating a notable gap between verbal and performance abilities[3][7].\n\n**Behavioral and Psychological Issues**\n\nBehavioral problems are striking and profound characteristics of the syndrome[7]. The most common behavioral conditions include[1]:\n\n- Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): 51.1% of individuals\n- Anxiety: 46.8%\n- Depression: 27.7% (significantly more common in individuals over 12 years old)\n- Autism spectrum disorder (ASD): 29.8%\n- Sleep difficulties: 42.6%\n\nAdditional behavioral manifestations include rebellious behavior, sometimes verbally aggressive outbursts, sensory processing disorder, impulse control problems, and aggressive tantrums[2][7].\n\n**Physical and Medical Features**\n\nCommon physical characteristics include[1][2][5]:\n\n- Hypotonia (low muscle tone): present in approximately 46% of individuals\n- Obesity or overweight status: approximately 63% of individuals\n- Vision or eye problems: 69% of individuals\n- Fatigue: over 50% of individuals\n- Constipation: frequently reported\n- Gastrointestinal reflux\n- Neonatal feeding difficulties\n\n**Dysmorphic Facial Features**\n\nRecognizable facial characteristics include[3][4][7]:\n\n- Large ears and fleshy earlobes\n- Prominent or almost fused eyebrows (synophris)\n- Upturned nose (anteverted nares)\n- Epicanthal folds (creases at the eyes)\n- Tapered fingers\n- Curved little finger (clinodactyly)\n- Possible fusion of skin between second and third toe (cutaneous syndactyly)\n- Light brown spots on skin (café au lait spots)\n\n**Adaptive Functioning**\n\nIndividuals typically show moderately low adaptive functioning across multiple domains, with adaptive behavior composite scores averaging 76.8[1]. All subdomains are approximately equally affected: communication, daily living skills, socialization, and motor skills[1].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\n**Developmental Regression**\n\nNotably, developmental regression has **not been reported** in individuals with PHIP variants, distinguishing this condition from many other neurodevelopmental disorders[1].\n\n**Late-Onset Developmental Delay**\n\nWhile most developmental delays manifest early, one documented case presented with normal development until age 3 years, followed by delayed psychomotor development thereafter[3][4]. This reveals that early developmental milestones are not always disrupted in all cases[3].\n\n**Neonatal Issues**\n\nSome neonatal complications occur but are relatively uncommon, including[2]:\n\n- Neonatal jaundice: 30% of cases\n- Premature birth: reported in one case\n- Various minor prenatal issues: reported in 50% of cases\n\n**Joint and Muscle Issues**\n\nHypermobile joints and easy fatigability are reported but not universally present[2].\n\n**Recurrent Infections**\n\nMinor recurrent infections have been documented in some individuals[2].\n\n## Gender and Age-Related Patterns\n\n**Gender Distribution**\n\nThe syndrome affects both males and females equally, with no gender predilection noted in the research. Studies report relatively equal numbers of affected males and females[2].\n\n**Age-Related Differences**\n\nAge significantly influences the presentation and severity of certain symptoms[1]:\n\n- **Depression**: Significantly more prevalent in individuals over 12 years old compared to younger children\n- **Socialization difficulties**: Individuals 12 years and older show significantly lower socialization scores on adaptive behavior assessments compared to younger children (mean score 69.4 vs. 84.0)\n- **Obesity**: Weight gain tends to increase with puberty, with obesity becoming more pronounced in adolescence and adulthood. The average age of obese\/overweight individuals in previous studies was 20.8 years, suggesting obesity becomes more significant with age[2]\n- **ADHD, anxiety, and sleep difficulties**: No significant age-related differences were observed in the frequency of these conditions[1]\n\n**Inheritance Pattern**\n\nWhile most cases result from de novo mutations, some individuals inherit the condition from mildly affected parents, indicating variable expressivity[3]. The fact that some parents were only diagnosed as mildly affected after their children's diagnosis underscores the phenotypic variability of the condition[3].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target diseases.

Approximately 400 people worldwide have been diagnosed with this condition, though this number is growing rapidly[7].\n\n## General and Common Symptoms\n\n**Neurodevelopmental Features**\n\nThe most prevalent symptoms involve developmental and intellectual challenges. Developmental delay occurs in 85-96% of individuals[1][3], while intellectual disability is present in 91% of cases[3]. However, the intellectual disability is typically **mild in nature**, with only a small percentage presenting with IQ below 50[3]. Individuals generally demonstrate better verbal performance than overall IQ scores, creating a notable gap between verbal and performance abilities[3][7].\n\n**Behavioral and Psychological Issues**\n\nBehavioral problems are striking and profound characteristics of the syndrome[7]. The most common behavioral conditions include[1]:\n\n- Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): 51.1% of individuals\n- Anxiety: 46.8%\n- Depression: 27.7% (significantly more common in individuals over 12 years old)\n- Autism spectrum disorder (ASD): 29.8%\n- Sleep difficulties: 42.6%\n\nAdditional behavioral manifestations include rebellious behavior, sometimes verbally aggressive outbursts, sensory processing disorder, impulse control problems, and aggressive tantrums[2][7].\n\n**Physical and Medical Features**\n\nCommon physical characteristics include[1][2][5]:\n\n- Hypotonia (low muscle tone): present in approximately 46% of individuals\n- Obesity or overweight status: approximately 63% of individuals\n- Vision or eye problems: 69% of individuals\n- Fatigue: over 50% of individuals\n- Constipation: frequently reported\n- Gastrointestinal reflux\n- Neonatal feeding difficulties\n\n**Dysmorphic Facial Features**\n\nRecognizable facial characteristics include[3][4][7]:\n\n- Large ears and fleshy earlobes\n- Prominent or almost fused eyebrows (synophris)\n- Upturned nose (anteverted nares)\n- Epicanthal folds (creases at the eyes)\n- Tapered fingers\n- Curved little finger (clinodactyly)\n- Possible fusion of skin between second and third toe (cutaneous syndactyly)\n- Light brown spots on skin (café au lait spots)\n\n**Adaptive Functioning**\n\nIndividuals typically show moderately low adaptive functioning across multiple domains, with adaptive behavior composite scores averaging 76.8[1].

Testosterone levels also influence male risk[6]. |\n| **Sex-specific Risk Factors** | Women have unique risk factors including pregnancy-related complications, early menarche\/menopause, and autoimmune disorders[8][12]. |\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Common symptoms** of cardiovascular phenotypes include chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, palpitations, and swelling.\n- **Uncommon symptoms** may include atypical chest pain (especially in women), isolated hypertension with vascular stiffness, and subclinical imaging findings.\n- **Age and gender** strongly influence cardiovascular phenotypes: men generally develop CVD earlier, women catch up post-menopause, and women have distinct risk factors related to reproductive health and pregnancy.\n\nThis comprehensive understanding helps tailor diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment strategies for cardiovascular diseases across different populations[1][2][3][5][6][8][10][12].\n<\/disease_info>\n\nFor this sample, you need to create a fake profile of the patient and their symptoms!\nSince its an exam, while the symptoms should be as sufficient enough to make a diagnosis, it shouldn't be so obvious!\nAdditionally, if these diseases are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\nIn your fake profile, you can add short familial history in your symptom list especially when the inheritance is important for the disease's context.\n\nFor blurring the symptoms, you can use the following tricks:\n1.

These typically develop in childhood and are commonly found on the knees, elbows, Achilles tendons, buttocks, and hips[1][5][7].\n\n**Elevated plant sterol levels in the blood** are a universal feature of the disease, with sitosterol levels reaching 30-100 times higher than normal[5][7]. Most patients also develop **hypercholesterolemia** (high cholesterol levels), though some individuals may have normal cholesterol despite elevated plant sterols[1][7].\n\n**Premature atherosclerosis** is another common manifestation, with fatty deposits accumulating in arteries as early as childhood[7]. This can lead to serious cardiovascular complications including heart attacks, strokes, or sudden death if left untreated[5][7].\n\n**Joint stiffness and pain** resulting from plant sterol deposits in joints occur in a significant portion of patients[1][5][7]. Additionally, **blood abnormalities** are frequently observed, with studies showing that 83% of identified sitosterolemia patients presented hematologic abnormalities[2].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nSeveral less common manifestations of sitosterolemia have been documented. **Hemolytic anemia** (premature breakdown of red blood cells) occurs in some patients, though it is not universal[1][5][7]. Related to this, **abnormally shaped red blood cells called stomatocytes** may develop[5][7].\n\n**Macrothrombocytopenia** (abnormally large platelets) and **thrombocytopenia** (low platelet count) represent additional hematologic abnormalities that occur less frequently[1][5][7]. In rare cases, **splenomegaly** (enlarged spleen) has been reported[1][5].\n\n**Liver involvement** is particularly uncommon, with one documented case initially presenting with cirrhosis[1]. **Xanthelasma** (xanthomas around the eyes) and **corneal arcus** are also less frequently observed[1].\n\nIt is important to note that some patients may present with **only blood abnormalities as their sole clinical feature**, with no other obvious symptoms[5][6].\n\n## Gender and Age Susceptibility\n\nSitosterolemia shows **no significant gender predisposition**. Among identified cases, approximately 50% were female and 50% were male[2]. The condition affects both sexes equally.\n\nRegarding age, sitosterolemia can manifest at any point in life, though it typically appears **early in childhood after plant sterol-containing foods are introduced to the diet**[7]. The median age at diagnosis in pediatric cohorts was 1.2 years, with cases reported as early as 3-4 months of age[8][12]. However, the condition is often diagnosed much later in life due to underdiagnosis, with mean ages of identified cases in some studies reaching 37.2 years[2]. The disease is **autosomal recessive**, meaning affected individuals must inherit two mutated copies of the *ABCG5* or *ABCG8* genes—one from each parent[1][11].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target diseases.

Is there a specific gender or age group that is more likely to get the disease?\n- **Age group:** The disease usually presents in infancy, most commonly within the first few days or months of life. However, symptoms can occasionally appear later in childhood or even adulthood, though this is less common.\n- **Gender:** There is no significant gender predilection; both males and females are affected equally.\n- **Genetic background:** The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, meaning both parents must be carriers. It is more common in populations with a higher rate of consanguineous marriages.\n<\/disease_info>\n\nFor this sample, you need to create a fake profile of the patient and their symptoms!\nSince its an exam, while the symptoms should be as sufficient enough to make a diagnosis, it shouldn't be so obvious!\nAdditionally, if these diseases are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\nIn your fake profile, you can add short familial history in your symptom list especially when the inheritance is important for the disease's context.\n\nFor blurring the symptoms, you can use the following tricks:\n1.

Approximately 66% of people with Fabry experience pain episodes that can last from minutes to days, sometimes called \"pain crises\"[1].\n\n**Impaired sweating** is another early and common symptom, with many people either perspiring very little (hypohidrosis) or not at all (anhidrosis)[5]. This can lead to overheating, frequent fevers, and sensitivity to temperature extremes[2]. Impaired sweating, along with pain in the hands and feet, is often one of the earliest signs in childhood[5].\n\n**Skin lesions** called angiokeratomas—small, dark red or purple spots—commonly appear between the belly button and upper thighs, though they can also develop on the buttocks, groin, elbows, and knees[2][7]. These lesions typically do not cause pain[7].\n\n**Eye abnormalities** are also common, with over 70% of males and females developing corneal whorling, a distinctive starburst pattern on the cornea that can be detected through slit-lamp examination[5].

The disease affects approximately **1 in 1,000 to 1 in 40,000 males** worldwide, depending on the disease type[6]. The classic form is rarer, affecting about 1 in 22,000 to 40,000 men, while the late-onset form is more common, affecting about 1 in 1,000 to 3,000 men[6].\n\nWomen can also develop the disease but are less frequently diagnosed due to the X-linked inheritance pattern[6]. Women have two X chromosomes, so a healthy copy can sometimes compensate for a mutated copy, leading to underreporting of prevalence among females[6]. The late-onset form affects approximately 1 in 6,000 to 40,000 women[6].\n\n**Age of onset** varies by disease type. The classic form typically appears in **childhood or adolescence**, with symptoms often beginning around age 10[3]. The late-onset form develops after **age 30**[6]. Early symptoms in children commonly include pain, skin rashes, diarrhea, constipation, and eye problems[12].\n\nRegarding life expectancy, males with Fabry disease have a median life expectancy of approximately **58.2 years**, compared to 74.7 years in the general U.S. population[3]. Females with Fabry disease have a median life expectancy of approximately **75.4 years**, compared to 80.0 years in the general population[3].

This pain is typically described as \"burning,\" \"stabbing,\" or \"tingling\" and can be triggered by physical activity or temperature changes[1]. Approximately 66% of people with Fabry experience pain episodes that can last from minutes to days, sometimes called \"pain crises\"[1].\n\n**Impaired sweating** is another early and common symptom, with many people either perspiring very little (hypohidrosis) or not at all (anhidrosis)[5]. This can lead to overheating, frequent fevers, and sensitivity to temperature extremes[2]. Impaired sweating, along with pain in the hands and feet, is often one of the earliest signs in childhood[5].\n\n**Skin lesions** called angiokeratomas—small, dark red or purple spots—commonly appear between the belly button and upper thighs, though they can also develop on the buttocks, groin, elbows, and knees[2][7].

The most distinctive and recognizable sign is **a sweet, maple syrup-like odor** in the urine, sweat, and earwax, which can be detected within the first day or two of birth[5]. This occurs due to the accumulation of branched-chain ketoacids in the body.\n\nIn infants with classic MSUD, the most common initial symptoms include **poor feeding, vomiting, and irritability**[1][9]. Affected newborns often display **lethargy and low energy levels**, appearing very sleepy[7]. As the disease progresses, infants develop **abnormal or spastic movements and muscle tightness (hypertonia)**[1][7]. **Seizures** are also a frequent complication[1][5].\n\nAdditional common symptoms include **developmental delays, trouble growing and gaining weight, and poor intellectual progress**[7][13]. Children may experience **high-pitched crying** and show signs of increasing neurological dysfunction[7].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nWhile less frequently reported, MSUD can cause several less common complications. These include **loss of bone mass and increased fractures**, as well as **pancreatic inflammation**[1]. Some affected individuals experience **headaches, nausea, and behavioral issues** such as attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety, and impulsiveness[1][2].\n\n**Intellectual disabilities or limitations** can develop, though these are more accurately described as common long-term consequences rather than acute symptoms[1]. **Impaired coordination (ataxia)** may also occur in some cases[5].\n\n## Age and Gender Distribution\n\nMSUD is not gender-specific, affecting both males and females equally[4][6]. However, the disease shows a strong **age-related pattern of onset** depending on the type:\n\n**Classic MSUD** (the most severe form) manifests within the **first few days to weeks of life**, typically within the first 24-48 hours[5][9]. Symptoms emerge very early because there is little or no enzyme activity.\n\n**Intermediate MSUD** presents later, with most children diagnosed between **5 months and 7 years of age**[1][5]. This form has greater residual enzyme activity, allowing for a delayed onset.\n\n**Intermittent MSUD** typically shows **normal growth and intellectual development during infancy and childhood**, with symptoms appearing during periods of physical stress such as illness[1][15].\n\nThe overall incidence of MSUD is approximately **1 in 185,000 to 198,000 births** in the United States[2][10][12], though it is considerably higher in specific populations such as Old Order Mennonite communities (1 in 358) and Ashkenazi Jewish populations (1 in 26,000)[2].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target diseases.

Severity varies by type: Type 1 has profound congenital deafness, Type 2 has moderate to severe congenital hearing loss, and Type 3 has progressive hearing loss starting later in life.\n   - **Vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa (RP):** This causes progressive degeneration of the retina, leading to night blindness, loss of peripheral (side) vision, and eventually tunnel vision and central vision loss.

This includes both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss[1].\n\n**Skeletal abnormalities** are extremely common, affecting 92% of adult patients and 62% of pediatric patients, manifesting as joint contractures, scoliosis, knock knees, and hip dysplasia[7]. **Immunodeficiency** leads to recurrent infections, particularly during the first decade of life, with upper airway, pulmonary, and middle ear infections being most common[1][2].\n\n**Motor and developmental delays** include difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia), muscle weakness, and delayed development of motor skills such as sitting and walking[1]. **Speech impairments** and delayed speech development are also typical[1].\n\nAdditional common features include **skeletal deformities** such as reduced bone density, thickening of skull bones, and spinal deformations; **eye problems** including cataracts and corneal clouding; and **dental problems** with reduced dental quality and frequent cavities[1][7].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nWhile less frequent, several notable manifestations occur in specific patient populations. **Psychiatric symptoms** affect approximately 25% or more of untreated patients and nearly half of those affected overall, including depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and confusion[1][3][10]. These psychiatric episodes may be triggered by stressors such as surgery, emotional upset, or changes in routine[1].\n\n**Hydrocephalus** (fluid buildup in the brain) may develop in the first year of life in some infants[1][3]. **Hepatosplenomegaly** (enlargement of liver and spleen) occurs in some patients[1].\n\n**Cardiovascular abnormalities** are relatively uncommon, present in 24% of pediatric patients and 17% of adult patients[7]. **Pulmonary function decline** occurs in younger patients over time[7]. **Retinal pigmentary degeneration** leading to partial blindness is documented but less common[7].\n\nSome infants are born with **ankle equinus** (abnormally twisted ankle), a congenital presentation[1][3].\n\n## Gender and Age Susceptibility\n\nAlpha-mannosidosis shows **no gender predilection**—it affects males and females equally[2]. The disease is inherited in an **autosomal recessive pattern**, meaning both males and females have equal probability of inheriting the condition when both parents are carriers[5].\n\nRegarding age groups, alpha-mannosidosis presents across a **wide spectrum of onset and severity**[3].

The symptoms, rarity, and affected populations vary significantly depending on the specific disease.\n\nHere is a synthesis of the most relevant information about general and rare symptoms, and demographics for several notable inborn genetic diseases:\n\n---\n\n### 1. **General\/Common Symptoms of Inborn Genetic Diseases**\n\n- **Neurological symptoms:** Movement abnormalities (tremors, ataxia, dystonia, chorea), muscle weakness, coordination and balance issues, cognitive decline, developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, sensory impairments (vision, hearing), and behavioral or psychiatric changes such as anxiety or depression[1][8].\n- **Physical abnormalities:** Unusual facial features, joint problems, skin or tissue malformations, heart defects, and growth delays[2][3][4].\n- **Metabolic symptoms:** Failure to break down certain substances leading to accumulation (e.g., phenylketonuria causing intellectual and physical developmental delay)[2][5].\n- **Blood-related symptoms:** Anemia, clotting abnormalities, or malformed blood cells (e.g., sickle cell disease)[2].\n- **Other systemic symptoms:** Excessive sweating, trouble feeding, poor weight gain, cyanosis (bluish skin tint), and gastrointestinal issues[3].\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Rare\/Uncommon Symptoms**\n\n- **Specific tissue deterioration:** For example, Parry Romberg syndrome causes gradual deterioration of skin and tissues on half the face[2].\n- **Arteriovenous malformations:** Abnormal blood vessel connections causing seizures, intellectual disabilities, or glaucoma (e.g., Parkes Weber syndrome, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia)[2][3].\n- **Rare enzyme deficiencies:** Leading to unique metabolic crises or organ damage (e.g., alpha-glucosidase deficiency in Pompe disease)[2][5].\n- **Rare chromosomal abnormalities:** Such as trisomy 13 causing a combination of intellectual disability, heart defects, cleft palate, and spine abnormalities[2].\n- **Rare behavioral syndromes:** Such as Prader-Willi syndrome causing insatiable appetite or Rett syndrome causing progressive intellectual and physical disability[4].\n- **Rare sensory abnormalities:** Heightened or reduced sensitivity to stimuli like light, sound, touch, or taste[1].\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Gender or Age Group Predispositions**\n\n- **Age group:** Many inborn genetic diseases manifest symptoms from birth or early childhood (e.g., Stickler syndrome, phenylketonuria, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome), although some neurological symptoms may not appear until adulthood (e.g., Huntington’s disease)[1][2][3][4][8].\n- **Gender specificity:** Some disorders are sex chromosome linked, affecting one gender more:\n  - **Klinefelter syndrome (XXY):** Affects males, causing small genitals and infertility[4].\n  - **Turner syndrome:** Affects females due to missing or partially missing X chromosome[4].\n- **No specific gender bias:** Many autosomal disorders affect males and females equally (e.g., sickle cell disease, Marfan syndrome, Noonan syndrome)[2][4].\n\n---\n\n### Examples of Specific Diseases with Symptoms and Demographics\n\n| Disease                     | Common Symptoms                                   | Rare Symptoms                                     | Gender\/Age Predisposition                         |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Phenylketonuria (PKU)**   | Delayed physical and intellectual development   | Severe neurological damage if untreated          | Presents in infancy;

This manifests as an abnormal white reflection from the retina, where the pupil appears white instead of the normal red reflex when light shines into the eye[1][8]. Parents frequently notice this white glare in flash photography, sometimes described as a \"cat's eye reflex\"[7].\n\n**Strabismus** (crossed eyes or lazy eye) is the second most common symptom[7]. In this condition, the eyes do not align properly and appear to look in different directions, with one eye potentially turning toward the nose or ear[7][10].\n\nAdditional common symptoms include[2][4][10]:\n- Changes in eye movement or how the eyes look\n- Vision loss or poor vision\n- Eye redness or swelling\n- Watery or teary eyes\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nLess common symptoms typically appear when the cancer is more advanced[2][4]. These include:\n\n- Pain, redness, or significant swelling of one or both eyes\n- Bulging of the eye (exophthalmos)[5]\n- Enlarged or dilated pupil[7]\n- Different colored irises (heterochromia)[5][7]\n- Repetitive, uncontrolled eye movements (nystagmus)[5]\n- Differences in pupil size (anisocoria)[5]\n- Vitreous hemorrhage (leakage of blood near the vitreous)[5]\n- Hyphema (pooling of blood in the space between the cornea and iris)[5]\n- Clouding of the lenses (cataract)[5]\n- Glaucoma (elevated fluid pressure within the eye)[5]\n\nWhen retinoblastoma has spread to other areas of the body, additional symptoms may develop[2][4]:\n- Loss of appetite\n- Weight loss\n- Vomiting\n- Headache\n- Neurologic problems such as weakness, numbness, and trouble with movement\n- Lumps or masses\n\n## Age and Gender Patterns\n\n**Age Distribution**: Retinoblastoma predominantly affects very young children. Two out of three cases are diagnosed in children younger than 2 years of age, and almost all cases are diagnosed before age 5[6]. Symptoms typically develop before age 2 or 3[13][16].\n\n**Gender Predilection**: Research on a global sample of 4,351 treatment-naive retinoblastoma patients from 153 countries found that while the overall male-to-female ratio was 1.20 compared to the global sex ratio at birth of 1.07, this difference was not indicative of true biological sex predilection[3]. The higher male ratio observed in certain regions, particularly in Asian countries and India, is likely due to gender discrimination in access to care rather than inherent biological differences between sexes[3].

The most common manifestations include:\n\n**Lower limb involvement**: A gradual weakness in the legs combined with increased muscle tone and stiffness (spasticity) characterizes the condition[1]. People develop a distinctive \"spastic gait\" where they tend to walk on their tiptoes with feet turned inward, often causing shoes to wear down over the big toe area[5][11].\n\n**Mobility challenges**: Walking becomes progressively more difficult, with individuals experiencing stumbling, tripping (particularly on uneven ground), and reduced stride length[1][11]. The spasticity primarily affects muscles of leg extension, knee flexion, hip adduction, and foot extension muscles[11].\n\n**Urinary dysfunction**: Bladder problems are relatively common, with urgency being an early symptom—people may feel an urgent need to urinate even when the bladder is not full[1][5].\n\n**Exaggerated reflexes and muscle activity**: People develop exaggerated reflexes, leg cramps, twitches, and spasms that make leg movements stiff and jerky[5]. Fatigue is also commonly reported[5].\n\n**Sensory changes**: While sensation is usually largely preserved, some people experience a subtle loss of the ability to feel vibrations in the legs and feet[5]. A lack of sensation in the feet may occur in some cases[1].\n\nAbout 90% of people with HSP have the \"pure form\" where symptoms are mainly confined to lower limb weakness and spasticity[1][3].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nThe remaining 10% of people with HSP have a \"complicated\" or \"complex form\" with additional symptoms beyond the typical leg weakness and spasticity[1][3]. These rare manifestations include:\n\n**Neurological complications**: Peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the feet or other extremities), epilepsy, and problems with balance, coordination, and speech (ataxia) can occur[1][3].\n\n**Ocular problems**: Eye damage including retinopathy (damage to the retina) and optic neuropathy (damage to the optic nerve) have been documented[1][3].\n\n**Cognitive and developmental issues**: Dementia, intellectual disability, and learning and developmental problems may develop in some patients[1][3].\n\n**Skin conditions**: Ichthyosis—a condition causing widespread and persistent thick, dry \"fish-scale\" skin—can accompany HSP[1][3].\n\n**Other complications**: Hearing loss, speech, breathing, or swallowing problems may also occur in the complex form[1][3].\n\n**Upper limb involvement**: In some people, muscles in the arms also become weak and stiff, though this is less common than lower limb involvement[5].\n\n## Gender and Age Distribution\n\n**Gender**: Hereditary spastic paraplegia affects both sexes relatively equally[5][7]. Research shows no significant gender differences in overall prevalence, though some specific genetic subtypes show gender variations—for example, SPG7-HSP has a markedly high male proportion (90%) and REEP1-HSP shows 78% male predominance[8].\n\n**Age of onset**: Symptoms may begin at any age, ranging from infancy to old age, depending on the specific form of the disease[5][7][10]. The mean age at onset varies by subtype, with studies showing an average onset around 24 years in population-based research[4]. Some forms typically present between ages 1 and 5 years[9], while others may not manifest until the teenage years or later[10]. When symptoms begin during the teenage years or later, the progression tends to be slower[10].\n\n**Prevalence**: The condition affects approximately 1 to 10 of every 100,000 people[5][7]. Population studies have estimated prevalence at 7.4 per 100,000, with the mean age on prevalence day being 48 years[4].\n\n**Progression**: While symptoms usually continue to slowly worsen over time, they sometimes level off after adolescence[5][7]. Importantly, life span is not affected by the condition[5][7].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target diseases.

General \/ Common Symptoms\n\n- **Increased risk of multiple types of cancer:** Individuals often develop cancers associated with the specific syndrome, frequently at younger ages than typical[1][3][5][7].\n- **Multiple primary cancers:** Some syndromes predispose to more than one independent cancer in the same individual[7].\n- **Family history of cancer:** A strong family history of related cancers, often occurring before age 50, is common[1][7].\n- **Specific cancers vary by syndrome:**\n\n  - *Lynch syndrome* (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer): Early-onset colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and increased risks of stomach, ovarian, pancreatic, urinary tract, brain, small bowel, gallbladder, bile duct, and skin cancers[1][5][6].\n  \n  - *Li-Fraumeni syndrome*: Early onset of breast cancer (especially female), sarcomas of bone and soft tissue, brain tumors, adrenal gland cancers, and multiple cancers over a lifetime[3][5][11].\n  \n  - *Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome*: Breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal cancers in females; breast and prostate cancer in males; also increased pancreatic cancer and melanoma risk[5].\n  \n  - *Cowden syndrome*: Benign and malignant tumors of breast, thyroid, endometrium; macrocephaly; characteristic skin lesions[9].\n  \n  - *Peutz-Jeghers syndrome*: Gastrointestinal polyps, mucocutaneous pigmentation, increased risk of colon, stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, uterine, ovarian, cervical, and testicular cancers[9].\n  \n- **Early age of onset:** Many hereditary cancer syndromes cause cancers to appear decades earlier than sporadic cases, often before age 50[1][2][3][6].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms\n\n- **Non-cancerous manifestations:** Some syndromes have characteristic benign features, e.g., Cowden syndrome’s papillomatous papules and macrocephaly[9].\n- **Rare cancers:** Some syndromes predispose to rare cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, medullary thyroid cancer, paraganglioma, pheochromocytoma, and sebaceous carcinoma[7].\n- **Sex-limited traits:** For example, Lynch syndrome with *MSH6* mutations shows high cancer risk predominantly in females, with males having lower penetrance[4].\n- **Multiple independent primary tumors:** Development of several distinct cancers in one individual is less common but characteristic of syndromes like Li-Fraumeni[3][7].\n- **Cutaneous signs:** Some syndromes present with skin manifestations, e.g., mucocutaneous pigmentation in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome or skin cancers in Lynch syndrome[1][5][7].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Specific Gender or Age Group Predilection\n\n- **Age:** Most hereditary cancer syndromes manifest cancers earlier than the general population, often before age 50, but some syndromes or gene variants show later onset (e.g., *PMS2* mutations in Lynch syndrome show little increased risk before 50)[1][2][4][6].\n- **Gender differences:**\n\n  - *Lynch syndrome*: Females have higher risk of gynecological cancers (endometrial, ovarian), males may have higher risk of prostate, stomach, and small bowel cancers[1][4][5][6].\n  \n  - *HBOC syndrome*: Females have high breast and ovarian cancer risk; males have increased prostate and breast cancer risk[5].\n  \n  - *Li-Fraumeni syndrome*: Affects both genders; however, female breast cancer is a common early cancer[3][5].\n  \n  - *Peutz-Jeghers syndrome*: Both genders affected, but males have increased testicular cancer risk; females have increased breast, uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancer risk[9].\n  \n- **Inheritance pattern:** Most hereditary cancer syndromes are autosomal dominant, meaning one mutated gene copy from a parent is sufficient to increase cancer risk[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\n**In summary**, hereditary cancer-predisposing syndromes are characterized by early-onset cancers, multiple cancer types often within families, and sometimes unique benign features or rare cancers. Gender and age of onset vary by the specific syndrome and gene involved, with some syndromes showing sex-limited cancer risks or later onset in certain gene variants[1][3][4][5][7][9].

General \/ Common Symptoms\n\n- **Increased risk of multiple types of cancer:** Individuals often develop cancers associated with the specific syndrome, frequently at younger ages than typical[1][3][5][7].\n- **Multiple primary cancers:** Some syndromes predispose to more than one independent cancer in the same individual[7].\n- **Family history of cancer:** A strong family history of related cancers, often occurring before age 50, is common[1][7].\n- **Specific cancers vary by syndrome:**\n\n  - *Lynch syndrome* (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer): Early-onset colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and increased risks of stomach, ovarian, pancreatic, urinary tract, brain, small bowel, gallbladder, bile duct, and skin cancers[1][5][6].\n  \n  - *Li-Fraumeni syndrome*: Early onset of breast cancer (especially female), sarcomas of bone and soft tissue, brain tumors, adrenal gland cancers, and multiple cancers over a lifetime[3][5][11].\n  \n  - *Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome*: Breast, ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneal cancers in females; breast and prostate cancer in males; also increased pancreatic cancer and melanoma risk[5].\n  \n  - *Cowden syndrome*: Benign and malignant tumors of breast, thyroid, endometrium; macrocephaly; characteristic skin lesions[9].\n  \n  - *Peutz-Jeghers syndrome*: Gastrointestinal polyps, mucocutaneous pigmentation, increased risk of colon, stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, uterine, ovarian, cervical, and testicular cancers[9].\n  \n- **Early age of onset:** Many hereditary cancer syndromes cause cancers to appear decades earlier than sporadic cases, often before age 50[1][2][3][6].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms\n\n- **Non-cancerous manifestations:** Some syndromes have characteristic benign features, e.g., Cowden syndrome’s papillomatous papules and macrocephaly[9].\n- **Rare cancers:** Some syndromes predispose to rare cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma, leiomyosarcoma, medullary thyroid cancer, paraganglioma, pheochromocytoma, and sebaceous carcinoma[7].\n- **Sex-limited traits:** For example, Lynch syndrome with *MSH6* mutations shows high cancer risk predominantly in females, with males having lower penetrance[4].\n- **Multiple independent primary tumors:** Development of several distinct cancers in one individual is less common but characteristic of syndromes like Li-Fraumeni[3][7].\n- **Cutaneous signs:** Some syndromes present with skin manifestations, e.g., mucocutaneous pigmentation in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome or skin cancers in Lynch syndrome[1][5][7].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Specific Gender or Age Group Predilection\n\n- **Age:** Most hereditary cancer syndromes manifest cancers earlier than the general population, often before age 50, but some syndromes or gene variants show later onset (e.g., *PMS2* mutations in Lynch syndrome show little increased risk before 50)[1][2][4][6].\n- **Gender differences:**\n\n  - *Lynch syndrome*: Females have higher risk of gynecological cancers (endometrial, ovarian), males may have higher risk of prostate, stomach, and small bowel cancers[1][4][5][6].\n  \n  - *HBOC syndrome*: Females have high breast and ovarian cancer risk; males have increased prostate and breast cancer risk[5].\n  \n  - *Li-Fraumeni syndrome*: Affects both genders; however, female breast cancer is a common early cancer[3][5].\n  \n  - *Peutz-Jeghers syndrome*: Both genders affected, but males have increased testicular cancer risk; females have increased breast, uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancer risk[9].\n  \n- **Inheritance pattern:** Most hereditary cancer syndromes are autosomal dominant, meaning one mutated gene copy from a parent is sufficient to increase cancer risk[1][3][5].\n\n---\n\n**In summary**, hereditary cancer-predisposing syndromes are characterized by early-onset cancers, multiple cancer types often within families, and sometimes unique benign features or rare cancers. Gender and age of onset vary by the specific syndrome and gene involved, with some syndromes showing sex-limited cancer risks or later onset in certain gene variants[1][3][4][5][7][9].

The most prevalent symptoms include:\n\n**Respiratory symptoms** are the hallmark of PCD. Affected individuals experience a chronic wet cough that produces sputum and persists from infancy, often lasting four weeks or longer[12]. Chronic nasal congestion with thick nasal drainage is nearly universal, occurring year-round and not resolving with seasonal changes[4]. Many patients develop recurrent or chronic bacterial infections of the lower airways, including recurring pneumonia and bronchitis[6].\n\n**Ear and hearing complications** are extremely common, affecting approximately half of all children with PCD[9]. These include recurrent middle ear infections (otitis media) and hearing loss if left untreated[5].\n\n**Newborn presentation** is distinctive, with 75% of children with PCD experiencing respiratory distress after birth[9]. Full-term newborns often require supplemental oxygen for days or weeks[6].\n\n**Progressive lung damage** develops over time, with bronchiectasis (dilation and weakening of the bronchial tubes) developing in an age-dependent manner and becoming nearly universal in adults[6].\n\n## Rare and Uncommon Symptoms\n\nSeveral less common complications can occur with PCD:\n\n**Neurological complications** are rare but documented. In uncommon cases, individuals with PCD develop hydrocephalus (accumulation of fluid in the brain), though researchers do not fully understand why this occurs in some patients[5].\n\n**Skeletal abnormalities** have been reported rarely in 5-10% of patients, including pectus excavatum (sunken chest), scoliosis, and digital clubbing (swelling at the fingertips)[6].\n\n**Organ positioning abnormalities** occur in a subset of patients. While situs inversus totalis (mirror-image reversal of organs) affects 40-50% of PCD patients and is relatively common, heterotaxy syndrome (situs ambiguous) is less frequent, occurring in approximately 9-12% of patients[5]. Heterotaxy can include serious complications such as structural congenital heart disease that may be life-threatening[7].\n\n**Fertility complications** represent another manifestation, with subfertility affecting up to 83% of affected men and up to 61% of affected women[8].\n\n## Gender and Age Patterns\n\n**Gender differences** are pronounced in PCD, particularly regarding fertility. Almost all males with PCD are infertile due to dysmotility of sperm, though a few have normal sperm motility[6]. Subfertility in men with PCD is significantly higher than in women[8]. Additionally, males with PCD may have decreased fertility due to abnormal sperm movement, while females may experience reduced fertility due to abnormal cilia in the fallopian tubes[5].\n\n**Age of onset** is typically very early. Most affected individuals develop signs of PCD at birth or within the first few months of life[6]. However, due to diagnostic challenges, some cases are not identified until adulthood[6]. The condition affects children throughout their lives, with symptoms generally beginning in infancy and progressing over time[9].\n\n**No specific age group immunity** exists—PCD is a lifelong condition that begins in infancy and continues into adulthood. The disease does not show a predilection for any particular age group beyond the early childhood presentation, as it is present from birth.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target diseases.

Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms:**\n- Paralysis of the eye muscles (ophthalmoplegia)\n- Cardiac issues (such as cor pulmonale, right ventricular enlargement or failure due to respiratory insufficiency)\n- Gastroesophageal reflux\n- Muscle exhaustion in adulthood (ages 20–50)\n- Intranuclear rods (seen in some congenital forms, not in late-onset)\n- Severe congenital form with life expectancy rarely exceeding 2 years (Amish type)\n- Adult-onset form with rapid progression (sporadic late-onset nemaline myopathy)\n\n**3. Specific Gender or Age Group More Likely to Get the Disease:**\n- Nemaline myopathy affects males and females equally.\n- The disease can present at any age, from birth to adulthood, but the most common form is congenital (onset at or shortly after birth).\n- The typical congenital form accounts for about 50% of cases and is most often diagnosed in infancy.\n- The severe congenital form is usually fatal in early childhood, while the adult-onset form is rare and typically presents between ages 20 and 50.\n- Individuals of Old Order Amish descent have a much higher incidence (1 in 500) compared to the general population (1 in 50,000).\n<\/disease_info>\n\nFor this sample, you need to create a fake profile of the patient and their symptoms!\nSince its an exam, while the symptoms should be as sufficient enough to make a diagnosis, it shouldn't be so obvious!\nAdditionally, if these diseases are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\nIn your fake profile, you can add short familial history in your symptom list especially when the inheritance is important for the disease's context.\n\nFor blurring the symptoms, you can use the following tricks:\n1.
