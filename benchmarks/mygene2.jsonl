Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"Here is an analysis of the listed HPO terms regarding their commonality, informativeness for specific diseases, and any gender or age predilections based on the provided information:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Global brain atrophy (HP:0002283)\n- **Common and less informative:** Brain atrophy is a relatively common finding in many neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, stroke, multiple sclerosis, infections, and malnutrition. It is a general sign of brain tissue loss and thus less specific for a particular disease[1][3][7][11].\n- **Rare and informative:** Specific patterns like brain hemiatrophy or focal atrophy can be more informative for particular syndromes (e.g., Sturge-Weber syndrome, tuberous sclerosis)[1].\n- **Age\/gender:** More common with aging and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's typically after age 60). Some causes like multiple sclerosis affect women more often[7][11].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Strabismus (HP:0000486)\n- **Common and less informative:** Strabismus is a common pediatric eye disorder, often idiopathic or related to refractive errors, and thus less informative alone[2][4][10].\n- **Rare and informative:** Strabismus caused by cranial nerve palsies, brain tumors, or syndromic conditions (e.g., Down syndrome, cerebral palsy) is more specific and informative[2][4].\n- **Age\/gender:** Most commonly develops in infants and young children (by age 3), but can also occur in adults due to neurological or systemic causes[2][4][10][14].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Umbilical hernia (HP:0001537)\n- **Common and less informative:** Umbilical hernias are common in infants and often benign; less specific for disease unless associated with syndromes or other anomalies.\n- **Rare and informative:** When persistent or associated with other anomalies, it may indicate connective tissue disorders or syndromic conditions.\n- **Age\/gender:** More common in infants; usually resolves spontaneously in childhood.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Dimple chin (HP:0010751)\n- **Common and less informative:** A dimpled chin is a common facial variant, usually benign and not disease-specific.\n- **Rare and informative:** Rarely informative unless part of a syndrome with multiple dysmorphic features.\n- **Age\/gender:** Present from birth; no specific gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Talipes equinovarus (clubfoot) (HP:0001762)\n- **Common and less informative:** Clubfoot is a relatively common congenital deformity, sometimes isolated and idiopathic.\n- **Rare and informative:** When associated with neuromuscular disorders or syndromes, it becomes more informative[1].\n- **Age\/gender:** Present at birth; no strong gender bias reported.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Wide nasal bridge (HP:0000431)\n- **Common and less informative:** A wide nasal bridge is a common facial feature variant.\n- **Rare and informative:** When combined with other dysmorphic features, it can be informative for genetic syndromes[4].\n- **Age\/gender:** Present from birth; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Full cheeks (HP:0000293)\n- **Common and less informative:** Full cheeks are a common facial trait, often benign.\n- **Rare and informative:** May be informative if part of a syndrome with other features.\n- **Age\/gender:** Present from birth; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 8.

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms for Disease Specificity and Clinical Relevance\n\n## Overview\n\nThe HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology) terms provided span a wide range of clinical features, from highly specific to non-specific findings. Below is a detailed analysis of each term's diagnostic utility, rarity, and demographic associations.\n\n## Gastroesophageal Reflux (HP:0002020)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nGastroesophageal reflux is a **highly common condition** affecting a significant portion of the general population[1][3]. The condition occurs when the lower esophageal sphincter fails to close properly, allowing stomach contents to leak backward into the esophagus[1]. While it causes characteristic symptoms like heartburn, this finding alone is not specific to any particular disease and can occur as a primary condition or secondary to numerous other disorders[3].\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis condition affects individuals across all age groups and genders, though it may be exacerbated during pregnancy[1]. It is particularly common in obese individuals and those with hiatal hernias[1][7].\n\n---\n\n## Knee Flexion Contracture (HP:0006380)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nKnee flexion contracture is a **more specific finding** that indicates significant underlying pathology[2][4]. This condition represents a fixed bent position of the knee that cannot be straightened actively or passively[2]. While not extremely rare, its presence is highly informative as it suggests specific etiologies such as arthritis, cerebral palsy, post-traumatic deformities, or complications following total knee replacement[6][8].\n\n**Clinical Significance:**\nThe severity of knee flexion contracture correlates with disease progression. Research indicates that for every degree of flexion contracture present, the risk of requiring knee replacement increases by 6% over three years[4]. Contractures greater than 15 degrees cause measurable biomechanical stress on the knee joint[2].\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis condition can affect individuals of various ages but is particularly common in patients with cerebral palsy, those with post-surgical complications, and elderly patients with advanced osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis[6][8].\n\n---\n\n## Delayed Speech and Language Development (HP:0000750)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nSpeech and language delay is a **relatively common developmental finding** that can result from numerous etiologies including hearing loss, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, and many genetic syndromes. While important to identify, this finding alone lacks specificity for any particular disease.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis term applies primarily to **children under five years of age**. Males are statistically more likely to experience speech delays than females, though the reasons for this sex difference remain incompletely understood.\n\n---\n\n## Micrognathia (HP:0000347)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nMicrognathia (small mandible) is a **more specific craniofacial finding** that is associated with particular genetic syndromes and conditions. This feature is particularly informative when present in combination with other findings, as it appears in conditions such as Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome, and various genetic syndromes affecting craniofacial development.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nMicrognathia is present from birth and affects both males and females equally, though certain genetic syndromes associated with micrognathia may show sex-linked inheritance patterns depending on the specific condition.\n\n---\n\n## Full Cheeks (HP:0000293)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nFull or prominent cheeks represent a **non-specific facial feature** that varies widely in the general population based on genetics, body composition, and age. While this finding can be associated with certain conditions (such as Cushing syndrome or certain genetic syndromes), it is too common and variable to be diagnostically informative on its own.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present across all age groups and genders, though it may be more prominent in children and individuals with higher body weight.\n\n---\n\n## Adducted Thumb (HP:0001181)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nAdducted thumb (thumb-in-palm deformity) is a **specific and informative finding** that is associated with particular neurological and genetic conditions. This sign is particularly notable in conditions affecting upper motor neurons and in certain genetic syndromes. The presence of bilateral adducted thumbs is especially significant and suggests specific pathology.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis finding is present from birth or early infancy and affects both sexes equally. It is more commonly associated with conditions that manifest in early childhood.\n\n---\n\n## Elbow Flexion Contracture (HP:0002987)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nElbow flexion contracture is a **specific finding** indicating fixed limitation of elbow extension. Like knee flexion contractures, this represents significant underlying pathology and is associated with conditions such as cerebral palsy, arthritis, post-traumatic deformities, and prolonged immobilization.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis condition can affect individuals of any age but is particularly common in patients with cerebral palsy and those with chronic neurological conditions.\n\n---\n\n## Global Developmental Delay (HP:0001263)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nGlobal developmental delay is a **relatively common but non-specific finding** that indicates delayed achievement of developmental milestones across multiple domains. This term applies only to children under five years of age and can result from hundreds of different etiologies, making it useful as a screening finding but not specific for any particular disease.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis term is restricted to **children younger than five years of age**. It affects both males and females, though certain genetic conditions associated with developmental delay may show sex-linked patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Motor Delay (HP:0001270)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nMotor delay is a **common developmental finding** that is less specific than global developmental delay, as it focuses only on motor skill acquisition. This can result from numerous causes including cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophies, metabolic disorders, and many genetic syndromes.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis applies to **children**, typically identified in the first few years of life. Both males and females are affected, though certain conditions associated with motor delay (such as X-linked muscular dystrophies) show sex-specific patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Seizure (HP:0001250)\n\n**Common but Moderately Informative:**\nSeizures are a **relatively common neurological manifestation** that can occur in numerous conditions including epilepsy, metabolic disorders, infections, genetic syndromes, and brain injuries. While seizures indicate significant neurological involvement, they are not specific to any particular disease.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nSeizures can occur at any age, though certain types of seizures show age-specific patterns. Some genetic epilepsies show male predominance, while others affect both sexes equally.\n\n---\n\n## Breathing Dysregulation (HP:0005957)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nBreathing dysregulation is a **specific and potentially informative finding** that suggests involvement of respiratory control centers or neuromuscular systems. This finding is particularly significant when present in combination with other neurological features.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis can occur across age groups but is particularly notable in infants and young children with neurological conditions affecting brainstem function or in patients with neuromuscular disorders.\n\n---\n\n## Cerebellar Atrophy (HP:0001272)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nCerebellar atrophy is a **specific neuroimaging finding** that indicates irreversible loss of cerebellar tissue. This is highly informative as it suggests progressive neurological disease or prior injury and is associated with specific conditions such as spinocerebellar ataxias, metabolic disorders, and chronic toxin exposure.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis can develop at any age depending on the underlying etiology, though certain hereditary cerebellar atrophies show age-dependent onset patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Hypotonia (HP:0001252)\n\n**Common and Moderately Informative:**\nHypotonia (low muscle tone) is a **relatively common finding** in infants and young children that can result from numerous causes including cerebral palsy, metabolic disorders, genetic syndromes, and neuromuscular diseases. While important to identify, it lacks specificity without additional clinical context.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nHypotonia is typically identified in **infants and young children**. It affects both males and females, though certain conditions associated with hypotonia (such as X-linked myotubular myopathy) show sex-specific patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Apnea (HP:0002104)\n\n**Moderately Common and Informative:**\nApnea (absence of breathing) is a **significant clinical finding** that indicates respiratory control abnormalities or neuromuscular dysfunction. While not extremely rare, its presence is clinically important and suggests specific pathology affecting respiratory regulation.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nApnea is particularly common in **premature infants** and those with neurological conditions. It can occur at any age but is most clinically significant in infants and young children.\n\n---\n\n## Abnormal Pattern of Respiration (HP:0002793)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nAbnormal respiratory patterns are a **relatively common finding** that can result from numerous causes including neurological disorders, metabolic conditions, and pain or anxiety. This finding is non-specific without additional characterization.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis can occur across all age groups and affects both sexes equally.\n\n---\n\n## Drooling (HP:0002307)\n\n**Common and Moderately Informative:**\nDrooling is a **relatively common finding** that indicates difficulty with saliva control, often reflecting oropharyngeal dysfunction or neurological involvement. While common in infants, persistent drooling in older children or adults suggests specific pathology.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nDrooling is normal in **infants** but becomes pathological if persistent beyond age 4-5 years. When pathological, it is associated with conditions affecting oral motor control and is common in cerebral palsy and other neurological disorders affecting both sexes.\n\n---\n\n## Talipes Equinovarus (HP:0001762)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nClubfoot (talipes equinovarus) is a **specific congenital finding** with clear diagnostic significance. While it can occur as an isolated finding, its presence is informative and may suggest underlying genetic or neuromuscular conditions.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis congenital deformity is present at birth and affects males approximately twice as frequently as females. It occurs in approximately 1 per 1,000 live births.\n\n---\n\n## Constipation (HP:0002019)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nConstipation is a **very common symptom** in the general population that can result from numerous causes including dietary factors, medications, metabolic disorders, and neurological conditions. While important to identify, it is highly non-specific.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nConstipation affects individuals across all age groups and both sexes, though it becomes increasingly common with advancing age.\n\n---\n\n## Strabismus (HP:0000486)\n\n**Common and Moderately Informative:**\nStrabismus (eye misalignment) is a **relatively common finding** affecting approximately 3-4% of the population. While it can occur as an isolated finding, it may also indicate underlying neurological or genetic conditions.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nStrabismus typically manifests in **early childhood** and affects both males and females equally. Certain genetic syndromes associated with strabismus may show sex-linked inheritance patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Enlarged Naris (HP:0009931)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nEnlarged nostrils represent a **non-specific facial feature** that varies widely in the general population. While this can be associated with certain genetic syndromes or metabolic conditions, it is too common to be diagnostically informative on its own.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present across all age groups and both sexes, with significant variation based on ethnicity and genetics.\n\n---\n\n## Long Philtrum (HP:0000343)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nA long philtrum is a **relatively common facial feature** that shows significant variation in the general population. While associated with certain genetic syndromes (such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder), it is not specific enough to be diagnostically informative without additional findings.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present across all age groups and both sexes, with variation based on ethnicity and genetics.\n\n---\n\n## Dimple Chin (HP:0010751)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nA dimpled chin is a **very common facial feature** present in a significant portion of the general population and is largely determined by genetics. This finding has minimal diagnostic significance on its own.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present across all age groups and both sexes, with significant variation based on ethnicity and family genetics.\n\n---\n\n## Camptodactyly (HP:0012385)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nCamptodactyly (permanent flexion of fingers or toes) is a **specific finding** that indicates underlying contracture or neuromuscular pathology. This is particularly informative when present bilaterally or in multiple digits and is associated with specific genetic syndromes and neuromuscular conditions.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis can be present from birth or develop during childhood. It affects both males and females, though certain genetic conditions associated with camptodactyly show sex-linked inheritance patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Wide Nasal Bridge (HP:0000431)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nA wide nasal bridge is a **common facial feature** showing significant variation in the general population. While associated with certain genetic syndromes, it is too common to be diagnostically specific on its own.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present across all age groups and both sexes, with significant variation based on ethnicity and genetics.\n\n---\n\n## Short Columella (HP:0002000)\n\n**Moderately Rare and Informative:**\nA short columella is a **more specific craniofacial finding** that, when present in combination with other features, can be informative for certain genetic syndromes and conditions affecting nasal development.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present from birth and affects both males and females equally, though certain genetic syndromes associated with short columella may show sex-linked patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table: Diagnostic Utility Classification\n\n| HPO Term | Specificity | Rarity | Primary Age Group | Gender Pattern |\n|----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Gastroesophageal reflux | Low | Common | All ages | Equal |\n| Knee flexion contracture | High | Moderate | All ages | Equal |\n| Delayed speech\/language | Low | Common | <5 years | Male predominance |\n| Micrognathia | High | Rare | Birth\/early childhood | Equal |\n| Full cheeks | Low | Very common | All ages | Equal |\n| Adducted thumb | High | Rare | Birth\/early childhood | Equal |\n| Elbow flexion contracture | High | Moderate | All ages | Equal |\n| Global developmental delay | Low | Common | <5 years | Equal |\n| Motor delay | Low | Common | Early childhood | Sex-linked variants |\n| Seizure | Moderate | Common | All ages | Condition-dependent |\n| Breathing dysregulation | High | Rare | Infants\/children | Equal |\n| Cerebellar atrophy | High | Rare | Variable | Equal |\n| Hypotonia | Moderate | Common | Infants\/children | Sex-linked variants |\n| Apnea | Moderate | Moderate | Infants\/children | Equal |\n| Abnormal respiration pattern | Low | Common | All ages | Equal |\n| Drooling | Moderate | Common | Infants\/children | Equal |\n| Talipes equinovarus | High | Rare | Birth | Male predominance (2:1) |\n| Constipation | Low | Very common | All ages | Increases with age |\n| Strabismus | Moderate | Common | Early childhood | Equal |\n| Enlarged naris | Low | Very common | All ages | Equal |\n| Long philtrum | Low | Common | All ages | Equal |\n| Dimple chin | Low | Very common | All ages | Equal |\n| Camptodactyly | High | Rare | Birth\/childhood | Sex-linked variants |\n| Wide nasal bridge | Low | Very common | All ages | Equal |\n| Short columella | Moderate | Moderate | Birth | Equal |","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Contractures greater than 15 degrees cause measurable biomechanical stress on the knee joint[2].\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis condition can affect individuals of various ages but is particularly common in patients with cerebral palsy, those with post-surgical complications, and elderly patients with advanced osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis[6][8].\n\n---\n\n## Delayed Speech and Language Development (HP:0000750)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nSpeech and language delay is a **relatively common developmental finding** that can result from numerous etiologies including hearing loss, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, and many genetic syndromes. While important to identify, this finding alone lacks specificity for any particular disease.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis term applies primarily to **children under five years of age**. Males are statistically more likely to experience speech delays than females, though the reasons for this sex difference remain incompletely understood.\n\n---\n\n## Micrognathia (HP:0000347)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nMicrognathia (small mandible) is a **more specific craniofacial finding** that is associated with particular genetic syndromes and conditions. This feature is particularly informative when present in combination with other findings, as it appears in conditions such as Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome, and various genetic syndromes affecting craniofacial development.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nMicrognathia is present from birth and affects both males and females equally, though certain genetic syndromes associated with micrognathia may show sex-linked inheritance patterns depending on the specific condition.\n\n---\n\n## Full Cheeks (HP:0000293)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nFull or prominent cheeks represent a **non-specific facial feature** that varies widely in the general population based on genetics, body composition, and age. While this finding can be associated with certain conditions (such as Cushing syndrome or certain genetic syndromes), it is too common and variable to be diagnostically informative on its own.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present across all age groups and genders, though it may be more prominent in children and individuals with higher body weight.\n\n---\n\n## Adducted Thumb (HP:0001181)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nAdducted thumb (thumb-in-palm deformity) is a **specific and informative finding** that is associated with particular neurological and genetic conditions. This sign is particularly notable in conditions affecting upper motor neurons and in certain genetic syndromes. The presence of bilateral adducted thumbs is especially significant and suggests specific pathology.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis finding is present from birth or early infancy and affects both sexes equally. It is more commonly associated with conditions that manifest in early childhood.\n\n---\n\n## Elbow Flexion Contracture (HP:0002987)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nElbow flexion contracture is a **specific finding** indicating fixed limitation of elbow extension. Like knee flexion contractures, this represents significant underlying pathology and is associated with conditions such as cerebral palsy, arthritis, post-traumatic deformities, and prolonged immobilization.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis condition can affect individuals of any age but is particularly common in patients with cerebral palsy and those with chronic neurological conditions.\n\n---\n\n## Global Developmental Delay (HP:0001263)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nGlobal developmental delay is a **relatively common but non-specific finding** that indicates delayed achievement of developmental milestones across multiple domains. This term applies only to children under five years of age and can result from hundreds of different etiologies, making it useful as a screening finding but not specific for any particular disease.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis term is restricted to **children younger than five years of age**. It affects both males and females, though certain genetic conditions associated with developmental delay may show sex-linked patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Motor Delay (HP:0001270)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nMotor delay is a **common developmental finding** that is less specific than global developmental delay, as it focuses only on motor skill acquisition. This can result from numerous causes including cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophies, metabolic disorders, and many genetic syndromes.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis applies to **children**, typically identified in the first few years of life. Both males and females are affected, though certain conditions associated with motor delay (such as X-linked muscular dystrophies) show sex-specific patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Seizure (HP:0001250)\n\n**Common but Moderately Informative:**\nSeizures are a **relatively common neurological manifestation** that can occur in numerous conditions including epilepsy, metabolic disorders, infections, genetic syndromes, and brain injuries. While seizures indicate significant neurological involvement, they are not specific to any particular disease.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nSeizures can occur at any age, though certain types of seizures show age-specific patterns. Some genetic epilepsies show male predominance, while others affect both sexes equally.\n\n---\n\n## Breathing Dysregulation (HP:0005957)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nBreathing dysregulation is a **specific and potentially informative finding** that suggests involvement of respiratory control centers or neuromuscular systems. This finding is particularly significant when present in combination with other neurological features.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis can occur across age groups but is particularly notable in infants and young children with neurological conditions affecting brainstem function or in patients with neuromuscular disorders.\n\n---\n\n## Cerebellar Atrophy (HP:0001272)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nCerebellar atrophy is a **specific neuroimaging finding** that indicates irreversible loss of cerebellar tissue. This is highly informative as it suggests progressive neurological disease or prior injury and is associated with specific conditions such as spinocerebellar ataxias, metabolic disorders, and chronic toxin exposure.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis can develop at any age depending on the underlying etiology, though certain hereditary cerebellar atrophies show age-dependent onset patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Hypotonia (HP:0001252)\n\n**Common and Moderately Informative:**\nHypotonia (low muscle tone) is a **relatively common finding** in infants and young children that can result from numerous causes including cerebral palsy, metabolic disorders, genetic syndromes, and neuromuscular diseases. While important to identify, it lacks specificity without additional clinical context.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nHypotonia is typically identified in **infants and young children**. It affects both males and females, though certain conditions associated with hypotonia (such as X-linked myotubular myopathy) show sex-specific patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Apnea (HP:0002104)\n\n**Moderately Common and Informative:**\nApnea (absence of breathing) is a **significant clinical finding** that indicates respiratory control abnormalities or neuromuscular dysfunction. While not extremely rare, its presence is clinically important and suggests specific pathology affecting respiratory regulation.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nApnea is particularly common in **premature infants** and those with neurological conditions. It can occur at any age but is most clinically significant in infants and young children.\n\n---\n\n## Abnormal Pattern of Respiration (HP:0002793)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nAbnormal respiratory patterns are a **relatively common finding** that can result from numerous causes including neurological disorders, metabolic conditions, and pain or anxiety. This finding is non-specific without additional characterization.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis can occur across all age groups and affects both sexes equally.\n\n---\n\n## Drooling (HP:0002307)\n\n**Common and Moderately Informative:**\nDrooling is a **relatively common finding** that indicates difficulty with saliva control, often reflecting oropharyngeal dysfunction or neurological involvement. While common in infants, persistent drooling in older children or adults suggests specific pathology.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nDrooling is normal in **infants** but becomes pathological if persistent beyond age 4-5 years. When pathological, it is associated with conditions affecting oral motor control and is common in cerebral palsy and other neurological disorders affecting both sexes.\n\n---\n\n## Talipes Equinovarus (HP:0001762)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nClubfoot (talipes equinovarus) is a **specific congenital finding** with clear diagnostic significance. While it can occur as an isolated finding, its presence is informative and may suggest underlying genetic or neuromuscular conditions.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis congenital deformity is present at birth and affects males approximately twice as frequently as females. It occurs in approximately 1 per 1,000 live births.\n\n---\n\n## Constipation (HP:0002019)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nConstipation is a **very common symptom** in the general population that can result from numerous causes including dietary factors, medications, metabolic disorders, and neurological conditions. While important to identify, it is highly non-specific.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nConstipation affects individuals across all age groups and both sexes, though it becomes increasingly common with advancing age.\n\n---\n\n## Strabismus (HP:0000486)\n\n**Common and Moderately Informative:**\nStrabismus (eye misalignment) is a **relatively common finding** affecting approximately 3-4% of the population. While it can occur as an isolated finding, it may also indicate underlying neurological or genetic conditions.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nStrabismus typically manifests in **early childhood** and affects both males and females equally. Certain genetic syndromes associated with strabismus may show sex-linked inheritance patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Enlarged Naris (HP:0009931)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nEnlarged nostrils represent a **non-specific facial feature** that varies widely in the general population. While this can be associated with certain genetic syndromes or metabolic conditions, it is too common to be diagnostically informative on its own.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present across all age groups and both sexes, with significant variation based on ethnicity and genetics.\n\n---\n\n## Long Philtrum (HP:0000343)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nA long philtrum is a **relatively common facial feature** that shows significant variation in the general population. While associated with certain genetic syndromes (such as fetal alcohol spectrum disorder), it is not specific enough to be diagnostically informative without additional findings.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present across all age groups and both sexes, with variation based on ethnicity and genetics.\n\n---\n\n## Dimple Chin (HP:0010751)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nA dimpled chin is a **very common facial feature** present in a significant portion of the general population and is largely determined by genetics. This finding has minimal diagnostic significance on its own.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present across all age groups and both sexes, with significant variation based on ethnicity and family genetics.\n\n---\n\n## Camptodactyly (HP:0012385)\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nCamptodactyly (permanent flexion of fingers or toes) is a **specific finding** that indicates underlying contracture or neuromuscular pathology. This is particularly informative when present bilaterally or in multiple digits and is associated with specific genetic syndromes and neuromuscular conditions.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis can be present from birth or develop during childhood. It affects both males and females, though certain genetic conditions associated with camptodactyly show sex-linked inheritance patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Wide Nasal Bridge (HP:0000431)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nA wide nasal bridge is a **common facial feature** showing significant variation in the general population. While associated with certain genetic syndromes, it is too common to be diagnostically specific on its own.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present across all age groups and both sexes, with significant variation based on ethnicity and genetics.\n\n---\n\n## Short Columella (HP:0002000)\n\n**Moderately Rare and Informative:**\nA short columella is a **more specific craniofacial finding** that, when present in combination with other features, can be informative for certain genetic syndromes and conditions affecting nasal development.\n\n**Demographic Patterns:**\nThis feature is present from birth and affects both males and females equally, though certain genetic syndromes associated with short columella may show sex-linked patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table: Diagnostic Utility Classification\n\n| HPO Term | Specificity | Rarity | Primary Age Group | Gender Pattern |\n|----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Gastroesophageal reflux | Low | Common | All ages | Equal |\n| Knee flexion contracture | High | Moderate | All ages | Equal |\n| Delayed speech\/language | Low | Common | <5 years | Male predominance |\n| Micrognathia | High | Rare | Birth\/early childhood | Equal |\n| Full cheeks | Low | Very common | All ages | Equal |\n| Adducted thumb | High | Rare | Birth\/early childhood | Equal |\n| Elbow flexion contracture | High | Moderate | All ages | Equal |\n| Global developmental delay | Low | Common | <5 years | Equal |\n| Motor delay | Low | Common | Early childhood | Sex-linked variants |\n| Seizure | Moderate | Common | All ages | Condition-dependent |\n| Breathing dysregulation | High | Rare | Infants\/children | Equal |\n| Cerebellar atrophy | High | Rare | Variable | Equal |\n| Hypotonia | Moderate | Common | Infants\/children | Sex-linked variants |\n| Apnea | Moderate | Moderate | Infants\/children | Equal |\n| Abnormal respiration pattern | Low | Common | All ages | Equal |\n| Drooling | Moderate | Common | Infants\/children | Equal |\n| Talipes equinovarus | High | Rare | Birth | Male predominance (2:1) |\n| Constipation | Low | Very common | All ages | Increases with age |\n| Strabismus | Moderate | Common | Early childhood | Equal |\n| Enlarged naris | Low | Very common | All ages | Equal |\n| Long philtrum | Low | Common | All ages | Equal |\n| Dimple chin | Low | Very common | All ages | Equal |\n| Camptodactyly | High | Rare | Birth\/childhood | Sex-linked variants |\n| Wide nasal bridge | Low | Very common | All ages | Equal |\n| Short columella | Moderate | Moderate | Birth | Equal |\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"2, Male\ndelayed speech, motor delay, hypotonia, adducted thumb, elbow flexion contracture, knee flexion contracture, micrognathia, talipes equinovarus, camptodactyly, seizure, breathing dysregulation, apnea, cerebellar atrophy, drooling, strabismus, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, global developmental delay, abnormal pattern of respiration, full cheeks, enlarged naris, long philtrum, dimple chin, wide nasal bridge, short columella","sample_name":"HG01942"}

Hypotonia is not the same as muscle weakness, although the two conditions can co-exist.\" [https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:21418198]', 'synonym': ['Central hypotonia', 'Low muscle tone', 'Low or weak muscle tone', 'Muscle hypotonia', 'Muscular hypotonia', 'Peripheral hypotonia']}]\n\nAnswer the following three questions for each hpo term:\n1.

Rosacea-related facial features (not directly in HPO list but related to full cheeks or nasal changes) tend to be more severe in middle-aged or older adults, with some male predominance for rhinophyma[1][5][7].\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **More common and less informative terms:** Strabismus, global developmental delay, delayed speech\/language, motor delay, hypotonia, full cheeks, wide nasal bridge, long philtrum.\n\n- **Rare and more informative terms:** Camptodactyly, adducted thumb, elbow and knee flexion contractures, short columella, enlarged naris, micrognathia (especially in syndromic contexts).\n\n- **Age\/gender predispositions:** Most developmental and congenital features present in infancy or early childhood; strabismus primarily diagnosed in children but can occur at any age; some facial features related to rosacea worsen with age and have male predominance for certain subtypes (not directly HPO terms).\n\nThis synthesis integrates HPO definitions with clinical and epidemiological information from authoritative sources.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Rosacea-related facial features (not directly in HPO list but related to full cheeks or nasal changes) tend to be more severe in middle-aged or older adults, with some male predominance for rhinophyma[1][5][7].\n\n### Summary:\n\n- **More common and less informative terms:** Strabismus, global developmental delay, delayed speech\/language, motor delay, hypotonia, full cheeks, wide nasal bridge, long philtrum.\n\n- **Rare and more informative terms:** Camptodactyly, adducted thumb, elbow and knee flexion contractures, short columella, enlarged naris, micrognathia (especially in syndromic contexts).\n\n- **Age\/gender predispositions:** Most developmental and congenital features present in infancy or early childhood; strabismus primarily diagnosed in children but can occur at any age; some facial features related to rosacea worsen with age and have male predominance for certain subtypes (not directly HPO terms).\n\nThis synthesis integrates HPO definitions with clinical and epidemiological information from authoritative sources.\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"3, Female\nfull cheeks, strabismus, wide nasal bridge, enlarged naris, short columella, long philtrum, micrognathia, camptodactyly, adducted thumb, elbow flexion contracture, knee flexion contracture, global developmental delay, delayed speech and language development, motor delay, hypotonia","sample_name":"HG01083"}

It is less informative alone because hip contractures occur in many neuromuscular and connective tissue disorders[1][3][5]. | When combined with other specific contractures or syndromic features, it becomes more informative for specific diagnoses like AMC or Pena-Shokeir syndrome[1][3]. | No specific gender bias; occurs from birth or early childhood due to fetal akinesia or developmental issues[1][3][5]. |\n| **Short columella (HP:0002000)** | Relatively common facial feature in various syndromes but less informative alone due to variability in normal populations[4]. | More informative when seen with other craniofacial anomalies in syndromes such as certain craniofacial dysostoses or genetic syndromes[4]. | Can be present at birth; no strong gender predilection reported. Ethnic variation exists in normal columella length[4]. |\n| **Long philtrum (HP:0000343)** | Common facial variant; alone less informative as philtrum length varies with age, sex, and ethnicity[2][4][6][8]. | Rare and informative when markedly increased (>2 SD above mean) and associated with syndromes like fetal alcohol syndrome, Noonan syndrome, or Sotos syndrome[2][6]. | Philtrum length stabilizes after early adolescence (~12 years); males tend to have slightly longer philtrum than females[4][6][8]. |\n| **Micrognathia (HP:0000347)** | Common in many congenital syndromes (e.g., Pierre Robin sequence, trisomies), so alone it is less specific but clinically important[3][4]. | Highly informative in syndromes with mandibular hypoplasia; can be a key diagnostic feature[3]. | Present from birth; no strong gender bias; severity may vary with age as growth occurs[4][8]. |\n| **Full cheeks (HP:0000293)** | Common and nonspecific; often a normal variant or related to nutritional status, less informative alone[4]. | Rarely highly informative unless part of a syndrome with characteristic facial fullness (e.g., certain storage diseases)[4]. | No specific gender or age predilection; may be more prominent in infants and young children due to fat distribution[4]. |\n| **Camptodactyly (HP:0012385)** | Relatively common congenital hand anomaly; less informative alone as it appears in various conditions and isolated cases[1][3]. | More informative when part of syndromes with multiple contractures or connective tissue disorders[1][3]. | Present from birth;

It is less informative alone because hip contractures occur in many neuromuscular and connective tissue disorders[1][3][5]. | When combined with other specific contractures or syndromic features, it becomes more informative for specific diagnoses like AMC or Pena-Shokeir syndrome[1][3]. | No specific gender bias; occurs from birth or early childhood due to fetal akinesia or developmental issues[1][3][5]. |\n| **Short columella (HP:0002000)** | Relatively common facial feature in various syndromes but less informative alone due to variability in normal populations[4]. | More informative when seen with other craniofacial anomalies in syndromes such as certain craniofacial dysostoses or genetic syndromes[4]. | Can be present at birth; no strong gender predilection reported. Ethnic variation exists in normal columella length[4]. |\n| **Long philtrum (HP:0000343)** | Common facial variant; alone less informative as philtrum length varies with age, sex, and ethnicity[2][4][6][8]. | Rare and informative when markedly increased (>2 SD above mean) and associated with syndromes like fetal alcohol syndrome, Noonan syndrome, or Sotos syndrome[2][6]. | Philtrum length stabilizes after early adolescence (~12 years); males tend to have slightly longer philtrum than females[4][6][8]. |\n| **Micrognathia (HP:0000347)** | Common in many congenital syndromes (e.g., Pierre Robin sequence, trisomies), so alone it is less specific but clinically important[3][4]. | Highly informative in syndromes with mandibular hypoplasia; can be a key diagnostic feature[3]. | Present from birth; no strong gender bias; severity may vary with age as growth occurs[4][8]. |\n| **Full cheeks (HP:0000293)** | Common and nonspecific; often a normal variant or related to nutritional status, less informative alone[4]. | Rarely highly informative unless part of a syndrome with characteristic facial fullness (e.g., certain storage diseases)[4]. | No specific gender or age predilection;

Which HPO terms are **more common and less informative** for a specific disease?\n\nThese terms are relatively frequent in the general population or across many conditions, thus less specific for diagnosing a particular disease:\n\n- **Mitral valve prolapse (HP:0001634)**: Common, affecting up to 1 in 50 people, often asymptomatic and found incidentally. It is less informative alone because it occurs in many people without disease and can be mild or severe[1][3][5][6][7][8].\n\n- **Wide nasal bridge (HP:0000431)**: A common facial feature seen in many syndromes and normal variants; not highly specific.\n\n- **Constipation (HP:0002019)**: Very common symptom in many pediatric and adult conditions; nonspecific.\n\n- **Gastroesophageal reflux (HP:0002020)**: Common in infants and adults; often nonspecific.\n\n- **Drooling (HP:0002307)**: Common in young children and in various neurological or oral-motor disorders; nonspecific.\n\n- **Seizure (HP:0001250)**: Common neurological symptom with many possible causes; not specific to one disease.\n\n- **Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750)** and **Global developmental delay (HP:0001263)**: Common developmental concerns with broad differential diagnoses.\n\n- **Short neck (HP:0000470)**: Seen in many syndromes and normal variants; nonspecific.\n\n- **Full cheeks (HP:0000293)**: A common facial feature, nonspecific.\n\n- **Pursed lips (HP:0000205)**: Can be seen in various conditions or normal expressions; nonspecific.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Which HPO terms are **rare and informative** for a specific disease?\n\nThese terms are less common and more likely to point toward specific diagnoses or syndromes:\n\n- **Short columella (HP:0002000)**: A distinctive facial feature that may help narrow diagnosis in syndromes involving midface anomalies[PMID:19152422].\n\n- **Micrognathia (HP:0000347)**: A developmental hypoplasia of the mandible, often a key diagnostic clue in syndromes such as Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome, and others.\n\n- **Knee flexion contracture (HP:0006380)** and **Hip contracture (HP:0003273)**: These joint contractures are more specific and often seen in neuromuscular or connective tissue disorders.\n\n- **Talipes equinovarus (HP:0001762)** (clubfoot): A distinctive congenital foot deformity, informative for certain genetic syndromes and neuromuscular diseases.\n\n- **Camptodactyly (HP:0012385)**: Fixed flexion deformity of fingers or toes, seen in specific syndromes.\n\n- **Esotropia (HP:0000565)**: Inward turning of the eyes, can be a key feature in some genetic syndromes.\n\n- **Abnormal pattern of respiration (HP:0002793)** and **Breathing dysregulation (HP:0005957)**: More specific to neurological or metabolic disorders.\n\n- **Adducted thumb (HP:0001181)**: A distinctive hand posture that can be diagnostic in certain syndromes.\n\n- **Scoliosis (HP:0002650)**: While scoliosis is relatively common, its presence with other features can be informative for connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome or neuromuscular diseases.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Is there a specific **gender or age group** more likely to have these HPO terms?\n\n- **Mitral valve prolapse (HP:0001634)**: More common in **females** and typically diagnosed in **adolescents and young adults (age 14-30)**, though it can occur at any age. Serious symptoms tend to be more frequent in **men over 50**[1][3][5][6][7][8].\n\n- **Wide nasal bridge, short columella, micrognathia, full cheeks, long philtrum, enlarged naris**: These are anatomical features present from birth or early childhood, often identified in pediatric populations during syndrome evaluations.\n\n- **Inguinal hernia (HP:0000023)**: More common in **males**, especially in infants and young children.\n\n- **Constipation and gastroesophageal reflux**: Very common in **infants and children**, but can affect all ages.\n\n- **Drooling**: More common in **infants and young children**, or in adults with neurological impairment.\n\n- **Seizure**: Can occur at any age but certain seizure types are more common in pediatric populations.\n\n- **Delayed speech and language development, global developmental delay, motor delay**: Diagnosed in **children under 5 years**, as these terms relate to developmental milestones.\n\n- **Knee flexion contracture, hip contracture, camptodactyly, talipes equinovarus**: Usually identified in **infants or children** with congenital or early-onset conditions.\n\n- **Esotropia**: Often diagnosed in **infants and young children**.\n\n- **Short neck, scoliosis**: Can be congenital or develop during childhood\/adolescence.\n\n- **Adducted thumb**: Typically identified in **infants or young children** with congenital syndromes.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table for Selected Terms (based on available data and clinical knowledge):\n\n| HPO Term                  | Common & Less Informative? | Rare & Informative?          | Age\/Gender Predilection                      |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Mitral valve prolapse     | Yes                        | No                          | More in females; age 14-30; severe in men >50 |\n| Wide nasal bridge         | Yes                        | No                          | Present from birth; pediatric evaluation      |\n| Inguinal hernia           | Yes                        | No                          | More common in males; infants\/children        |\n| Short columella           | No                         | Yes                         | Pediatric; congenital syndromes               |\n| Micrognathia              | No                         | Yes                         | Pediatric; congenital syndromes               |\n| Full cheeks               | Yes                        | No                          | Pediatric; variable                            |\n| Constipation              | Yes                        | No                          | All ages; common in children                   |\n| Gastroesophageal reflux   | Yes                        | No                          | Common in infants and adults                   |\n| Drooling                  | Yes                        | No                          | Infants, neurological impairment              |\n| Seizure                   | Yes                        | No                          | All ages; various etiologies                   |\n| Delayed speech\/language   | Yes                        | No                          | Children under 5                               |\n| Short neck                | Yes                        | No                          | Congenital; pediatric                          |\n| Knee flexion contracture  | No                         | Yes                         | Pediatric; neuromuscular disorders             |\n| Talipes equinovarus       | No                         | Yes                         | Congenital; infants                            |\n| Camptodactyly             | No                         | Yes                         | Congenital; pediatric                          |\n| Esotropia                 | No                         | Yes                         | Pediatric; infants                             |\n| Abnormal pattern respiration | No                      | Yes                         | Neurological disorders; all ages               |\n| Adducted thumb            | No                         | Yes                         | Congenital; pediatric                          |\n| Scoliosis                 | No                         | Yes (if syndromic)          | Adolescents; congenital                        |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis integrates the detailed information on mitral valve prolapse from multiple authoritative sources and general clinical knowledge about other HPO terms.

It is less informative alone because it occurs in many people without disease and can be mild or severe[1][3][5][6][7][8].\n\n- **Wide nasal bridge (HP:0000431)**: A common facial feature seen in many syndromes and normal variants; not highly specific.\n\n- **Constipation (HP:0002019)**: Very common symptom in many pediatric and adult conditions; nonspecific.\n\n- **Gastroesophageal reflux (HP:0002020)**: Common in infants and adults; often nonspecific.\n\n- **Drooling (HP:0002307)**: Common in young children and in various neurological or oral-motor disorders; nonspecific.\n\n- **Seizure (HP:0001250)**: Common neurological symptom with many possible causes; not specific to one disease.\n\n- **Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750)** and **Global developmental delay (HP:0001263)**: Common developmental concerns with broad differential diagnoses.\n\n- **Short neck (HP:0000470)**: Seen in many syndromes and normal variants; nonspecific.\n\n- **Full cheeks (HP:0000293)**: A common facial feature, nonspecific.\n\n- **Pursed lips (HP:0000205)**: Can be seen in various conditions or normal expressions; nonspecific.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Which HPO terms are **rare and informative** for a specific disease?\n\nThese terms are less common and more likely to point toward specific diagnoses or syndromes:\n\n- **Short columella (HP:0002000)**: A distinctive facial feature that may help narrow diagnosis in syndromes involving midface anomalies[PMID:19152422].\n\n- **Micrognathia (HP:0000347)**: A developmental hypoplasia of the mandible, often a key diagnostic clue in syndromes such as Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome, and others.\n\n- **Knee flexion contracture (HP:0006380)** and **Hip contracture (HP:0003273)**: These joint contractures are more specific and often seen in neuromuscular or connective tissue disorders.\n\n- **Talipes equinovarus (HP:0001762)** (clubfoot): A distinctive congenital foot deformity, informative for certain genetic syndromes and neuromuscular diseases.\n\n- **Camptodactyly (HP:0012385)**: Fixed flexion deformity of fingers or toes, seen in specific syndromes.\n\n- **Esotropia (HP:0000565)**: Inward turning of the eyes, can be a key feature in some genetic syndromes.\n\n- **Abnormal pattern of respiration (HP:0002793)** and **Breathing dysregulation (HP:0005957)**: More specific to neurological or metabolic disorders.\n\n- **Adducted thumb (HP:0001181)**: A distinctive hand posture that can be diagnostic in certain syndromes.\n\n- **Scoliosis (HP:0002650)**: While scoliosis is relatively common, its presence with other features can be informative for connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome or neuromuscular diseases.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Is there a specific **gender or age group** more likely to have these HPO terms?\n\n- **Mitral valve prolapse (HP:0001634)**: More common in **females** and typically diagnosed in **adolescents and young adults (age 14-30)**, though it can occur at any age. Serious symptoms tend to be more frequent in **men over 50**[1][3][5][6][7][8].\n\n- **Wide nasal bridge, short columella, micrognathia, full cheeks, long philtrum, enlarged naris**: These are anatomical features present from birth or early childhood, often identified in pediatric populations during syndrome evaluations.\n\n- **Inguinal hernia (HP:0000023)**: More common in **males**, especially in infants and young children.\n\n- **Constipation and gastroesophageal reflux**: Very common in **infants and children**, but can affect all ages.\n\n- **Drooling**: More common in **infants and young children**, or in adults with neurological impairment.\n\n- **Seizure**: Can occur at any age but certain seizure types are more common in pediatric populations.\n\n- **Delayed speech and language development, global developmental delay, motor delay**: Diagnosed in **children under 5 years**, as these terms relate to developmental milestones.\n\n- **Knee flexion contracture, hip contracture, camptodactyly, talipes equinovarus**: Usually identified in **infants or children** with congenital or early-onset conditions.\n\n- **Esotropia**: Often diagnosed in **infants and young children**.\n\n- **Short neck, scoliosis**: Can be congenital or develop during childhood\/adolescence.\n\n- **Adducted thumb**: Typically identified in **infants or young children** with congenital syndromes.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table for Selected Terms (based on available data and clinical knowledge):\n\n| HPO Term                  | Common & Less Informative? | Rare & Informative?          | Age\/Gender Predilection                      |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Mitral valve prolapse     | Yes                        | No                          | More in females; age 14-30; severe in men >50 |\n| Wide nasal bridge         | Yes                        | No                          | Present from birth; pediatric evaluation      |\n| Inguinal hernia           | Yes                        | No                          | More common in males; infants\/children        |\n| Short columella           | No                         | Yes                         | Pediatric; congenital syndromes               |\n| Micrognathia              | No                         | Yes                         | Pediatric; congenital syndromes               |\n| Full cheeks               | Yes                        | No                          | Pediatric; variable                            |\n| Constipation              | Yes                        | No                          | All ages; common in children                   |\n| Gastroesophageal reflux   | Yes                        | No                          | Common in infants and adults                   |\n| Drooling                  | Yes                        | No                          | Infants, neurological impairment              |\n| Seizure                   | Yes                        | No                          | All ages; various etiologies                   |\n| Delayed speech\/language   | Yes                        | No                          | Children under 5                               |\n| Short neck                | Yes                        | No                          | Congenital; pediatric                          |\n| Knee flexion contracture  | No                         | Yes                         | Pediatric; neuromuscular disorders             |\n| Talipes equinovarus       | No                         | Yes                         | Congenital; infants                            |\n| Camptodactyly             | No                         | Yes                         | Congenital; pediatric                          |\n| Esotropia                 | No                         | Yes                         | Pediatric; infants                             |\n| Abnormal pattern respiration | No                      | Yes                         | Neurological disorders; all ages               |\n| Adducted thumb            | No                         | Yes                         | Congenital; pediatric                          |\n| Scoliosis                 | No                         | Yes (if syndromic)          | Adolescents; congenital                        |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis integrates the detailed information on mitral valve prolapse from multiple authoritative sources and general clinical knowledge about other HPO terms.

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms: Specificity and Clinical Significance\n\n## Overview of Term Categories\n\nBased on the search results and clinical literature, these HPO terms can be stratified by their diagnostic utility and specificity to particular genetic syndromes.\n\n## Common and Less Informative Terms\n\n**Full cheeks (HP:0000293)**, **delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750)**, **global developmental delay (HP:0001263)**, and **hypotonia (HP:0001252)** are relatively common features across multiple neurodevelopmental and genetic disorders, making them less specific for diagnosis.\n\nFull cheeks appear as a \"very frequent\" feature in 1p21.3 microdeletion syndrome and as a \"frequent\" feature in frontometaphyseal dysplasia[1][3]. However, this feature is nonspecific and can occur in various genetic conditions. Similarly, global developmental delay and speech delay are nearly universal findings in neurodevelopmental disorders, with global developmental delay present in 98% of Snijders Blok–Campeau syndrome cases and speech disorder\/delay in 92%[5]. These features lack discriminatory power because they occur across diverse genetic etiologies.\n\n**Motor delay (HP:0001270)**, **short neck (HP:0000470)**, and **gastroesophageal reflux (HP:0002020)** are also relatively nonspecific and can be secondary manifestations of various conditions rather than primary diagnostic indicators.\n\n## Rare and Highly Informative Terms\n\n**Wide nasal bridge (HP:0000431)** and **short columella (HP:0002000)** are more specific facial features that can help narrow differential diagnoses. Wide nasal bridge is documented as a \"very frequent\" feature in frontometaphyseal dysplasia[3] and appears in frontonasal dysplasia, where the nose may be \"unusually flat and broad\"[8]. These features, when combined with other dysmorphic characteristics, provide stronger diagnostic clues.\n\n**Micrognathia (HP:0000347)** is a distinctive feature appearing as \"frequent\" in both 1p21.3 microdeletion syndrome and frontometaphyseal dysplasia[1][3], making it more informative than general developmental delay when present in combination with other features.\n\n**Camptodactyly (HP:0012385)** and **adducted thumb (HP:0001181)** are skeletal-specific features that, when present, suggest particular genetic syndromes. These hand and finger abnormalities are more specific indicators of certain skeletal dysplasias and neuromuscular conditions.\n\n**Calcaneovalgus deformity (HP:0001848)** and **lumbar hyperlordosis (HP:0002938)** are relatively specific orthopedic findings that, when combined with other features, can help identify particular genetic conditions.\n\n**Umbilical hernia (HP:0001537)** and **enlarged naris (HP:0009931)** are moderately specific features that appear in particular syndrome clusters.\n\n## Gender and Age-Related Patterns\n\nThe search results do not provide explicit information regarding gender-specific prevalence for most of these HPO terms. However, some clinical observations can be noted:\n\n**Age-related considerations**: Global developmental delay, motor delay, and delayed speech and language development are specifically defined as features relevant to children younger than five years of age[1]. These terms become less applicable as children mature, even if developmental deficits persist. Facial dysmorphic features like full cheeks, micrognathia, and wide nasal bridge may become less pronounced or more apparent with age, as noted in Noonan syndrome where \"distinct features become less clear in adults\"[10].\n\n**Gender-specific features**: Frontonasal dysplasia-2 specifically notes that \"males with this form often have genital abnormalities, such as absence of one or both testes from the scrotum (cryptorchidism)\"[8], indicating sex-specific manifestations for certain conditions. However, most of the HPO terms listed do not show clear gender predilection in the available literature.\n\n**Developmental stage sensitivity**: Features like hypotonia and motor delay are most apparent during infancy and early childhood, while skeletal deformities like camptodactyly and calcaneovalgus deformity may be present from birth or early infancy but may improve or worsen with age depending on the underlying condition.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Ptosis (HP:0000508)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  - Ptosis is relatively common and can occur in both children and adults. It can be congenital (present at birth) or acquired later in life due to aging, trauma, nerve or muscle disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis), or surgery[1][3][7].\n  - Because ptosis can be caused by many different conditions (myogenic, neurogenic, aponeurotic, mechanical, traumatic), it is considered **less informative** by itself for diagnosing a specific disease unless accompanied by other signs or a known syndrome[7].\n  \n- **Rarity and Informativeness:**\n  - Rare forms of ptosis may be associated with specific genetic or neuromuscular disorders (e.g., congenital myasthenic syndromes, Horner syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1 with eyelid tumors)[3][7].\n  - In such contexts, ptosis becomes **more informative** as a diagnostic clue for these rare diseases.\n  \n- **Gender or Age Predilection:**\n  - Ptosis can affect *all ages* but congenital ptosis is diagnosed in children, while acquired ptosis is more common in older adults due to muscle aging or nerve damage[1][3][7].\n  - No strong gender predilection is reported for ptosis.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms: Clinical Significance and Diagnostic Value\n\n## Short Stature (HP:0004322)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative**\n\nShort stature is a **common and less informative** symptom for specific disease diagnosis. It affects approximately 2.5% of children and is one of the most frequent reasons for consulting a growth specialist[5]. The condition has numerous etiologies, ranging from familial short stature (FSS) to growth hormone deficiency, Turner syndrome, nutritional deficiencies, and various genetic mutations[3][5]. Because of its broad differential diagnosis, short stature alone is insufficient for identifying a specific underlying condition.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nShort stature can affect both males and females equally, though certain conditions associated with short stature show gender predilection. For example, Turner syndrome, which causes short stature, exclusively affects females[7]. Short stature typically becomes clinically apparent during childhood and is most commonly evaluated between ages 4-6 years, when growth patterns become more evident[7].\n\n## Scoliosis (HP:0002650)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative**\n\nScoliosis is a **moderately common but non-specific** finding. While it can occur as an isolated condition, it also appears as a secondary manifestation in various genetic and systemic disorders. In the context of growth disorders, scoliosis can worsen during accelerated growth periods, particularly in children receiving growth hormone therapy for conditions like Turner syndrome[7].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nScoliosis shows a female predominance in idiopathic cases, with girls being more frequently affected than boys. It typically develops during childhood and adolescence, with progression most likely during periods of rapid growth. Girls with Turner syndrome receiving growth hormone therapy are at increased risk for scoliosis worsening, presumably due to accelerated growth rates[7].\n\n## Camptodactyly (HP:0012385) and Camptodactyly of Finger (HP:0100490)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative**\n\nCamptodactyly is a **rare and highly informative** condition. It occurs in approximately 1% of the world population[2] and represents a specific structural abnormality of the hand. The condition is characterized by permanent flexion contracture of the proximal interphalangeal joint, most commonly affecting the fifth finger (pinky)[10]. While camptodactyly can occur sporadically or as part of various congenital syndromes, its presence is diagnostically significant and warrants investigation for underlying genetic or syndromic causes[2][4].\n\n**Genetic Inheritance and Specificity**\n\nCamptodactyly follows an **autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with incomplete penetrance**[16]. This means that affected individuals may show the condition in both hands, one hand, or neither hand, despite carrying the genetic mutation. The condition is associated with numerous congenital syndromes including Marfan syndrome, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, Beals syndrome, and others[2].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nCamptodactyly affects both males and females equally and is typically present at birth as a congenital condition. It is very rarely seen in children (1% prevalence), and most cases occur unilaterally (66%) rather than bilaterally (33%)[4]. The condition is most effectively treated surgically while the child is young and bones are not fully matured[6].\n\n## Vertebral Fusion (HP:0002948)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative**\n\nVertebral fusion is a **rare and moderately informative** finding. While congenital vertebral fusion can occur as an isolated anomaly, it is more commonly associated with specific genetic syndromes and skeletal dysplasias. Its presence suggests an underlying developmental or genetic disorder affecting spinal development.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nVertebral fusion is a congenital condition present from birth and affects both males and females. It is typically identified through imaging studies during childhood, often when investigating other symptoms or during evaluation for spinal abnormalities.\n\n## Ptosis (HP:0000508)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative**\n\nPtosis is a **common but non-specific** finding that can result from numerous etiologies including neuromuscular disorders, nerve compression, muscular dystrophies, and various genetic syndromes. While ptosis can be associated with specific conditions, it is not highly informative for disease diagnosis without additional clinical context[1].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nPtosis can affect both males and females and can present at any age depending on the underlying cause. Congenital ptosis may be present from birth, while acquired ptosis can develop at any point during life. There is no significant gender predilection for ptosis in general, though specific conditions causing ptosis may show gender-specific patterns.\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term | Rarity | Diagnostic Specificity | Gender Predilection | Age of Onset |\n|----------|--------|------------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Short stature | Common | Low | Equal | Childhood |\n| Scoliosis | Moderate | Low-Moderate | Female predominance | Childhood\/Adolescence |\n| Camptodactyly | Rare | High | Equal | Congenital |\n| Vertebral fusion | Rare | Moderate | Equal | Congenital |\n| Ptosis | Common | Low | Equal | Variable |","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms\n\n## HP:0000028 - Cryptorchidism (Undescended Testicles)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nCryptorchidism is a relatively common condition, particularly in premature infants, making it moderately informative rather than highly specific.[5] However, it is sufficiently distinctive to warrant clinical attention and specific diagnostic protocols. The condition occurs in approximately one-third of premature babies and can affect one or both testicles, with unilateral presentation being more common (occurring in two-thirds of cases).[3]\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nWhile cryptorchidism itself is not rare, it is highly informative for identifying potential underlying developmental or genetic disorders. The condition is associated with testicular dysgenesis syndrome, which collectively includes cryptorchidism, hypospadias, testicular cancer, and poor semen quality—suggesting a common etiology related to harmful environmental factors during fetal development.[3]\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nCryptorchidism is exclusively a male condition by definition. It is most commonly identified during the newborn examination in the first few days after birth.[9] The condition often resolves spontaneously within the first 12 weeks after birth, but if it persists beyond 4 to 5 months (for unilateral cases) or 8 weeks (for bilateral cases), specialist referral is recommended.[9] Surgical intervention (orchiopexy) is typically performed between 6 and 18 months of age for optimal outcomes.[3][7]\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000160 - Narrow Mouth (Microstomia)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nMicrostomia is a relatively uncommon condition with moderate to high informativeness depending on its etiology. Congenital microstomia is rare, occurring primarily in specific genetic syndromes such as Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa, and Agnathia-Microstomia-Synotia.[10] However, acquired microstomia is more common, frequently resulting from burns, trauma, or reconstruction surgery following oral cancer ablation.[10]\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nCongenital microstomia is rare and highly informative for specific genetic disorders. When present congenitally, it is often associated with other craniofacial abnormalities. For example, Agnathia-Microstomia-Synotia presents with an unusually small mouth, absence of the jaw bone, and underdeveloped or missing tongue.[2] Acquired microstomia can also occur as a complication of systemic diseases such as scleroderma, where it results from tightening of soft tissues of the face and mouth.[8]\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nMicrostomia can affect both males and females. Congenital forms may be identified in infancy or early childhood, while acquired forms can develop at any age depending on the causative event (burns, trauma, surgery, or systemic disease progression). In scleroderma patients, microstomia develops gradually as the disease progresses, affecting both sexes but with variable severity.[8]\n\n---\n\n## HP:0002650 - Scoliosis\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nScoliosis is a relatively common condition in the general population, making it less specific for identifying particular genetic or developmental disorders on its own. However, when present as part of a syndrome with other features, it becomes more informative. The search results do not provide specific prevalence data for scoliosis in the context of these HPO terms.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nScoliosis is not rare in isolation, but its presence alongside other specific features (such as cryptorchidism, microstomia, and camptodactyly) would be highly informative for identifying specific genetic syndromes. The search results provided do not contain detailed information about scoliosis in relation to the other HPO terms listed.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nScoliosis typically develops during childhood and adolescence, with higher prevalence in females during the growth period. The condition can be congenital or acquired.

Your job is to prepare a mock clinical epicrisis for this sample.\n\nYou're given the following information about the target hpo terms:\n<hpo_info>\n# Analysis of HPO Terms\n\n## HP:0000028 - Cryptorchidism (Undescended Testicles)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nCryptorchidism is a relatively common condition, particularly in premature infants, making it moderately informative rather than highly specific.[5] However, it is sufficiently distinctive to warrant clinical attention and specific diagnostic protocols. The condition occurs in approximately one-third of premature babies and can affect one or both testicles, with unilateral presentation being more common (occurring in two-thirds of cases).[3]\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nWhile cryptorchidism itself is not rare, it is highly informative for identifying potential underlying developmental or genetic disorders. The condition is associated with testicular dysgenesis syndrome, which collectively includes cryptorchidism, hypospadias, testicular cancer, and poor semen quality—suggesting a common etiology related to harmful environmental factors during fetal development.[3]\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nCryptorchidism is exclusively a male condition by definition. It is most commonly identified during the newborn examination in the first few days after birth.[9] The condition often resolves spontaneously within the first 12 weeks after birth, but if it persists beyond 4 to 5 months (for unilateral cases) or 8 weeks (for bilateral cases), specialist referral is recommended.[9] Surgical intervention (orchiopexy) is typically performed between 6 and 18 months of age for optimal outcomes.[3][7]\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000160 - Narrow Mouth (Microstomia)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nMicrostomia is a relatively uncommon condition with moderate to high informativeness depending on its etiology. Congenital microstomia is rare, occurring primarily in specific genetic syndromes such as Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa, and Agnathia-Microstomia-Synotia.[10] However, acquired microstomia is more common, frequently resulting from burns, trauma, or reconstruction surgery following oral cancer ablation.[10]\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nCongenital microstomia is rare and highly informative for specific genetic disorders. When present congenitally, it is often associated with other craniofacial abnormalities. For example, Agnathia-Microstomia-Synotia presents with an unusually small mouth, absence of the jaw bone, and underdeveloped or missing tongue.[2] Acquired microstomia can also occur as a complication of systemic diseases such as scleroderma, where it results from tightening of soft tissues of the face and mouth.[8]\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nMicrostomia can affect both males and females. Congenital forms may be identified in infancy or early childhood, while acquired forms can develop at any age depending on the causative event (burns, trauma, surgery, or systemic disease progression). In scleroderma patients, microstomia develops gradually as the disease progresses, affecting both sexes but with variable severity.[8]\n\n---\n\n## HP:0002650 - Scoliosis\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nScoliosis is a relatively common condition in the general population, making it less specific for identifying particular genetic or developmental disorders on its own. However, when present as part of a syndrome with other features, it becomes more informative. The search results do not provide specific prevalence data for scoliosis in the context of these HPO terms.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nScoliosis is not rare in isolation, but its presence alongside other specific features (such as cryptorchidism, microstomia, and camptodactyly) would be highly informative for identifying specific genetic syndromes. The search results provided do not contain detailed information about scoliosis in relation to the other HPO terms listed.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nScoliosis typically develops during childhood and adolescence, with higher prevalence in females during the growth period. The condition can be congenital or acquired. Without specific syndrome information in the search results, general age and gender patterns cannot be definitively stated for this particular query context.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0012385 - Camptodactyly\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nCamptodactyly is a relatively uncommon condition characterized by permanent flexion of fingers or toes that cannot be fully extended.

Scoliosis (HP:0002650)  \n**Definition:** Abnormal lateral curvature of the spine, often quantified by a Cobb angle >10°.\n\n**1. Commonality and Informativeness:**  \n- Scoliosis is relatively **common**, especially adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), affecting about 2-3% of the population[7].  \n- It is **less informative** for specific diseases because scoliosis can be idiopathic or secondary to many conditions (neuromuscular, congenital, syndromic).  \n- The Cobb angle measurement is a standard clinical tool to assess severity and guide treatment[1][3][5][7][9][11][13].\n\n**2. Rarity and Informativeness:**  \n- Severe scoliosis (Cobb angle >40°) is less common and more informative for specific diseases or syndromes causing progressive spinal deformities[1][9].  \n- Scoliosis associated with certain syndromes or neuromuscular diseases is more specific and thus informative.\n\n**3. Gender\/Age Predilection:**  \n- Most common in **adolescents**, particularly during growth spurts (adolescent idiopathic scoliosis)[7].  \n- Females are more likely to have progressive scoliosis requiring treatment[7][13].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Flexion Contracture (HP:0001371)  \n**Definition:** A bent joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively due to structural changes in muscles, tendons, ligaments, or skin.\n\n**1. Commonality and Informativeness:**  \n- Flexion contractures are **common** in various conditions (arthritis, trauma, immobilization) and thus are **less specific** for a particular disease[2][6][12][14][16].  \n- They are often a secondary complication rather than a primary diagnostic feature.\n\n**2. Rarity and Informativeness:**  \n- When occurring in unusual locations or in congenital syndromes, flexion contractures can be more **informative** for specific diagnoses (e.g., pterygium syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta)[4].  \n- Persistent or severe contractures refractory to treatment may suggest underlying rare conditions.\n\n**3.

Scoliosis (HP:0002650)  \n**Definition:** Abnormal lateral curvature of the spine, often quantified by a Cobb angle >10°.\n\n**1. Commonality and Informativeness:**  \n- Scoliosis is relatively **common**, especially adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), affecting about 2-3% of the population[7].  \n- It is **less informative** for specific diseases because scoliosis can be idiopathic or secondary to many conditions (neuromuscular, congenital, syndromic).  \n- The Cobb angle measurement is a standard clinical tool to assess severity and guide treatment[1][3][5][7][9][11][13].\n\n**2. Rarity and Informativeness:**  \n- Severe scoliosis (Cobb angle >40°) is less common and more informative for specific diseases or syndromes causing progressive spinal deformities[1][9].  \n- Scoliosis associated with certain syndromes or neuromuscular diseases is more specific and thus informative.\n\n**3. Gender\/Age Predilection:**  \n- Most common in **adolescents**, particularly during growth spurts (adolescent idiopathic scoliosis)[7].  \n- Females are more likely to have progressive scoliosis requiring treatment[7][13].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Flexion Contracture (HP:0001371)  \n**Definition:** A bent joint that cannot be straightened actively or passively due to structural changes in muscles, tendons, ligaments, or skin.\n\n**1. Commonality and Informativeness:**  \n- Flexion contractures are **common** in various conditions (arthritis, trauma, immobilization) and thus are **less specific** for a particular disease[2][6][12][14][16].  \n- They are often a secondary complication rather than a primary diagnostic feature.\n\n**2. Rarity and Informativeness:**  \n- When occurring in unusual locations or in congenital syndromes, flexion contractures can be more **informative** for specific diagnoses (e.g., pterygium syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta)[4].  \n- Persistent or severe contractures refractory to treatment may suggest underlying rare conditions.\n\n**3. Gender\/Age Predilection:**  \n- Can occur at any age but more frequent in **older adults** with arthritis or after injury\/surgery[2][4][6][10].  \n- No strong gender predilection reported.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms\n\n## HP:0000160 - Narrow Mouth (Microstomia)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nNarrow mouth is a relatively common symptom that appears across multiple conditions, making it less specific for diagnosis. It can result from various causes including congenital malformations, acquired conditions from burns, and progressive skin disorders like scleroderma[5][7]. This broad range of etiologies limits its diagnostic specificity.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nWhile not rare as a symptom, narrow mouth becomes more informative when combined with other features. It is a defining characteristic of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome (also called \"whistling face syndrome\"), where it appears alongside a distinctive whistling-face appearance with pursed lips and an \"H\" or \"V\"-shaped chin dimple[3][9]. It also appears in Agnathia-Microstomia-Synotia, a rare congenital malformation[1].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nNo specific gender predilection is documented. Congenital causes present at birth or in early infancy, while acquired causes (such as from scleroderma) typically develop in adulthood.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0012385 - Camptodactyly\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nCamptodactyly occurs in less than 1% of the population, making it relatively uncommon[6]. However, it is not highly specific for a single disease, as it can occur as an isolated condition or as part of multiple congenital syndromes including Jacobsen syndrome, Beals syndrome, Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, and many others[2]. This association with numerous syndromes reduces its diagnostic specificity when appearing alone.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nCamptodactyly becomes more informative when it appears as part of a syndrome cluster. In Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, camptodactyly presents as tightly bent fingers with possible ulnar deviation, appearing alongside the characteristic facial features and other joint contractures[3]. The condition is characterized by a fixed flexion deformity at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint, most commonly affecting the fifth finger[2][4].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nCamptodactyly shows no gender predilection. It presents in different types based on age: Type I affects the small finger and presents in infancy (first year of life), Type II affects the small finger and presents in adolescence (after 10 years of age), and Type III involves multiple digits with severe contractures and presents at birth[4].\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000028 - Cryptorchidism\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nCryptorchidism (undescended testes) is a relatively common condition in newborns but is not particularly informative for specific rare disease diagnosis on its own. It appears in various genetic syndromes and conditions but is not a hallmark feature of most rare diseases.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nCryptorchidism is not rare as a standalone condition, but when it appears as part of a syndrome constellation with other features, it may contribute to diagnosis. However, the search results provided do not contain specific information linking cryptorchidism to the other HPO terms or syndromes discussed.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nCryptorchidism is exclusively a male condition by definition. It typically presents in infancy or early childhood, with most cases resolving spontaneously by age one year, though some persist into adulthood.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0002650 - Scoliosis\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nScoliosis is a relatively common condition affecting spinal curvature and is not highly specific for rare disease diagnosis. It can occur as an isolated condition or secondary to various genetic syndromes, connective tissue disorders, and neuromuscular conditions. This broad association limits its diagnostic specificity.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nScoliosis becomes more informative when it appears as part of a specific syndrome phenotype. However, the search results provided do not contain detailed information about scoliosis in relation to the specific rare diseases discussed (Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, camptodactyly syndromes, etc.).\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nScoliosis shows a female predominance, particularly for progressive curves requiring treatment. It typically develops during childhood and adolescence, with onset often occurring during growth spurts.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0001371 - Flexion Contracture\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nFlexion contracture is a relatively common finding across multiple conditions and is therefore less specific for diagnosis. It represents a general pathophysiological process rather than a disease-specific feature[1].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nFlexion contracture becomes highly informative when it appears in specific patterns and locations. In Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, contractures affecting multiple body areas (commonly hands and feet) are a defining characteristic, with restricted joint movement being present in virtually all patients[3][9]. The combination of facial contractures producing the distinctive \"whistling face\" appearance alongside hand and foot contractures is highly specific for Freeman-Sheldon syndrome.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nNo specific gender predilection is documented. Contractures can be present at birth (congenital) or develop over time depending on the underlying condition.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0001762 - Talipes Equinovarus (Clubfoot)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nTalipes equinovarus (clubfoot) is a relatively common congenital condition occurring in approximately 1 in 1,000 births. While not highly specific for rare disease diagnosis on its own, it can appear as part of various genetic syndromes and conditions.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nClubfoot becomes more informative when it appears alongside other distinctive features as part of a syndrome. However, the search results provided do not contain specific information linking clubfoot to Freeman-Sheldon syndrome or the other conditions discussed in detail.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nClubfoot shows a male predominance (approximately 2:1 male-to-female ratio). It is a congenital condition present at birth.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Specificity | Age of Onset | Gender Predilection |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|\n| Narrow mouth | Moderate | Low (multiple causes) | Birth to adulthood | None |\n| Camptodactyly | Rare (<1%) | Moderate (multiple syndromes) | Birth to adolescence | None |\n| Cryptorchidism | Moderate | Low | Infancy\/childhood | Male only |\n| Scoliosis | Common | Low | Childhood\/adolescence | Female predominance |\n| Flexion contracture | Moderate-Common | Low (general finding) | Birth to adulthood | None |\n| Clubfoot | Moderate | Low (multiple causes) | Birth | Male predominance |\n\nThe most informative HPO terms when appearing together are **narrow mouth, camptodactyly, and flexion contractures**, which form a characteristic triad highly suggestive of Freeman-Sheldon syndrome[3][9].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms\n\n## HP:0200006 - Slanting of the Palpebral Fissure\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nThis term is relatively common across multiple genetic syndromes and is therefore less informative for identifying a specific disease. Down-slanted palpebral fissures appear in numerous conditions including Noonan syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and Marfan syndrome[10]. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome also presents with down-slanting palpebral fissures as one of several craniofacial features[4].\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nWhile the feature itself is not rare, its presence in combination with other specific features can aid in clinical diagnosis. However, as a standalone finding, it lacks diagnostic specificity.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nThis is a congenital feature present at birth and affects both genders equally. There is no gender or age predilection for this anatomical variation.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0007776 - Sparse Lower Eyelashes\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nSparse eyelashes represent a relatively common feature across various conditions affecting hair growth. This term is less informative as a standalone diagnostic marker because it can result from multiple etiologies including genetic disorders, aging, hormonal changes, and acquired conditions[3][6].\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nSparse eyelashes are particularly associated with hypotrichosis conditions. Autosomal recessive hypotrichosis characteristically presents with sparse eyebrows, eyelashes, and body hair[2]. Marie Unna hereditary hypotrichosis is characterized by absence or scarcity of eyelashes at birth[11]. However, eyelash sparsity alone is not specific enough to distinguish between different types of hypotrichosis or other conditions.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nCongenital forms affect both genders equally from birth. Acquired hypotrichosis of eyelashes can develop later in life due to aging, hormonal fluctuations (particularly menopause), or other factors[3][6]. Women may be more likely to seek treatment for cosmetic concerns related to sparse eyelashes.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0011800 - Midface Retrusion\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nMidface retrusion is a moderately specific craniofacial feature that appears in several genetic syndromes. While not extremely common, it is present in enough conditions to be considered somewhat non-specific when appearing alone. However, it becomes more informative when combined with other facial features.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nMidface retrusion appears in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, where affected individuals typically have a relatively flat face due to underdeveloped eye sockets, cheekbones, and lower jaw[4]. This feature, combined with other craniofacial anomalies, contributes to the syndrome's diagnostic profile.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nThis is a congenital feature present from birth and affects both genders equally. The severity may become more apparent as the child grows and facial proportions become more evident.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000347 - Micrognathia\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nMicrognathia (underdevelopment of the mandible) is a relatively common craniofacial feature appearing in multiple genetic syndromes and is therefore less informative as a standalone diagnostic marker. It can occur in isolation or as part of syndromic presentations.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nWhile micrognathia itself is not rare, its presence in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome contributes to the characteristic facial appearance with underdeveloped lower jaw[4]. It becomes more diagnostically useful when combined with other specific features such as craniosynostosis and syndactyly.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nThis is a congenital feature detectable at birth and affects both genders equally. The severity may become more apparent during childhood as facial growth patterns develop.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000185 - Cleft Soft Palate\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nCleft soft palate is a relatively common birth defect that appears in numerous genetic syndromes and therefore has limited specificity as a diagnostic marker when appearing alone. It can occur as an isolated defect or as part of syndromic conditions.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nWhile cleft palate is not rare in the general population, its presence in specific genetic syndromes (such as Saethre-Chotzen syndrome) contributes to the overall clinical picture[4]. However, it is not specific enough to identify a particular syndrome without additional features.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nCleft soft palate is a congenital defect present at birth. There is a slight female predominance in some populations, though this varies geographically. The condition is detected at birth or shortly thereafter.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000365 - Hearing Impairment\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nHearing impairment is a common feature across many genetic syndromes and acquired conditions, making it relatively non-specific for diagnostic purposes. It can result from multiple etiologies including congenital syndromes, infections, aging, and environmental factors.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nHearing loss appears in various genetic conditions including Kabuki syndrome and other rare genetic disorders[1]. However, as a standalone feature, it lacks diagnostic specificity and requires correlation with other clinical findings.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nCongenital hearing impairment affects both genders equally and is typically identified in infancy through newborn screening. Acquired hearing loss can develop at any age, with increased prevalence in older populations due to age-related changes.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0002974 - Radioulnar Synostosis\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nRadioulnar synostosis (fusion of the radius and ulna) is a relatively rare skeletal finding that is more informative for specific genetic conditions. This feature is less commonly seen across multiple syndromes, making it more diagnostically valuable when present.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nRadioulnar synostosis is a rare skeletal anomaly that, when present, suggests specific genetic syndromes. Its rarity makes it more informative than common features, though it still requires correlation with other clinical findings for definitive diagnosis.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nThis is a congenital skeletal abnormality affecting both genders equally. It is typically detectable on imaging studies during infancy or early childhood, though the fusion may have been present since fetal development.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Informativeness | Rarity\/Specificity | Gender Predilection | Age of Onset |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| Slanting of palpebral fissure | Common | Low | Non-specific | None | Congenital |\n| Sparse lower eyelashes | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | None (cosmetic concern more common in women) | Congenital or acquired |\n| Midface retrusion | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | None | Congenital |\n| Micrognathia | Moderate | Low | Non-specific | None | Congenital |\n| Cleft soft palate | Common | Low | Non-specific | Slight female predominance | Congenital |\n| Hearing impairment | Common | Low | Non-specific | None | Congenital or acquired |\n| Radioulnar synostosis | Rare | High | Specific | None | Congenital |","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

For example, down-slanting palpebral fissures are a common facial feature in these syndromes but are not unique to any single disorder, making it less informative for diagnosis on its own[5][4].\n\n- **Micrognathia (HP:0000347)** is also a relatively common feature seen in various syndromes such as Treacher Collins syndrome and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. While it is a significant craniofacial anomaly, it is present in many conditions, which reduces its specificity as a diagnostic marker by itself[2][4].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Which of these HPO terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n\n- **Radioulnar synostosis (HP:0002974)** is a rarer and more informative feature because it involves an abnormal bony fusion between the radius and ulna, which is less commonly seen across disorders. Its presence can be more specific and helpful in diagnosing particular skeletal dysplasias or syndromes that include limb anomalies[1].\n\n- While micrognathia is common, its *severe* forms or association with specific genetic mutations (e.g., in Treacher Collins syndrome) can be more informative diagnostically[2].\n\n- Slanting of the palpebral fissure, when combined with other distinctive features, can become informative, but alone it is less specific.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Is there a specific gender or age group more likely to have these HPO terms?\n\n- **Slanting of the palpebral fissure** and **micrognathia** are congenital features, typically evident at birth or early childhood, as they relate to craniofacial development. They are not strongly linked to any specific gender but are seen across both males and females in congenital syndromes[4][5].\n\n- **Radioulnar synostosis** is also congenital and usually identified in childhood due to limb movement limitations. It is not gender-specific but depends on the underlying syndrome or genetic cause[1].\n\n- Some syndromes with these features may show gender bias due to inheritance patterns. For example, Renpenning syndrome (not directly linked to these terms here but relevant for X-linked disorders) affects mostly males due to X-linked inheritance[3].\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                       | Commonality          | Informative Value            | Typical Age of Onset | Gender Predilection          |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Slanting of the palpebral fissure (HP:0200006) | Common in multiple syndromes | Less informative alone       | Congenital\/early childhood | No strong gender bias        |\n| Micrognathia (HP:0000347)     | Common in many syndromes | Informative if severe or syndrome-specific | Congenital\/early childhood | No strong gender bias        |\n| Radioulnar synostosis (HP:0002974) | Rare                  | More informative, specific to certain syndromes | Congenital\/early childhood | No strong gender bias        |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on clinical descriptions of syndromes featuring these phenotypes, such as Treacher Collins syndrome, Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and others[1][2][4][5].

Also seen in syndromes with craniofacial anomalies like Saethre-Chotzen syndrome[4]. | Congenital, present at birth; no clear gender predilection. |\n| **HP:0000365 Hearing impairment** | Hearing impairment is a common symptom with many causes including genetic syndromes, infections, aging, and environmental factors. Alone, it is less informative for specific diseases[1]. | Hearing loss is informative in syndromic contexts such as Kabuki syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and others where it is part of a constellation of features[1]. | Can present at any age depending on cause; no consistent gender predilection. Congenital forms present early. |\n| **HP:0001172 Abnormal thumb morphology** | Abnormal thumb morphology is less common than the above features and more specific. It is seen in syndromes such as Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Holt-Oram syndrome, and others[1]. | It is informative for specific syndromes involving limb malformations and can help narrow diagnosis when present[1]. | Congenital; no specific gender predilection reported. |\n\n### Summary of Key Points:\n\n- **More common and less informative terms:**  \n  - *Slanting of the palpebral fissure* (common in many syndromes)  \n  - *Midface retrusion* (common craniofacial feature)  \n  - *Micrognathia* (common in multiple syndromes)  \n  - *Hearing impairment* (common symptom with many causes)  \n  - *Sparse lower eyelashes* can be common due to non-genetic causes (aging, inflammation) but less informative alone.\n\n- **Rare and informative terms:**  \n  - *Sparse lower eyelashes* in the context of rare genetic hypotrichosis syndromes (e.g., autosomal recessive hypotrichosis, Marie Unna hereditary hypotrichosis)  \n  - *Abnormal thumb morphology* is relatively rare and more specific for syndromes with limb anomalies.\n\n- **Gender and age:**  \n  - Most of these features are congenital or present early in life when associated with genetic syndromes.  \n  - Sparse eyelashes can also be acquired later in life due to aging or hormonal changes, particularly in women.  \n  - No strong gender predilection is reported for these features in genetic syndromes.\n\nThis analysis integrates clinical descriptions and genetic syndrome associations from multiple sources, including rare disease databases and genetic condition summaries[1][2][3][4][5][7][8][10].\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"5, Female\nslanting palpebral fissures, sparse lower eyelashes, midface retrusion, micrognathia, hearing impairment, abnormal thumb","sample_name":"HG03649"}

No strong gender bias, but hormonal causes may affect adults, especially women[3][6]. |\n| **HP:0011800 - Midface retrusion** | Midface retrusion is less common and more specific; it is a key feature in syndromes like Noonan syndrome, Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, and others with craniofacial anomalies[1][4]. | Informative for syndromes with craniofacial dysmorphisms such as Noonan syndrome and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome[1][4]. | Congenital, seen in children with genetic syndromes; no specific gender predilection noted. |\n| **HP:0000347 - Micrognathia** | Micrognathia is a relatively common craniofacial anomaly seen in many syndromes (e.g., Pierre Robin sequence, Noonan syndrome, Saethre-Chotzen syndrome), so alone it is less specific[4][1]. | It is informative when combined with other features in syndromes involving mandibular hypoplasia[4]. | Congenital, present at birth; no clear gender bias. |\n| **HP:0000378 - Cupped ear** | Cupped ears are less common and can be a distinctive dysmorphic feature in certain syndromes like Kabuki syndrome[1]. | Informative for syndromes such as Kabuki syndrome and others with characteristic ear morphology[1]. | Congenital; no specific gender or age bias. |\n| **HP:0000402 - Stenosis of the external auditory canal** | This is a relatively rare anatomical anomaly and can be informative for syndromes involving ear malformations (e.g., Treacher Collins syndrome)[4]. | Informative for syndromes with ear canal malformations and conductive hearing loss[4]. | Congenital; no gender bias reported. |\n| **HP:0000365 - Hearing impairment** | Hearing impairment is common in many conditions, both genetic and acquired, so alone it is less informative[1]. | When combined with other features, it can be informative for syndromes like Kabuki syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and others[1]. | Can be congenital or acquired; affects all ages and genders. |\n| **HP:0009778 - Short thumb** | Short thumb (thumb hypoplasia) is less common and can be a distinctive feature in syndromes like Holt-Oram syndrome and others with limb anomalies[1]. | Informative for syndromes with limb malformations[1]. | Congenital; no gender bias. |\n| **HP:0000750 - Delayed speech and language development** | Delayed speech is common in many neurodevelopmental disorders and is less specific alone[1][7]. | Informative when combined with intellectual disability or syndromic features (e.g., Xia-Gibbs syndrome)[7]. | Typically identified in early childhood; no gender bias. |\n| **HP:0004322 - Short stature** | Short stature is common and nonspecific, seen in many genetic and non-genetic conditions[1]. | Informative when combined with other syndromic features (e.g., Noonan syndrome)[1]. | Can be congenital or develop in childhood; no gender bias. |\n| **HP:0010109 - Short hallux** | Short big toe (hallux) is rare and can be informative for syndromes with limb anomalies[1]. | Informative for specific syndromes affecting limb development[1]. | Congenital; no gender bias. |\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- **Sparse lower eyelashes (HP:0007776)** is a key feature in *autosomal recessive hypotrichosis* caused by mutations in genes like *LIPH*, *LPAR6*, and *DSG4*, which is a rare genetic disorder affecting hair growth from infancy[2][5][8]. It can also be acquired due to aging or inflammation but is less informative in those contexts[3][6].\n\n- **Slanting of the palpebral fissure (HP:0200006)**, especially down-slanting, is a common dysmorphic feature in multiple syndromes but is rarely seen as an isolated finding. It is important diagnostically when combined with other features[4][10].\n\n- **Midface retrusion (HP:0011800)** and **micrognathia (HP:0000347)** are common craniofacial features in syndromes with facial hypoplasia and are informative in the context of syndromic diagnosis[1][4].\n\n- Most of these features are congenital and present from birth or early childhood, with no strong gender predilection reported in the literature. Some features like sparse eyelashes may have acquired causes more common in adults, especially women due to hormonal changes[3][6].\n\nThis synthesis is based on the combination of genetic syndromes and clinical features described in the search results and medical genetics knowledge.\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"5, Female\nSlanting of the palpebral fissure, Sparse lower eyelashes, Midface retrusion, Micrognathia, Cupped ear, Stenosis of the external auditory canal, Hearing impairment, Short thumb, Delayed speech and language development, Short stature, Short hallux","sample_name":"NA19920"}

Down-slanted palpebral fissures are commonly seen in genetic syndromes such as Noonan syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, or Marfan syndrome[2]. This feature can manifest as either downward or upward slanting, and its presence alongside other distinct features aids in clinical diagnosis rather than serving as a definitive marker[2].\n\n**Rarity and Diagnostic Value:**\nWhile the feature itself is not rare, specific patterns of slanting combined with other craniofacial features can be more informative. For example, the combination of downslanted palpebral fissures with other characteristics like hypertelorism, arched eyebrows, and specific ear morphology may point toward particular syndromes[5].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nThe search results do not indicate gender or age-specific prevalence for this feature. Slanting of the palpebral fissure is typically congenital and detectable at birth as part of general craniofacial dysmorphism[5].\n\n---\n\n## Micrognathia (HP:0000347)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nMicrognathia (underdevelopment of the mandible) is a relatively common craniofacial feature that can appear in various genetic syndromes and conditions. While it is a recognizable feature, it is not highly specific on its own and requires evaluation alongside other clinical findings for accurate diagnosis.\n\n**Rarity and Diagnostic Value:**\nMicrognathia becomes more diagnostically valuable when present with other specific features. For instance, it may be part of a recognizable pattern in syndromes affecting craniofacial development, but the search results do not provide specific information about which syndromes feature micrognathia as a particularly distinctive marker.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nThe search results do not provide gender-specific information regarding micrognathia. However, this feature is typically present from birth or becomes apparent during early development.\n\n---\n\n## Abnormal Soft Palate Morphology (HP:0100736)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nAbnormal soft palate morphology is a relatively nonspecific feature that can occur in various genetic and developmental conditions. The search results mention cleft lip and\/or palate as features in conditions like Kabuki syndrome[1], but do not provide detailed information about soft palate morphology specifically as a diagnostic marker.\n\n**Rarity and Diagnostic Value:**\nThis feature alone is not particularly rare or highly informative for specific disease diagnosis. It typically requires correlation with other systemic features and genetic findings for meaningful clinical interpretation.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nThe search results do not provide gender or age-specific prevalence data for abnormal soft palate morphology.\n\n---\n\n## Hearing Impairment (HP:0000365)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nHearing impairment is a relatively common feature across multiple genetic syndromes and is therefore less specific for diagnosis on its own. It appears as a feature in several rare genetic conditions but is not unique to any particular disorder. The search results mention hearing loss as a feature in Kabuki syndrome[1], but this is one of many systemic features.\n\n**Rarity and Diagnostic Value:**\nWhile hearing loss itself is not rare as a symptom, its presence in combination with other specific features can contribute to syndrome identification. However, hearing impairment alone has limited diagnostic specificity.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nThe search results do not indicate gender-specific prevalence for hearing impairment in genetic syndromes. Hearing loss can be congenital or develop over time depending on the underlying condition.\n\n---\n\n## Short Thumb (HP:0009778)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nShort thumb (thumb hypoplasia) is a relatively specific skeletal feature that can be more informative than some other features. While it appears in various genetic conditions, its presence may narrow the differential diagnosis when combined with other findings.\n\n**Rarity and Diagnostic Value:**\nShort thumb can be more diagnostically valuable than nonspecific features like hearing loss or palatal abnormalities. The search results mention persistent fingertip pads and skeletal differences in Kabuki syndrome[1], suggesting that specific hand and thumb morphology can be part of recognizable syndrome patterns.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nThe search results do not provide gender-specific information regarding short thumbs. This feature is typically congenital and apparent from birth or early infancy.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Diagnostic Specificity | Gender\/Age Notes |\n|----------|-------------|------------------------|------------------|\n| Slanting of palpebral fissure | Common | Low-moderate | Congenital; no gender specificity noted |\n| Micrognathia | Moderate | Low-moderate | Congenital; no gender specificity noted |\n| Abnormal soft palate morphology | Moderate | Low | Congenital; no gender specificity noted |\n| Hearing impairment | Common | Low | Variable onset; no gender specificity noted |\n| Short thumb | Moderate | Moderate-high | Congenital; no gender specificity noted |\n\nThe search results do not provide sufficient information to definitively rank all features by rarity or to identify specific gender or age groups more likely to present with these features.

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms and Their Clinical Significance\n\n## Overview of the HPO Terms\n\nBased on the search results, I can provide analysis of these seven HPO terms regarding their specificity, rarity, and demographic associations in genetic syndromes.\n\n## Slanting of the Palpebral Fissure (HP:0200006)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nSlanting of the palpebral fissure is a relatively common feature across multiple genetic syndromes. Down-slanted palpebral fissures are commonly seen in genetic syndromes such as Noonan syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, and Marfan syndrome[9]. This feature appears frequently enough that it requires additional clinical context and accompanying features to be diagnostically useful.\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nWhile the general feature is common, specific patterns of slanting combined with other features can be more informative. For example, down-slanting palpebral fissures paired with other distinct craniofacial features aid in clinical diagnosis[9].\n\n**Demographics:**\nNo specific gender or age predilection is noted in the search results for this feature alone.\n\n## Midface Retrusion (HP:0011800)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nMidface retrusion is a relatively common feature across multiple craniofacial syndromes. It affects individuals with Crouzon syndrome, Muenke syndrome, Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, and other conditions[2][4][6][7]. The search results indicate that midface hypoplasia can affect anyone, including those with no medical problems whatsoever, and often has a familial predisposition[4].\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nWhen midface retrusion appears as part of a specific syndrome constellation with other characteristic features, it becomes more diagnostically valuable. For instance, in Crouzon syndrome, midface retrusion is combined with craniosynostosis and exophthalmos[2].\n\n**Demographics:**\nMidface hypoplasia can affect any age group, though it is often present from birth or early childhood in syndromic cases. It can be familial, suggesting inheritance patterns rather than age-specific occurrence[4].\n\n## Micrognathia (HP:0000347)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nMicrognathia appears in multiple genetic syndromes and can occur as an isolated feature or as part of broader craniofacial abnormalities. The search results mention underdevelopment of the lower jaw in several syndromes, including Saethre-Chotzen syndrome where most children have underdeveloped lower jaws[7].\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nMicrognathia becomes more informative when it appears alongside specific combinations of other features. For example, in Suleiman-El-Hattab syndrome, micrognathia (small head\/microcephaly) appears with a constellation of other distinctive features including synophrys, hypertelorism, and epicanthal folds[1].\n\n**Demographics:**\nThis feature is typically present from birth (congenital) in syndromic cases and does not show specific gender predilection based on the available information.\n\n## Abnormal Palate Morphology (HP:0000174)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nAbnormal palate morphology, including cleft palate, appears across multiple genetic syndromes. The search results mention cleft lip and\/or palate in Kabuki syndrome and cleft palate in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome[1][7]. This feature is relatively common across various genetic disorders.\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nSpecific palate abnormalities become more informative when combined with other syndrome-specific features. For instance, in Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, cleft palate may appear alongside craniosynostosis and syndactyly[7].\n\n**Demographics:**\nPalate abnormalities are typically congenital (present at birth) and do not show strong gender predilection based on the search results.\n\n## Hearing Impairment (HP:0000365)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nHearing loss appears in multiple genetic syndromes. The search results indicate that patients with Kabuki syndrome may have hearing loss[1], and Muenke syndrome patients should be tested for hearing loss and monitored even if initial evaluation is normal[6].\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nHearing impairment becomes more diagnostically useful when it appears as part of a specific syndrome with other characteristic features. However, as an isolated feature, it is relatively nonspecific.\n\n**Demographics:**\nHearing loss in genetic syndromes can be present from birth or develop later in life. Muenke syndrome requires ongoing monitoring for hearing loss throughout development[6], suggesting that the timing and progression of hearing loss may have diagnostic value.\n\n## Hypoplasia of the Radius (HP:0002984)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nRadial hypoplasia appears in skeletal dysplasias and some genetic syndromes. The search results do not provide extensive detail on this feature, but it appears to be less commonly mentioned than craniofacial features.\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nRadial hypoplasia becomes more informative when it appears with other skeletal abnormalities. The search results mention that Bent Bone Dysplasia Syndrome affects skeletal development, though specific radial involvement is not detailed[8].\n\n**Demographics:**\nSkeletal hypoplasias are typically congenital and present from birth. No specific gender predilection is noted in the search results.\n\n## Abnormal Thumb Morphology (HP:0001172)\n\n**Common and Less Informative:**\nAbnormal thumb morphology can appear in various genetic syndromes affecting skeletal development. The search results mention that Saethre-Chotzen syndrome includes occasional partial fusion of the second and third fingers (syndactyly)[7], which relates to digit abnormalities.\n\n**Rare and Informative:**\nThumb abnormalities become more diagnostically specific when they appear with other characteristic features. For example, specific patterns of thumb involvement combined with other hand\/foot differences can aid in syndrome identification.\n\n**Demographics:**\nThumb abnormalities in genetic syndromes are typically congenital and do not show specific gender predilection based on the available information.\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term | Specificity | Common\/Rare | Gender\/Age Association |\n|----------|-------------|------------|------------------------|\n| Slanting of palpebral fissure | Low-Moderate | Common | None noted |\n| Midface retrusion | Moderate | Common | Any age; often congenital |\n| Micrognathia | Low-Moderate | Common | Congenital; no gender predilection |\n| Abnormal palate morphology | Low | Common | Congenital; no gender predilection |\n| Hearing impairment | Low-Moderate | Common | Variable onset; requires monitoring |\n| Hypoplasia of radius | Moderate-High | Rare | Congenital; no gender predilection |\n| Abnormal thumb morphology | Moderate-High | Rare | Congenital; no gender predilection |\n\nThe most common and less informative features are **abnormal palate morphology**, **midface retrusion**, and **slanting of the palpebral fissure**, as these appear across multiple unrelated syndromes. The rarer and more informative features are **hypoplasia of the radius** and **abnormal thumb morphology**, as these skeletal findings are more specific to particular genetic conditions. Most of these features are congenital with no specific gender predilection, though some conditions like Renpenning syndrome show X-linked inheritance patterns affecting males more severely[5].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Approximately 1-3% of preschool-aged children and roughly 15-17% of children between ages 3 and 17 in the United States experience some form of developmental delay[1][3][9]. This relatively high prevalence makes GDD a broad indicator rather than a disease-specific marker. GDD serves as an umbrella diagnosis that can result from numerous underlying conditions, ranging from genetic disorders to environmental factors, making it less informative for pinpointing a specific disease etiology[1][3].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nWhile GDD itself is common, it is not rare. However, when GDD is associated with specific underlying causes—such as Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders—those particular etiologies become more informative for diagnosis[3][4]. The condition functions more as a clinical presentation rather than a disease-specific finding.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nGDD is defined specifically for **children aged 5 years and younger**[1][4]. Regarding gender, research indicates a slightly increased incidence in males, possibly due to genetic variability on the X-chromosome[5]. However, this difference is modest, and GDD affects both genders substantially. The condition is most commonly identified during infancy and early childhood when developmental milestones become apparent[1][2].\n\n## Scoliosis (HP:0002650)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nScoliosis, defined as an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine with a Cobb angle greater than 10 degrees, is a relatively common structural finding but is **non-specific regarding disease etiology**. While scoliosis can occur as an isolated condition or as a secondary feature of various underlying disorders, it is not particularly informative for identifying a specific disease on its own. Scoliosis can be idiopathic (no identifiable cause) or associated with neuromuscular conditions, connective tissue disorders, or other systemic diseases[7].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nScoliosis itself is not rare, but when it appears as part of a syndrome or genetic disorder—such as in certain forms of muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, or connective tissue disorders—it becomes more disease-specific. In these contexts, scoliosis serves as one of multiple diagnostic features that collectively point toward a particular condition rather than being diagnostic on its own.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nScoliosis shows a notable **gender predilection**, with females being significantly more likely to develop idiopathic scoliosis, particularly during adolescence. The condition most commonly manifests during growth spurts in childhood and adolescence, with peak onset between ages 10-16 years. While scoliosis can occur at any age, it is less commonly associated with infants and very young children unless it is secondary to an underlying neuromuscular or genetic condition.\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| Aspect | Global Developmental Delay | Scoliosis |\n|--------|---------------------------|----------|\n| **Commonality** | Common (1-3% GDD; 15-17% any delay) | Common but varies by type |\n| **Disease Specificity** | Low; broad indicator | Low; often secondary finding |\n| **Age Group** | Infants to 5 years | Childhood to adolescence (peak 10-16 years) |\n| **Gender Predilection** | Slight male predominance | Strong female predominance (idiopathic) |\n| **Informativeness** | More informative when linked to specific etiology | More informative when part of syndrome |","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Because it is nonspecific and can be influenced by genetics, environment, and lifestyle, it is less informative for pinpointing a specific disease[1][2][6]. | Certain specific abnormal foot morphologies (e.g., clubfoot, high-arched feet in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) are rarer and can be more informative diagnostically, especially when combined with other features[4][6]. | Some foot deformities have gender predilections; for example, clubfoot is about twice as common in boys than girls[6]. Foot morphology also varies with age and weight in children, with overweight children showing different foot structure patterns[5]. |\n| **HP:0000508 - Ptosis** | Ptosis (drooping upper eyelid) is a relatively common clinical sign that can be caused by many conditions, including aging, nerve palsies, or myopathies. Alone, it is less specific and less informative for a particular disease[general clinical knowledge]. | Ptosis is more informative when it occurs congenitally or as part of syndromes (e.g., congenital myasthenic syndromes, mitochondrial diseases). In such contexts, it is a rare and valuable diagnostic clue[general clinical knowledge]. | Ptosis can occur at any age but congenital ptosis is present at birth. No strong gender predilection is generally reported. |\n| **HP:0000347 - Micrognathia** | Micrognathia (small lower jaw) is a common feature in many genetic syndromes and congenital anomalies, making it relatively common but moderately informative depending on context[3][8]. | It is rare and highly informative when associated with syndromes like Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome, or overgrowth syndromes with mandibular hypoplasia[3][8]. | Micrognathia is congenital, thus present from birth. It is not strongly gender-specific but is often identified in pediatric populations. |\n| **HP:0001371 - Flexion contracture** | Flexion contractures are common in many musculoskeletal and neurological conditions, including arthritis and neuromuscular disorders, thus less specific and less informative alone[general clinical knowledge]. | Rare forms or specific joint contractures (e.g., in genetic syndromes or severe neuromuscular diseases) are more informative diagnostically[general clinical knowledge]. | Can occur at any age depending on the underlying cause; no strong gender predilection. |\n| **HP:0012385 - Camptodactyly** | Camptodactyly (permanent flexion of finger or toe joints) is relatively common as an isolated finding or familial trait, so less informative alone[3]. | When part of syndromes (e.g., distal arthrogryposis), it is rare and informative for diagnosis[3]. | Usually congenital or early onset; no strong gender bias reported. |\n| **HP:0005830 - Flexion contracture of toe** | Similar to flexion contracture generally, toe contractures are common in foot deformities and neuromuscular conditions, thus less specific[1][2]. | Rare and informative when associated with specific genetic syndromes or neuromuscular diseases like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease[4][5]. | May appear in childhood or adulthood depending on cause; no clear gender predilection. |\n| **HP:0030084 - Clinodactyly** | Clinodactyly (curved digit) is a common minor anomaly seen in the general population and many syndromes, so less informative alone[3]. | It is rare and more informative when part of syndromes such as Down syndrome or other chromosomal abnormalities[3]. | Present from birth; no significant gender difference. |\n\n### Additional Details:\n\n- **Abnormal foot morphology (HP:0001760)** is very broad.

Congenital ptosis or ptosis as part of syndromes is rare and informative. It can present in any age group but congenital forms are evident early.\n\n- **Micrognathia (HP:0000347)** is a developmental hypoplasia of the mandible, common in multiple syndromes and congenital anomalies. It is a key diagnostic feature in several rare syndromes and is present from birth[3][8].\n\n- **Flexion contracture (HP:0001371)** and **flexion contracture of toe (HP:0005830)** are common secondary features in many musculoskeletal and neuromuscular disorders. They are less informative alone but can be diagnostic in rare syndromes or inherited neuropathies like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which affects foot muscles and morphology[4][5].\n\n- **Camptodactyly (HP:0012385)** and **clinodactyly (HP:0030084)** are common minor anomalies.

Common vs. Less Informative**\n\nGastroparesis is relatively common in certain populations. Approximately one-third of people with diabetes develop gastroparesis, making it a frequent complication in diabetic populations[5]. However, as a diagnostic term, it is moderately informative because it describes a functional outcome (delayed gastric emptying) rather than identifying a specific underlying cause. The condition can result from multiple etiologies including diabetes, infections, medications, surgery, and post-COVID complications[2].\n\n**2. Rare and Informative Aspects**\n\nWhile gastroparesis itself is not rare in diabetic populations, certain presentations are more specific. Post-COVID gastroparesis represents a newer, more specific manifestation[2]. Additionally, gastroparesis induced by newer weight-loss medications like semaglutide represents an emerging and informative presentation[2].\n\n**3. Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nPeople assigned female at birth are more likely to develop gastroparesis than people assigned male at birth[8]. The condition can occur across age groups, though it is particularly prevalent in adults with diabetes.

Common vs. Less Informative**\n\nEsophagitis is mentioned in the search results as a potential complication of gastroparesis, specifically through gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)[1]. As a standalone term, it is relatively common but less specific for identifying gastroparesis itself, as esophagitis has multiple independent causes beyond gastroparesis.\n\n**2. Rare and Informative Aspects**\n\nWhen esophagitis occurs as a secondary complication of gastroparesis, it becomes more informative about disease progression and severity.

[1] |\n\n### Detailed Context\n\n1. **Seizure (HP:0001250)**  \n   - Defined as a transient abnormality of nervous system physiology due to excessive or synchronous neuronal activity[1].  \n   - It is a very common phenotype in many neurological diseases, including genetic epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders[3][4].  \n   - Because it is broad, it is less informative alone but essential as a foundational phenotype. Specific seizure types or patterns provide more diagnostic value[3].  \n   - Seizures frequently begin in infancy or childhood in genetic epilepsies such as those related to SCN2A or SCN8A variants[4][5].  \n\n2. **Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (HP:0002069)**  \n   - Characterized by a tonic phase (sustained muscle contraction) followed by a clonic phase (rhythmic jerking)[1].  \n   - Common in generalized epilepsy syndromes but more informative when linked to specific genetic disorders, e.g., SCN8A-related epilepsy often presents with bilateral tonic-clonic seizures in infancy[5].  \n   - No gender specificity is noted, but age of onset (infancy) is a key feature in some disorders.  \n\n3. **Clonus (HP:0002169)**  \n   - Rhythmic involuntary muscle contractions in response to stretch, often indicating neurological dysfunction[1].  \n   - Less common than seizures but informative for motor pathway involvement or certain epilepsy semiologies.  \n   - Occurs across ages without gender bias.  \n\n4. **Clumsiness (HP:0002312)**  \n   - Defined as lack of coordination leading to dropping items or bumping into objects[1].  \n   - A nonspecific but common symptom in many neurological and developmental conditions.  \n   - More informative when severe or associated with other neurological signs. Typically observed in children during motor development stages.  \n\n### Summary\n\n- **More common and less informative terms:** *Seizure* (HP:0001250) and *Clumsiness* (HP:0002312) are broad and frequent symptoms seen in many disorders.  \n- **Rare and more informative terms:** *Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure* (HP:0002069) and *Clonus* (HP:0002169) are less common and can be more specific indicators of particular neurological or genetic diseases.  \n- **Age and gender:** Seizures and related motor phenomena often present in infancy or childhood in genetic epilepsies, with no strong gender predilection documented. Clumsiness is more noted in children during development.  \n\nThis analysis is based on the HPO definitions and recent literature on genetic epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders[1][3][4][5].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

[1] |\n| **HP:0002312 Clumsiness**        | **Common and less informative:** Clumsiness is a nonspecific symptom seen in many neurological and developmental disorders. | **Rare and informative:** When severe or presenting early, it may indicate specific cerebellar or neurodevelopmental disorders. | More often noted in children during motor development; no strong gender bias. [1] |\n\n### Detailed Context\n\n1. **Seizure (HP:0001250)**  \n   - Defined as a transient abnormality of nervous system physiology due to excessive or synchronous neuronal activity[1].  \n   - It is a very common phenotype in many neurological diseases, including genetic epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders[3][4].  \n   - Because it is broad, it is less informative alone but essential as a foundational phenotype. Specific seizure types or patterns provide more diagnostic value[3].  \n   - Seizures frequently begin in infancy or childhood in genetic epilepsies such as those related to SCN2A or SCN8A variants[4][5].  \n\n2. **Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure (HP:0002069)**  \n   - Characterized by a tonic phase (sustained muscle contraction) followed by a clonic phase (rhythmic jerking)[1].  \n   - Common in generalized epilepsy syndromes but more informative when linked to specific genetic disorders, e.g., SCN8A-related epilepsy often presents with bilateral tonic-clonic seizures in infancy[5].  \n   - No gender specificity is noted, but age of onset (infancy) is a key feature in some disorders.  \n\n3. **Clonus (HP:0002169)**  \n   - Rhythmic involuntary muscle contractions in response to stretch, often indicating neurological dysfunction[1].  \n   - Less common than seizures but informative for motor pathway involvement or certain epilepsy semiologies.  \n   - Occurs across ages without gender bias.  \n\n4. **Clumsiness (HP:0002312)**  \n   - Defined as lack of coordination leading to dropping items or bumping into objects[1].  \n   - A nonspecific but common symptom in many neurological and developmental conditions.  \n   - More informative when severe or associated with other neurological signs. Typically observed in children during motor development stages.  \n\n### Summary\n\n- **More common and less informative terms:** *Seizure* (HP:0001250) and *Clumsiness* (HP:0002312) are broad and frequent symptoms seen in many disorders.  \n- **Rare and more informative terms:** *Bilateral tonic-clonic seizure* (HP:0002069) and *Clonus* (HP:0002169) are less common and can be more specific indicators of particular neurological or genetic diseases.  \n- **Age and gender:** Seizures and related motor phenomena often present in infancy or childhood in genetic epilepsies, with no strong gender predilection documented. Clumsiness is more noted in children during development.  \n\nThis analysis is based on the HPO definitions and recent literature on genetic epilepsies and neurodevelopmental disorders[1][3][4][5].\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"2, Female\nseizure, bilateral tonic-clonic seizure, clonus, clumsiness","sample_name":"NA20294"}

It provides minimal diagnostic specificity.\n\n- **Protruding ear (HP:0000411)**: Similarly, ear prominence is a common anatomical variant that occurs in many individuals without any underlying genetic condition.\n\n- **Cupped ear (HP:0000378)**: While more specific than protruding ears, cupped ears still appear in various conditions and can be a normal variant.\n\n- **Supernumerary nipple (HP:0002558)**: This occurs in approximately 0.2-5% of the population and, while unusual, is not highly specific to any particular disease.\n\n**Rare and Highly Informative Terms:**\n\n- **Micrognathia (HP:0000347)**: This is a highly informative term with significant diagnostic value. Micrognathia occurs in approximately 1 in 1,500 to 5,000 live births[1][4] and is strongly associated with specific genetic syndromes including Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome, Stickler syndrome, and others[2][4][6]. When present, micrognathia often indicates an underlying genetic condition requiring investigation.\n\n- **Orofacial cleft (HP:0000202)**: This is a rare and highly specific finding. Cleft lip and\/or palate is the most common birth defect in the United States, affecting approximately 1 in 700 babies[4]. Importantly, orofacial clefts are frequently associated with micrognathia, particularly in Pierre Robin sequence where the small jaw causes tongue displacement leading to cleft palate[1].\n\n- **Eyelid coloboma (HP:0000625)**: This is a rare and specific finding that, when present, strongly suggests particular genetic syndromes and warrants genetic evaluation.\n\n## Age and Gender Considerations\n\n**Age-Related Patterns:**\n\nThe search results indicate that most of these HPO terms present at birth or in early infancy:\n\n- **Micrognathia** is typically congenital and present at birth[5][8]. Notably, micrognathia often corrects itself during growth, with jaw growth occurring particularly between 6 and 18 months of age and again during puberty[6][8].\n\n- **Orofacial clefts** are present at birth and can sometimes be detected prenatally via ultrasound[4][8].\n\n- The other features (prominent nose, protruding ears, cupped ears, supernumerary nipple, eyelid coloboma) are generally present from birth but may become more or less apparent as the child grows.\n\n**Gender Considerations:**\n\nThe search results do not provide specific information indicating that any of these HPO terms show gender-specific prevalence patterns. Micrognathia and orofacial clefts appear to affect both males and females, though some genetic syndromes associated with these features may have sex-linked inheritance patterns not detailed in the provided search results.\n\n## Clinical Significance Summary\n\nMicrognathia and orofacial cleft are the most diagnostically valuable terms in this set, as they are relatively rare, strongly associated with specific genetic syndromes, and warrant comprehensive genetic and multidisciplinary evaluation[2][8].

Common and less informative?**  \n- **No.** A prominent nose is not a common, non-specific feature. It is a distinctive facial trait that is often associated with specific syndromes (e.g., Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism, and some progeroid syndromes).  \n- **Conclusion:** Less common, more informative.\n\n**2.

While common in infants, it is highly informative for diagnosis because it is the primary defining feature of multiple genetic syndromes. The condition is particularly significant as a diagnostic marker when it appears as part of recognized genetic conditions[2].\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\n\nMicrognathia is moderately common but becomes highly specific when associated with particular syndromes such as Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome, Stickler syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome[2][4]. In these contexts, it serves as a key diagnostic indicator.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nMicrognathia is typically congenital, present at birth[5]. It is relatively common in newborns, with a slightly recessed jaw being a normal part of infant development[5]. The condition often corrects itself between 6 and 18 months of age as children grow[8]. No gender predilection is mentioned in the search results.\n\n## HP:0000448 - Prominent Nose\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\n\nThe search results provided do not contain specific information about prominent nose in relation to micrognathia or associated syndromes.

Cleft palate frequently occurs as part of Pierre Robin sequence, where the small jaw causes tongue displacement leading to cleft palate formation[1]. Cleft lip and cleft palate are recognized genetic causes of micrognathia[4][6].\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\n\nWhile orofacial clefts are relatively common birth defects, their association with micrognathia is highly specific for certain syndromes. When micrognathia and orofacial cleft occur together, this combination is particularly informative for Pierre Robin sequence and related conditions[1][2].\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nOrofacial clefts are congenital, present at birth[1].

When micrognathia and orofacial cleft occur together, this combination is particularly informative for Pierre Robin sequence and related conditions[1][2].\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nOrofacial clefts are congenital, present at birth[1]. The search results do not specify gender predilection for this feature in the context of micrognathia.\n\n## Summary\n\nAmong the HPO terms provided, **micrognathia (HP:0000347)** and **orofacial cleft (HP:0000202)** are the most clinically relevant and informative for diagnosing micrognathia-related conditions. The remaining terms (prominent nose, protruding ear, cupped ear, supernumerary nipple, and eyelid coloboma) are not specifically addressed in the clinical literature regarding micrognathia and do not appear to be characteristic features of this condition or its associated syndromes.\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"0, Female\nmicrognathia, orofacial cleft","sample_name":"HG01402"}

It is **less informative for specific disease diagnosis** because it can occur as a normal variation or as part of numerous genetic syndromes. The search results show it appearing in conditions like Burn-McKeown syndrome, but it is not a distinguishing feature.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nThis term is not rare and has limited specificity. While it may be noted in clinical descriptions, it does not point to a particular disease without additional clinical features.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nNo specific gender or age predilection is documented for prominent nose as an isolated feature. It can be present from birth as a congenital feature or develop during normal growth and development.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000378 - Cupped Ear\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nCupped ear is a **moderately specific congenital ear deformity** that is less common than some other ear abnormalities but still relatively non-specific when appearing alone. It is present at birth and can range from mild to severe[1]. While it appears in various genetic syndromes, it is not pathognomonic (uniquely characteristic) of any single condition.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nCupped ears have moderate specificity and appear in several rare genetic syndromes, including Auriculocondylar syndrome, where they are documented as one of several ear abnormalities[9]. In severe cases, cupped ears may be accompanied by inner ear anomalies affecting hearing[1]. The condition is congenital but can occur as an isolated finding or as part of a syndrome.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nCupped ears are present from birth with no documented gender predilection. Early intervention through ear molding in the first few weeks of life, when cartilage is still pliable, can prevent the need for later surgical correction[3][5].\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000411 - Protruding Ear\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nProtruding ear (also called prominent ear) is a **common congenital ear deformity that is primarily cosmetic** and relatively non-specific for disease diagnosis. It is one of the most frequently encountered ear abnormalities and appears across many conditions and in the general population. This makes it **less informative for identifying specific diseases** when it appears as an isolated feature.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nProtruding ears are not rare and have limited disease specificity. However, when combined with other clinical features, they may contribute to the recognition of specific syndromes. The search results indicate protruding ears appear in multiple conditions but are not distinctive markers.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nProtruding ears are present from birth with no documented gender predilection. They are amenable to early nonsurgical treatment through ear molding during the first weeks of life[3][5], and surgical correction is typically recommended after school age.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000202 - Orofacial Cleft\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nOrofacial cleft (cleft lip and\/or palate) is a **relatively common birth defect** but has moderate specificity because it appears in numerous genetic syndromes and can also occur as an isolated finding. While not highly specific for a single disease, it is an important clinical feature that narrows the differential diagnosis when present with other features.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nOrofacial clefts are not rare in the general population but are highly informative when they occur as part of a syndrome. The search results show cleft palate appearing in multiple rare syndromes including Abruzzo-Erickson syndrome, Burn-McKeown syndrome, and Auriculocondylar syndrome[2][4][9]. When combined with other features like hearing loss, cardiac defects, or ear abnormalities, orofacial clefts become more diagnostically specific.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nOrofacial clefts are present from birth. There is a slight male predominance for cleft lip with or without palate, while isolated cleft palate shows a slight female predominance. These are congenital features identified at birth during physical examination.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000347 - Micrognathia\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nMicrognathia (small lower jaw) is a **moderately specific feature** that is more informative than isolated prominent nose or protruding ears. It appears in several genetic syndromes and can have significant functional consequences, particularly affecting breathing and feeding. This makes it more diagnostically relevant.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nMicrognathia has moderate to high specificity when present. The search results show it as a hallmark feature of Auriculocondylar syndrome, where underdevelopment of the mandibular condyle causes functional problems with the temporomandibular joint[9]. It also appears in other rare syndromes. When micrognathia is severe, it often causes breathing difficulties requiring intervention in infants.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nMicrognathia is a congenital feature present from birth with no documented gender predilection. It is particularly significant in neonates and infants, where severe cases may necessitate a breathing tube due to airway obstruction[9]. The condition may improve somewhat with age as the child grows, but functional limitations may persist.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000625 - Eyelid Coloboma\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nEyelid coloboma is a **rare and relatively specific eye abnormality** that is more informative for disease diagnosis than common features like prominent nose. A coloboma represents a full-thickness defect or notch in the eyelid margin, making it a distinctive structural abnormality.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nEyelid coloboma is rare and has higher specificity for genetic syndromes. The search results show it appearing in rare conditions like Burn-McKeown syndrome and Abruzzo-Erickson syndrome (where iris coloboma is noted)[2][4]. When eyelid coloboma is present, it significantly narrows the differential diagnosis and points toward specific rare genetic conditions.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nEyelid coloboma is a congenital feature present from birth with no documented gender predilection. It is identified during physical examination at birth or in early infancy and may require surgical correction depending on severity and functional impact.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0002558 - Supernumerary Nipple\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nSupernumerary nipple (accessory nipple) is a **relatively common anatomical variation** that is **less informative for specific disease diagnosis**. It occurs in a significant proportion of the general population and is often considered a minor anatomical variant rather than a pathological finding.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nSupernumerary nipples are not rare and have very limited disease specificity. While they may be noted in clinical descriptions, they do not point to any particular genetic syndrome or disease. This feature has minimal diagnostic value when appearing alone.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nSupernumerary nipples are present from birth with no documented gender predilection. They are typically identified during physical examination in infancy or early childhood and are usually considered cosmetically insignificant, requiring no treatment in most cases.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Disease Specificity | Diagnostic Value |\n|----------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Prominent Nose | Common | Low | Low |\n| Cupped Ear | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |\n| Protruding Ear | Common | Low | Low |\n| Orofacial Cleft | Moderate | Moderate-High | Moderate-High |\n| Micrognathia | Moderate | Moderate-High | Moderate-High |\n| Eyelid Coloboma | Rare | High | High |\n| Supernumerary Nipple | Common | Very Low | Very Low |\n\n**Most Informative Features:** Eyelid coloboma and micrognathia have the highest diagnostic specificity, particularly when appearing in combination with other clinical features in rare genetic syndromes. **Least Informative Features:** Prominent nose and supernumerary nipple are common variations with minimal disease-specific diagnostic value.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

It is one of the most frequently encountered ear abnormalities and appears across many conditions and in the general population. This makes it **less informative for identifying specific diseases** when it appears as an isolated feature.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nProtruding ears are not rare and have limited disease specificity. However, when combined with other clinical features, they may contribute to the recognition of specific syndromes. The search results indicate protruding ears appear in multiple conditions but are not distinctive markers.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nProtruding ears are present from birth with no documented gender predilection. They are amenable to early nonsurgical treatment through ear molding during the first weeks of life[3][5], and surgical correction is typically recommended after school age.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000202 - Orofacial Cleft\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nOrofacial cleft (cleft lip and\/or palate) is a **relatively common birth defect** but has moderate specificity because it appears in numerous genetic syndromes and can also occur as an isolated finding. While not highly specific for a single disease, it is an important clinical feature that narrows the differential diagnosis when present with other features.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nOrofacial clefts are not rare in the general population but are highly informative when they occur as part of a syndrome. The search results show cleft palate appearing in multiple rare syndromes including Abruzzo-Erickson syndrome, Burn-McKeown syndrome, and Auriculocondylar syndrome[2][4][9]. When combined with other features like hearing loss, cardiac defects, or ear abnormalities, orofacial clefts become more diagnostically specific.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nOrofacial clefts are present from birth. There is a slight male predominance for cleft lip with or without palate, while isolated cleft palate shows a slight female predominance. These are congenital features identified at birth during physical examination.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000347 - Micrognathia\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nMicrognathia (small lower jaw) is a **moderately specific feature** that is more informative than isolated prominent nose or protruding ears. It appears in several genetic syndromes and can have significant functional consequences, particularly affecting breathing and feeding. This makes it more diagnostically relevant.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nMicrognathia has moderate to high specificity when present. The search results show it as a hallmark feature of Auriculocondylar syndrome, where underdevelopment of the mandibular condyle causes functional problems with the temporomandibular joint[9]. It also appears in other rare syndromes. When micrognathia is severe, it often causes breathing difficulties requiring intervention in infants.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nMicrognathia is a congenital feature present from birth with no documented gender predilection. It is particularly significant in neonates and infants, where severe cases may necessitate a breathing tube due to airway obstruction[9]. The condition may improve somewhat with age as the child grows, but functional limitations may persist.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000625 - Eyelid Coloboma\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nEyelid coloboma is a **rare and relatively specific eye abnormality** that is more informative for disease diagnosis than common features like prominent nose. A coloboma represents a full-thickness defect or notch in the eyelid margin, making it a distinctive structural abnormality.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nEyelid coloboma is rare and has higher specificity for genetic syndromes. The search results show it appearing in rare conditions like Burn-McKeown syndrome and Abruzzo-Erickson syndrome (where iris coloboma is noted)[2][4]. When eyelid coloboma is present, it significantly narrows the differential diagnosis and points toward specific rare genetic conditions.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nEyelid coloboma is a congenital feature present from birth with no documented gender predilection. It is identified during physical examination at birth or in early infancy and may require surgical correction depending on severity and functional impact.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0002558 - Supernumerary Nipple\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nSupernumerary nipple (accessory nipple) is a **relatively common anatomical variation** that is **less informative for specific disease diagnosis**. It occurs in a significant proportion of the general population and is often considered a minor anatomical variant rather than a pathological finding.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nSupernumerary nipples are not rare and have very limited disease specificity. While they may be noted in clinical descriptions, they do not point to any particular genetic syndrome or disease. This feature has minimal diagnostic value when appearing alone.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nSupernumerary nipples are present from birth with no documented gender predilection. They are typically identified during physical examination in infancy or early childhood and are usually considered cosmetically insignificant, requiring no treatment in most cases.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Disease Specificity | Diagnostic Value |\n|----------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Prominent Nose | Common | Low | Low |\n| Cupped Ear | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |\n| Protruding Ear | Common | Low | Low |\n| Orofacial Cleft | Moderate | Moderate-High | Moderate-High |\n| Micrognathia | Moderate | Moderate-High | Moderate-High |\n| Eyelid Coloboma | Rare | High | High |\n| Supernumerary Nipple | Common | Very Low | Very Low |\n\n**Most Informative Features:** Eyelid coloboma and micrognathia have the highest diagnostic specificity, particularly when appearing in combination with other clinical features in rare genetic syndromes. **Least Informative Features:** Prominent nose and supernumerary nipple are common variations with minimal disease-specific diagnostic value.\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"3, Female\nProminent Nose, Cupped Ear, Protruding Ear, Orofacial Cleft, Micrognathia, Eyelid Coloboma, Supernumerary Nipple","sample_name":"HG00544"}

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms: Intellectual Disability, Seizures, and Autism\n\n## HP:0010864 - Intellectual Disability, Severe\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nSevere intellectual disability is a relatively common condition within the broader spectrum of intellectual disabilities, though it represents the more severe end of the spectrum. Intellectual disability overall affects approximately 1% of the population[5], with severe cases being less common than mild or moderate cases. As a diagnostic term, severe intellectual disability is moderately informative because it indicates significant cognitive impairment (IQ 20-34) and substantial limitations in adaptive functioning, but it does not specify the underlying etiology. Many different genetic and environmental causes can result in severe intellectual disability, including Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and various prenatal or perinatal complications[1][3].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nWhile severe intellectual disability itself is not rare, it is less specific than many other HPO terms because it describes a symptom severity level rather than a specific disease mechanism. The condition can result from numerous distinct genetic disorders and environmental factors[7], making it a non-specific marker that requires additional diagnostic investigation to determine the underlying cause.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nIntellectual disability is slightly more common in males than females[9]. The condition must manifest before age 22 to meet diagnostic criteria[2][3]. Severe intellectual disability is typically identified during infancy and early childhood when developmental delays become apparent, as affected individuals show significant delays in reaching developmental milestones such as sitting, walking, and speaking[5][6].\n\n## HP:0001250 - Seizure\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nSeizures are a relatively common co-occurring condition in individuals with intellectual disabilities. Epilepsy frequently co-occurs with intellectual disability[2], making seizures a moderately common feature in this population. However, seizures are not specific to intellectual disability—they can occur in many neurological conditions and even in individuals without intellectual disability. As a diagnostic term, seizures are moderately informative because they indicate abnormal neuronal activity in the brain, but they do not specify the underlying cause or the primary condition. Seizures can result from genetic epilepsy syndromes, brain malformations, infections, traumatic brain injury, or metabolic disorders[7].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nSeizures are not rare in the general population, but certain types of seizures and seizure syndromes can be quite specific to particular genetic disorders. For example, specific seizure patterns may be characteristic of certain genetic conditions like Rett syndrome or specific epilepsy syndromes. However, as a general HPO term, \"seizure\" is less disease-specific than more detailed seizure phenotypes.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nSeizures can occur at any age, though the onset and type vary depending on the underlying cause. Some seizure disorders are more common in childhood, while others may manifest later. There is no strong gender predilection for seizures in general, though some specific genetic epilepsy syndromes may show sex-linked inheritance patterns[7].\n\n## HP:0000717 - Autism\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is a common neurodevelopmental condition that frequently co-occurs with intellectual disability[2]. Autism is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, along with restricted and repetitive behaviors. As a diagnostic term, autism is moderately informative because it identifies a specific neurodevelopmental phenotype, but it does not specify the underlying genetic or environmental cause. Autism can occur as an independent condition or as part of various genetic syndromes (such as Fragile X syndrome or Rett syndrome) that also cause intellectual disability[1].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is relatively common in the population and is not considered rare. However, when autism co-occurs with severe intellectual disability, this combination may be more specific to certain genetic disorders. The presence of autism alongside severe intellectual disability can help narrow the differential diagnosis toward specific genetic syndromes.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nAutism is diagnosed more frequently in males than females, though this may partly reflect diagnostic bias[2]. Autism begins in childhood and is typically identified during early developmental periods, though diagnosis can occur at any age. The condition manifests during the developmental period before age 22, consistent with the diagnostic criteria for developmental disorders[2][3].\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Disease Specificity | Gender Bias | Age of Onset |\n|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Severe Intellectual Disability | Moderate (less common than mild\/moderate ID) | Low (multiple etiologies) | Slightly more common in males | Infancy to early childhood |\n| Seizure | Moderate to High | Low (many causes) | No strong bias | Variable (often childhood) |\n| Autism | Moderate to High | Moderate (specific phenotype) | More common in males | Early childhood |\n\nThe most disease-specific of these three terms is autism, as it describes a particular neurodevelopmental phenotype. Seizures and severe intellectual disability are less specific, as they can result from numerous different underlying causes and are more appropriately considered as features that require further investigation to determine the primary etiology.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Which of these HPO terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n\n- **Abnormal facial shape (HP:0001999)** is a **common and less specific feature** seen in many genetic syndromes and disorders involving craniofacial development. It is frequently reported in syndromes such as Treacher-Collins syndrome and various neurodevelopmental disorders but is generally considered a broad and nonspecific descriptor because many diseases can present with some form of facial dysmorphism[4][5].\n\n- **Global developmental delay (HP:0001263)** is also a **common and broad term** describing delayed achievement of developmental milestones in children under five years. It is a frequent feature in a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders, genetic syndromes, and metabolic conditions, making it less informative for pinpointing a specific disease without additional context[2][3].\n\n- **Atypical behavior (HP:0000708)** is a **common but somewhat less specific term** that encompasses a wide range of behavioral abnormalities that can be modulated by the individual's will. It is frequently reported in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders but is generally nonspecific because it covers diverse behavioral symptoms[3].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Which of these HPO terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n\n- None of these three terms are inherently rare by themselves; however, **when combined with other specific phenotypic features or genetic findings**, they can become informative for diagnosing particular rare diseases.\n\n- For example, **facial dysmorphism (abnormal facial shape)** combined with specific patterns of other anomalies (e.g., oculo-auriculo abnormalities, genitourinary defects) can indicate rare syndromes such as the novel neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by biallelic *CACHD1* variants[1] or MGA-related syndrome with distinctive facial and developmental features[2].\n\n- **Global developmental delay** is a key informative feature in rare syndromes like Hogue-Janssens Syndrome 1, which also includes intellectual disability, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features[3].\n\n- **Atypical behavior** can be informative when it is part of a constellation of symptoms in rare genetic syndromes involving neurodevelopmental and psychiatric manifestations, such as those described in Hogue-Janssens Syndrome 1[3].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Is there a specific gender or age group more likely to have these HPO terms?\n\n- **Abnormal facial shape (HP:0001999)** is not generally gender-specific and can present at any age, often recognized early in life during clinical genetic evaluation or pediatric assessment[4][5].\n\n- **Global developmental delay (HP:0001263)** specifically applies to **children younger than five years old**, as it describes delays in early developmental milestones. It is not gender-specific but is primarily a pediatric concern[2][3].\n\n- **Atypical behavior (HP:0000708)** can occur at any age but is often noted in childhood or adolescence when behavioral patterns become more apparent. There is no strong gender predilection, though some behavioral disorders may show gender biases depending on the underlying condition[3].\n\n---\n\n### Additional context from search results:\n\n- The **novel neurodevelopmental syndrome with facial dysmorphism** caused by *CACHD1* loss-of-function variants illustrates how abnormal facial shape and developmental delay can co-occur in a rare disease context, with multisystem involvement and early neurodevelopmental impact[1].\n\n- The **MGA-related syndrome** also highlights the combination of developmental delay and distinctive facial dysmorphisms, along with other congenital anomalies, emphasizing the importance of detailed phenotyping for diagnosis[2].\n\n- **Hogue-Janssens Syndrome 1** is a rare genetic disorder characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, atypical facial features, and behavioral abnormalities, illustrating how these HPO terms cluster in specific rare conditions[3].\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| HPO Term               | Commonality           | Informative for Specific Disease?          | Age\/Gender Specificity                     |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Abnormal facial shape  | Common, less specific | Informative when combined with other signs | Any age, no gender bias                     |\n| Global developmental delay | Common, less specific | Informative in pediatric rare syndromes    | Children <5 years, no gender bias           |\n| Atypical behavior      | Common, less specific | Informative in neurodevelopmental syndromes| Any age (often childhood\/adolescence), no strong gender bias |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on the phenotypic descriptions and genetic findings from recent studies and databases on rare genetic syndromes[1][2][3][4][5].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

It is frequently reported in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders but is generally nonspecific because it covers diverse behavioral symptoms[3].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Which of these HPO terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n\n- None of these three terms are inherently rare by themselves; however, **when combined with other specific phenotypic features or genetic findings**, they can become informative for diagnosing particular rare diseases.\n\n- For example, **facial dysmorphism (abnormal facial shape)** combined with specific patterns of other anomalies (e.g., oculo-auriculo abnormalities, genitourinary defects) can indicate rare syndromes such as the novel neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by biallelic *CACHD1* variants[1] or MGA-related syndrome with distinctive facial and developmental features[2].\n\n- **Global developmental delay** is a key informative feature in rare syndromes like Hogue-Janssens Syndrome 1, which also includes intellectual disability, hypotonia, and dysmorphic features[3].\n\n- **Atypical behavior** can be informative when it is part of a constellation of symptoms in rare genetic syndromes involving neurodevelopmental and psychiatric manifestations, such as those described in Hogue-Janssens Syndrome 1[3].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Is there a specific gender or age group more likely to have these HPO terms?\n\n- **Abnormal facial shape (HP:0001999)** is not generally gender-specific and can present at any age, often recognized early in life during clinical genetic evaluation or pediatric assessment[4][5].\n\n- **Global developmental delay (HP:0001263)** specifically applies to **children younger than five years old**, as it describes delays in early developmental milestones. It is not gender-specific but is primarily a pediatric concern[2][3].\n\n- **Atypical behavior (HP:0000708)** can occur at any age but is often noted in childhood or adolescence when behavioral patterns become more apparent. There is no strong gender predilection, though some behavioral disorders may show gender biases depending on the underlying condition[3].\n\n---\n\n### Additional context from search results:\n\n- The **novel neurodevelopmental syndrome with facial dysmorphism** caused by *CACHD1* loss-of-function variants illustrates how abnormal facial shape and developmental delay can co-occur in a rare disease context, with multisystem involvement and early neurodevelopmental impact[1].\n\n- The **MGA-related syndrome** also highlights the combination of developmental delay and distinctive facial dysmorphisms, along with other congenital anomalies, emphasizing the importance of detailed phenotyping for diagnosis[2].\n\n- **Hogue-Janssens Syndrome 1** is a rare genetic disorder characterized by global developmental delay, intellectual disability, hypotonia, atypical facial features, and behavioral abnormalities, illustrating how these HPO terms cluster in specific rare conditions[3].\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| HPO Term               | Commonality           | Informative for Specific Disease?          | Age\/Gender Specificity                     |\n|-----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Abnormal facial shape  | Common, less specific | Informative when combined with other signs | Any age, no gender bias                     |\n| Global developmental delay | Common, less specific | Informative in pediatric rare syndromes    | Children <5 years, no gender bias           |\n| Atypical behavior      | Common, less specific | Informative in neurodevelopmental syndromes| Any age (often childhood\/adolescence), no strong gender bias |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on the phenotypic descriptions and genetic findings from recent studies and databases on rare genetic syndromes[1][2][3][4][5].\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"3, Female\nabnormal facial shape, global developmental delay, atypical behavior","sample_name":"HG01405"}

SGA occurs in approximately 5-13% of live births depending on the population studied (e.g., 5.3% in China in 2020, 6.7% in Mexico, 12.28% in Guangdong Province, China)[1][5][7]. Because it is a frequent finding influenced by many maternal and environmental factors, it is less informative by itself for diagnosing a specific genetic or rare disease.\n\n2. **Rare and informative terms for specific diseases:**\n   - While SGA itself is common, when it occurs as part of a syndrome or with additional clinical features (e.g., genetic abnormalities, epigenetic disorders), it becomes more informative. For example, children born SGA with persistent short stature or other developmental abnormalities may indicate underlying fetal growth restriction due to genetic or placental causes[4]. SGA combined with other phenotypes can thus be a useful diagnostic clue in rare diseases involving fetal growth restriction or syndromic conditions.\n\n3. **Specific gender or age group more likely to have SGA:**\n   - SGA affects newborns at birth, by definition, so the age group is neonates and infants.\n   - Females tend to have a slightly higher prevalence of SGA compared to males when using sex-specific growth references, as shown in studies from China, Nepal, and India[3][7]. This sex difference is attributed to biological growth patterns and reference population differences.\n   - Maternal factors such as younger or older maternal age, lower maternal education, primiparity, poor prenatal care, and maternal diseases increase the risk of SGA infants[1][5][6].\n   - SGA is more common in term infants than preterm infants in some populations, but preterm SGA infants have higher mortality risk[3][7].\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Question | Answer for HP:0001518 \"Small for gestational age\" |\n|---|---|\n| 1.

SGA occurs in approximately 5-13% of live births depending on the population studied (e.g., 5.3% in China in 2020, 6.7% in Mexico, 12.28% in Guangdong Province, China)[1][5][7]. Because it is a frequent finding influenced by many maternal and environmental factors, it is less informative by itself for diagnosing a specific genetic or rare disease.\n\n2. **Rare and informative terms for specific diseases:**\n   - While SGA itself is common, when it occurs as part of a syndrome or with additional clinical features (e.g., genetic abnormalities, epigenetic disorders), it becomes more informative. For example, children born SGA with persistent short stature or other developmental abnormalities may indicate underlying fetal growth restriction due to genetic or placental causes[4]. SGA combined with other phenotypes can thus be a useful diagnostic clue in rare diseases involving fetal growth restriction or syndromic conditions.\n\n3. **Specific gender or age group more likely to have SGA:**\n   - SGA affects newborns at birth, by definition, so the age group is neonates and infants.\n   - Females tend to have a slightly higher prevalence of SGA compared to males when using sex-specific growth references, as shown in studies from China, Nepal, and India[3][7].

For example, contractures occur in 15% to 70% of older adults, 60% of stroke patients, 36% of cerebral palsy patients, and 11-48% of spinal cord injury patients[1][3][5].

Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that appear as soft, skin-colored papules or small subcutaneous nodules.[1] This term is directly diagnostic of neurofibromatosis, as the presence of neurofibromas is a defining characteristic of the condition. While neurofibromas can occur as isolated lesions, multiple neurofibromas are pathognomonic for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).[9]\n\n**Prevalence and Demographics**\n\nNeurofibromas typically develop early in life, with symptoms often present at birth or developing during childhood.[9] The condition affects approximately 1 in 3,000 to 4,000 people worldwide.[10] There is no gender predilection mentioned in the search results, suggesting equal prevalence across sexes. Children with neurofibromatosis often require regular medical evaluations to monitor growth and examine skin for the development of neurofibromas.[3]\n\n---\n\n## HP:0002664 - Neoplasm\n\n**Specificity and Informativeness**\n\nNeoplasm is a general, non-specific term referring to any uncontrolled autonomous cell proliferation that can occur anywhere in the body as either benign or malignant tumors.[2] This term is **less informative and more common** across numerous diseases and conditions. While neurofibromas are indeed neoplasms, using this term alone provides minimal diagnostic value for identifying neurofibromatosis specifically, as neoplasms encompass cancers, benign tumors, and many other conditions unrelated to neurofibromatosis.\n\n**Prevalence and Demographics**\n\nNeoplasms occur across all age groups and genders depending on the specific type.

Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors that appear as soft, skin-colored papules or small subcutaneous nodules.[1] This term is directly diagnostic of neurofibromatosis, as the presence of neurofibromas is a defining characteristic of the condition. While neurofibromas can occur as isolated lesions, multiple neurofibromas are pathognomonic for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).[9]\n\n**Prevalence and Demographics**\n\nNeurofibromas typically develop early in life, with symptoms often present at birth or developing during childhood.[9] The condition affects approximately 1 in 3,000 to 4,000 people worldwide.[10] There is no gender predilection mentioned in the search results, suggesting equal prevalence across sexes. Children with neurofibromatosis often require regular medical evaluations to monitor growth and examine skin for the development of neurofibromas.[3]\n\n---\n\n## HP:0002664 - Neoplasm\n\n**Specificity and Informativeness**\n\nNeoplasm is a general, non-specific term referring to any uncontrolled autonomous cell proliferation that can occur anywhere in the body as either benign or malignant tumors.[2] This term is **less informative and more common** across numerous diseases and conditions. While neurofibromas are indeed neoplasms, using this term alone provides minimal diagnostic value for identifying neurofibromatosis specifically, as neoplasms encompass cancers, benign tumors, and many other conditions unrelated to neurofibromatosis.\n\n**Prevalence and Demographics**\n\nNeoplasms occur across all age groups and genders depending on the specific type. This term is too broad to provide meaningful demographic information regarding neurofibromatosis.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0009589 - Bilateral Vestibular Schwannoma\n\n**Specificity and Informativeness**\n\nBilateral vestibular schwannomas (acoustic neuromas) are highly specific and informative for **neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)**.[9] This finding is pathognomonic for NF2, making it one of the most diagnostically valuable terms.

Long, slender fingers are often simply a normal variation in human anatomy and are not necessarily indicative of disease[1]. However, when arachnodactyly appears alongside other clinical features, it becomes more informative for diagnosis.\n\n**Rare and Disease-Specific Presentations**\n\nWhen arachnodactyly occurs as part of a broader clinical picture, it becomes highly informative for specific genetic connective tissue disorders[2]. The most notable conditions include Marfan syndrome[4], congenital contractural arachnodactyly (Beals syndrome)[3][5], homocystinuria, and Loeys-Dietz syndrome[3]. In these contexts, arachnodactyly serves as a key diagnostic feature alongside other skeletal and systemic manifestations.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nThere is no gender predisposition for arachnodactyly itself[1][2]. However, the underlying genetic disorders that cause arachnodactyly follow autosomal dominant inheritance patterns[4][5], meaning both males and females are equally affected. Regarding age, arachnodactyly may be present at birth or become more evident over time in children[1]. In conditions like Marfan syndrome, symptoms may not fully develop until the teenage years[4].\n\n## Crumpled Ear (HP:0009901)\n\n**Common vs. Informative**\n\nCrumpled ears are not a common feature in the general population. When they do occur, they are relatively specific indicators of underlying genetic disorders rather than isolated anatomical variations.\n\n**Rare and Disease-Specific Presentations**\n\nCrumpled ears are a characteristic feature of congenital contractural arachnodactyly (Beals syndrome)[3][5][6]. This distinctive ear appearance, described as having an abnormal pinnae with a \"crumpled\" appearance, is one of the diagnostic criteria for this rare genetic disorder[5][6]. The presence of crumpled ears in combination with other skeletal features makes this finding highly informative for CCA diagnosis.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nCrumpled ears, as a feature of congenital contractural arachnodactyly, are present from birth[3][5].

However, when it appears alongside other skeletal abnormalities, it becomes more informative for diagnosis of specific genetic syndromes.\n\n**Rare and Disease-Specific Presentations**\n\nMetatarsus adductus is a recognized feature of congenital contractural arachnodactyly[3][5] and Loeys-Dietz syndrome[3]. In these rare genetic disorders, the foot deformity appears as part of a constellation of skeletal features including arachnodactyly, joint contractures, and other musculoskeletal abnormalities. When metatarsus adductus occurs alongside these other features, it becomes highly informative for these specific connective tissue disorders.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nMetatarsus adductus, as a congenital feature of genetic disorders, is present from birth[3][5].

Autism (HP:0000717)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  Autism is a relatively common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, communication, and restricted repetitive behaviors. It is a broad diagnosis and often less specific for pinpointing a particular disease because it can be present in many genetic and environmental conditions[1].\n\n- **Rarity and Informativeness:**\n  Autism itself is not rare, but its presence alongside specific neurological anomalies (e.g., corpus callosum hypoplasia or agenesis) can be highly informative for identifying syndromic or genetic causes of autism[1][3][7].\n\n- **Gender and Age Group:**\n  Autism typically begins in childhood and is more commonly diagnosed in males than females, although females may be underdiagnosed due to different symptom presentations[1]. The disorder manifests early, often before age 3.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Hypoplasia of the Corpus Callosum (HP:0002079)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum (underdevelopment of the corpus callosum) is less common than autism and is considered a more *informative* finding for specific neurological or genetic diseases. It is often associated with developmental delays, seizures, and cognitive impairments[2][6].\n\n- **Rarity and Informativeness:**\n  It is a rare condition and highly informative diagnostically because it points to underlying brain malformations or genetic syndromes. It is often detected via MRI and can co-occur with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with about a third of individuals with corpus callosum agenesis showing autistic features[1][3][7].\n\n- **Gender and Age Group:**\n  This condition is congenital (present from birth) and typically identified in infancy or early childhood during developmental assessments or imaging for delays or seizures[2][6]. There is no strong gender bias reported, but it is often diagnosed in children due to developmental concerns.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Spasticity (HP:0001257)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  Spasticity (velocity-dependent increased muscle tone and reflexes) is a common motor symptom seen in many neurological disorders, including cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. It is less specific and thus less informative for diagnosing a particular disease unless combined with other signs[ ].\n\n- **Rarity and Informativeness:**\n  Spasticity itself is not rare but is informative when present in specific patterns or with other neurological signs. It can indicate upper motor neuron lesions or neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\n- **Gender and Age Group:**\n  Spasticity can occur at any age but is often noted in children with cerebral palsy or adults after neurological injury. There is no specific gender predisposition.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Hypotonia (HP:0001252)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  Hypotonia (low muscle tone) is a common clinical finding in many pediatric neurological and genetic disorders. It is less specific alone but informative when combined with other features to narrow down diagnoses[6][10].\n\n- **Rarity and Informativeness:**\n  While hypotonia is common in various conditions, its presence with corpus callosum abnormalities or developmental delays can be more diagnostically informative[2][6].\n\n- **Gender and Age Group:**\n  Hypotonia is typically identified in infancy or early childhood, often during developmental evaluations. It affects both genders equally.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                          | Commonality              | Informativeness for Specific Disease         | Typical Age Group           | Gender Predilection           |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| **Autism (HP:0000717)**           | Common                  | Less informative alone; more informative with specific neurological findings | Childhood onset              | More common in males          |\n| **Hypoplasia of corpus callosum (HP:0002079)** | Rare                    | Highly informative for genetic\/neurological syndromes | Congenital, infancy\/early childhood | No strong gender bias         |\n| **Spasticity (HP:0001257)**       | Common                  | Less specific alone; informative in context of neurological disease | Any age, often children\/adults with CNS injury | No gender bias                |\n| **Hypotonia (HP:0001252)**        | Common                  | Less specific alone; informative with other signs | Infancy\/early childhood      | No gender bias                |\n\n---\n\n### Additional Context\n\n- **Autism and Corpus Callosum Hypoplasia:** Studies show a significant association between autism and corpus callosum hypoplasia or agenesis, with autistic individuals exhibiting reduced corpus callosum size and axonal deficits[1][3][5][7]. This suggests that corpus callosum abnormalities are a risk factor for autism and can help differentiate subtypes of autism.\n\n- **Hypoplasia of the Corpus Callosum Symptoms:** Children may have developmental delays, motor coordination difficulties, seizures, sensory sensitivities, and social challenges[2][6].\n\n- **Spasticity and Hypotonia:** Both are motor tone abnormalities but with opposite characteristics; spasticity is increased tone and reflexes, hypotonia is decreased tone. Both can co-exist in complex neurological conditions[6][8].\n\n- **Age and Gender:** Autism is diagnosed mostly in early childhood with a male predominance. Corpus callosum hypoplasia and hypotonia are congenital or early onset conditions with no clear gender bias. Spasticity can appear at any age depending on the underlying cause.\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on the latest research and clinical descriptions from authoritative sources including PMC articles, rare disease databases, and clinical neurology foundations[1][2][3][6][7][8][10].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Which HPO terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n\n- **Abnormality of the ear (HP:0000598)** is a very broad and common term describing any ear abnormality.

It is informative because it can occur as an isolated defect or as part of syndromes such as Adams-Oliver syndrome or scalp-ear-nipple syndrome[8][11].\n\n- **Absent nipple (Athelia)** is also *rare* and informative, especially when associated with syndromes like Poland syndrome, ectodermal dysplasia, Yunis-Varon syndrome, and scalp-ear-nipple syndrome[2][4][8]. The absence of nipples can help narrow down diagnoses involving ectodermal or developmental defects.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Which of these HPO terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n\n- **Abnormality of the ear (HP:0000598)** is a broad and relatively common phenotypic abnormality that can be seen in many genetic and non-genetic conditions.

It is more specific than \"abnormality of the ear\" but still can be part of multiple conditions, so it is **moderately informative**.\n\n- **Aplasia cutis congenita (HP:0001057)** is a **rare and specific congenital defect** characterized by localized absence of skin, most commonly on the scalp. It is **more informative** for diagnosis because it is a distinctive and uncommon finding often associated with particular syndromes or isolated defects.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Which of these HPO terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n\n- **Absent nipple (Athelia)** is a **rare congenital anomaly** that is informative for specific syndromes such as Poland syndrome, ectodermal dysplasia, Yunis-Varon syndrome, and scalp-ear-nipple syndrome.

While it can occur in isolation, it is most informative when associated with underlying genetic syndromes. The condition itself is uncommon enough that its presence warrants investigation into potential systemic disorders[1].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nAthelia is highly specific for certain genetic conditions and is considered a **rare, congenital condition**[3]. Its presence is particularly informative for identifying:\n- Poland syndrome (Poland sequence)[1][3]\n- Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia[3]\n- Yunis-Varon syndrome[3]\n- Scalp-ear-nipple syndrome[1]\n- Al-Awadi-Rass-Rothschild syndrome[1]\n\nThe rarity of this finding makes it a valuable diagnostic marker when present[1].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nAthelia is a **congenital condition present at birth**[1][3]. Regarding gender distribution, Poland syndrome (the most common cause of unilateral athelia) is **more common in boys than girls**, while ectodermal dysplasia affects males and females equally[1].

While it can occur as an isolated finding (nonsyndromic), it is also associated with multiple syndromes, making it **moderately informative** depending on context. As an isolated finding, it is less specific; however, when multiple lesions are present or when associated with other abnormalities, it becomes more diagnostically significant[12].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nAplasia cutis congenita is **rare and can be highly informative** when it appears as part of syndromic presentations[12]. It is particularly informative when associated with:\n- Johanson-Blizzard syndrome[12]\n- Adams-Oliver syndrome[12]\n\nThe condition can occur in isolation (nonsyndromic form) or as a secondary characteristic of other disorders[2]. When multiple lesions are present or when underlying tissues are affected, it becomes more specific for certain genetic conditions[10].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nAplasia cutis congenita is a **congenital condition present at birth**[8][10]. There is **no gender predilection mentioned** in the literature—it affects both males and females equally. The condition is diagnosed at birth when babies are born with characteristic skin defects[6][10]. Approximately 500 cases have been reported worldwide, indicating its rarity[4].\n\n---\n\n## Abnormality of the Ear (HP:0000598)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nAbnormality of the ear is a **common finding** across many genetic and developmental conditions, making it **less informative as a standalone diagnostic marker**. Ear anomalies can range from minor structural variations to significant developmental defects and occur in numerous syndromes, reducing its specificity for any particular disease[1].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nEar abnormalities are **not rare** and are therefore **less informative for specific disease diagnosis** when considered in isolation. However, when ear abnormalities occur in combination with other features—such as in scalp-ear-nipple syndrome (which includes underdeveloped ears alongside missing nipples and scalp abnormalities)—they become more diagnostically valuable[1]. The combination of findings is more specific than the ear abnormality alone.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nEar abnormalities can be present at birth as congenital findings or develop later depending on the underlying condition[1]. There is **no specific gender predilection** for ear abnormalities in general. However, when ear abnormalities are part of specific syndromes like scalp-ear-nipple syndrome, they are congenital and present from birth[1].\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Rarity | Specificity | Diagnostic Value | Gender Bias | Age of Onset |\n|----------|--------|-------------|------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Absent nipple (Athelia) | Rare | High | High | Males more affected (Poland syndrome) | Birth |\n| Aplasia cutis congenita | Rare | Moderate-High | Moderate-High | No predilection | Birth |\n| Abnormality of the ear | Common | Low | Low | No predilection | Variable |\n\nThe absent nipple is the most informative and specific finding, particularly when associated with other features.

While athelia itself is uncommon overall, it serves as a strong diagnostic indicator when present, as it is frequently associated with particular genetic syndromes rather than occurring in isolation[1][3].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nAthelia is highly specific to certain genetic conditions, making it a valuable diagnostic marker. The condition is most commonly associated with Poland syndrome and ectodermal dysplasia[3]. Other specific genetic conditions that cause athelia include hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, Yunis-Varon syndrome, progeria syndrome, scalp-ear-nipple syndrome, and Al-Awadi-Rass-Rothschild syndrome[1][3]. The presence of athelia should prompt investigation into these underlying syndromes, as the nipple absence is typically a manifestation of a broader genetic disorder rather than an isolated anomaly[1].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nPoland syndrome, which commonly presents with athelia, is more prevalent in males than females[3]. However, ectodermal dysplasia, another major cause of athelia, affects males and females equally[3]. Athelia is a congenital condition present at birth, so it is identified in infants and children[1]. The condition does not develop later in life; it is present from birth.\n\n## Abnormality of the Ear (HP:0000598)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nAbnormality of the ear is a **common and relatively non-specific term** that is **less informative for identifying a particular disease**. Ear anomalies can occur in numerous genetic syndromes and conditions, making this term broad and less discriminatory as a diagnostic feature. While ear abnormalities can be part of syndromic presentations, the term itself does not point to a specific diagnosis.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nEar abnormalities are not rare and are associated with many different conditions. However, when ear abnormalities occur in combination with other features—particularly with absent nipples and scalp defects—they become more informative. Specifically, scalp-ear-nipple syndrome is characterized by the triad of scalp aplasia cutis congenita, ear abnormalities (small, cup-shaped, folded, or misshapen ears), and absent or underdeveloped nipples[7]. In this context, ear abnormalities serve as part of a specific diagnostic pattern rather than being informative on their own.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nEar abnormalities occur in both males and females and are present from birth as congenital features[7]. There is no specific gender predilection for ear anomalies in general, though specific syndromes causing ear abnormalities may have gender-specific prevalence patterns.\n\n## Aplasia Cutis Congenita (HP:0001057)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nAplasia cutis congenita (ACC) is a **rare condition** that is **moderately informative** for disease identification[2][4]. While ACC can occur as an isolated defect, it can also be a secondary characteristic of other genetic disorders, making it important to evaluate whether ACC is occurring independently or as part of a broader syndrome[4]. The condition itself is distinctive enough to be recognized at birth, but its presence does not automatically indicate a specific disease without further investigation[4].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nACC is rare and can occur in isolation or as part of syndromic presentations[4]. When ACC appears as part of a syndrome—such as scalp-ear-nipple syndrome—it becomes more specific for that particular condition[7]. ACC most commonly affects the scalp but can involve other areas including the trunk, arms, and legs[2][4][6]. The specificity of ACC increases when it is combined with other clinical features, such as ear abnormalities and absent nipples in scalp-ear-nipple syndrome[7].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nACC is a congenital condition present at birth, so it is identified in newborns and infants[2][4]. There is no documented gender predilection for isolated ACC. However, when ACC occurs as part of scalp-ear-nipple syndrome, which can be inherited, family history may influence risk. The condition is diagnosed immediately at birth through the characteristic absence of skin[4].\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Disease Specificity | Gender Predilection | Age of Onset |\n|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Absent Nipple | Rare | High (specific syndromes) | Males (Poland syndrome) | Birth (congenital) |\n| Abnormality of the Ear | Common | Low (non-specific) | No predilection | Birth (congenital) |\n| Aplasia Cutis Congenita | Rare | Moderate (can be isolated or syndromic) | No predilection | Birth (congenital) |","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Ear anomalies can occur in numerous genetic syndromes and conditions, making this term broad and less discriminatory as a diagnostic feature. While ear abnormalities can be part of syndromic presentations, the term itself does not point to a specific diagnosis.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nEar abnormalities are not rare and are associated with many different conditions. However, when ear abnormalities occur in combination with other features—particularly with absent nipples and scalp defects—they become more informative. Specifically, scalp-ear-nipple syndrome is characterized by the triad of scalp aplasia cutis congenita, ear abnormalities (small, cup-shaped, folded, or misshapen ears), and absent or underdeveloped nipples[7]. In this context, ear abnormalities serve as part of a specific diagnostic pattern rather than being informative on their own.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nEar abnormalities occur in both males and females and are present from birth as congenital features[7]. There is no specific gender predilection for ear anomalies in general, though specific syndromes causing ear abnormalities may have gender-specific prevalence patterns.\n\n## Aplasia Cutis Congenita (HP:0001057)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nAplasia cutis congenita (ACC) is a **rare condition** that is **moderately informative** for disease identification[2][4]. While ACC can occur as an isolated defect, it can also be a secondary characteristic of other genetic disorders, making it important to evaluate whether ACC is occurring independently or as part of a broader syndrome[4]. The condition itself is distinctive enough to be recognized at birth, but its presence does not automatically indicate a specific disease without further investigation[4].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nACC is rare and can occur in isolation or as part of syndromic presentations[4]. When ACC appears as part of a syndrome—such as scalp-ear-nipple syndrome—it becomes more specific for that particular condition[7]. ACC most commonly affects the scalp but can involve other areas including the trunk, arms, and legs[2][4][6]. The specificity of ACC increases when it is combined with other clinical features, such as ear abnormalities and absent nipples in scalp-ear-nipple syndrome[7].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations**\n\nACC is a congenital condition present at birth, so it is identified in newborns and infants[2][4]. There is no documented gender predilection for isolated ACC. However, when ACC occurs as part of scalp-ear-nipple syndrome, which can be inherited, family history may influence risk. The condition is diagnosed immediately at birth through the characteristic absence of skin[4].\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Disease Specificity | Gender Predilection | Age of Onset |\n|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Absent Nipple | Rare | High (specific syndromes) | Males (Poland syndrome) | Birth (congenital) |\n| Abnormality of the Ear | Common | Low (non-specific) | No predilection | Birth (congenital) |\n| Aplasia Cutis Congenita | Rare | Moderate (can be isolated or syndromic) | No predilection | Birth (congenital) |\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"0, Male\nabsent nipple, ear abnormality, aplasia cutis congenita","sample_name":"NA12386"}

Because \"abnormality of the ear\" is a broad term encompassing many types (e.g., microtia, prominent ears), it is less specific for diagnosis. Ear anomalies occur in many conditions, including branchiootorenal syndrome and other craniofacial syndromes[1][3][5][7][9]. | **Less rare, less specific**: Due to the broad nature, it is less useful alone for pinpointing a specific disease.

It is a broad clinical descriptor indicating delays in multiple developmental domains (motor, cognitive, speech, social, emotional) and is often used before a specific diagnosis is made.

It is a nonspecific sign that can be present in a variety of disorders, including central nervous system abnormalities, muscular diseases, metabolic conditions, and genetic syndromes.

Is there a specific gender or age group that is more likely to have these HPO terms?\n\n- **Age group:**\n\n  - **Global developmental delay** is specifically defined for **children younger than five years old**, as it describes delays in achieving developmental milestones in early childhood[1][3]. It is primarily used in this age group before a more definitive diagnosis (e.g., intellectual disability) is made.\n\n  - **Hypotonia** can be observed at any age but is most commonly noted in **infants and young children**, often identified during early developmental assessments[2].\n\n- **Gender:**\n\n  - There is a **slight male predominance** reported in developmental delays, including global developmental delay, possibly due to genetic factors such as X-linked conditions[4]. Studies have shown a higher risk of low developmental performance among boys in high-risk environments[4].\n\n  - For hypotonia, no strong gender predilection is consistently reported in the literature, but certain genetic disorders causing hypotonia may have gender biases depending on inheritance patterns (e.g., Fragile X syndrome affects males more severely)[3].\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                | Commonality & Informativeness                      | Rarity & Specificity                         | Age Group                 | Gender Predilection           |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Global developmental delay (HP:0001263) | Common (1-3% prevalence in children <5), less informative alone | More informative with additional features\/genetics | Children <5 years old (defined for this age) | Slight male predominance reported |\n| Hypotonia (HP:0001252) | Common sign in many disorders, less informative alone | More informative when classified as central vs peripheral hypotonia | Mostly infants and young children | No consistent gender bias; some genetic disorders may show bias |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on clinical definitions, epidemiology, and typical usage of these terms in pediatric neurology and developmental medicine[1][2][3][4][5].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Studies have shown a higher risk of low developmental performance among boys in high-risk environments[4].\n\n  - For hypotonia, no strong gender predilection is consistently reported in the literature, but certain genetic disorders causing hypotonia may have gender biases depending on inheritance patterns (e.g., Fragile X syndrome affects males more severely)[3].\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                | Commonality & Informativeness                      | Rarity & Specificity                         | Age Group                 | Gender Predilection           |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Global developmental delay (HP:0001263) | Common (1-3% prevalence in children <5), less informative alone | More informative with additional features\/genetics | Children <5 years old (defined for this age) | Slight male predominance reported |\n| Hypotonia (HP:0001252) | Common sign in many disorders, less informative alone | More informative when classified as central vs peripheral hypotonia | Mostly infants and young children | No consistent gender bias; some genetic disorders may show bias |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on clinical definitions, epidemiology, and typical usage of these terms in pediatric neurology and developmental medicine[1][2][3][4][5].\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"3, male\nglobal developmental delay, hypotonia, motor delay, cognitive delay, speech delay","sample_name":"HG02679"}

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms in Relation to Dupuytren's Contracture\n\nBased on the search results provided, I can only meaningfully address one of the six HPO terms you've listed, as the others are not relevant to the condition described in the search results.\n\n## Joint Contracture of the Hand (HP:0009473)\n\n**1. Commonality and Informativeness for Specific Disease:**\n\nThis term is **highly specific and informative** for Dupuytren's contracture. Joint contracture of the hand is the defining characteristic of this condition[1][2][3]. The contracture represents the primary pathological feature—a progressive tightening of the palmar fascia that pulls fingers into a bent position toward the palm[1][4]. This symptom is so central to the disease that it appears in the condition's name itself.\n\n**2. Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nWhile joint contractures can occur in various conditions, the specific pattern seen in Dupuytren's contracture—involving the palmar fascia with characteristic nodules and cords—is relatively distinctive[4]. However, contractures themselves are not rare in medical practice; they occur in many conditions. What makes this term informative for Dupuytren's is the specific anatomical location (palmar fascia) and the associated clinical features (nodules, pitting of skin, rope-like cords)[2][8].\n\n**3. Gender and Age Group Prevalence:**\n\nDupuytren's contracture shows clear demographic patterns. The condition is **more common in men than women**[1][2]. Age is also a significant factor, with the condition being **more common in people over age 40-50**[1][2][8].

Commonality and Informativeness for Specific Disease:**\n\nThis term is **highly specific and informative** for Dupuytren's contracture. Joint contracture of the hand is the defining characteristic of this condition[1][2][3]. The contracture represents the primary pathological feature—a progressive tightening of the palmar fascia that pulls fingers into a bent position toward the palm[1][4]. This symptom is so central to the disease that it appears in the condition's name itself.\n\n**2. Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nWhile joint contractures can occur in various conditions, the specific pattern seen in Dupuytren's contracture—involving the palmar fascia with characteristic nodules and cords—is relatively distinctive[4]. However, contractures themselves are not rare in medical practice; they occur in many conditions. What makes this term informative for Dupuytren's is the specific anatomical location (palmar fascia) and the associated clinical features (nodules, pitting of skin, rope-like cords)[2][8].\n\n**3. Gender and Age Group Prevalence:**\n\nDupuytren's contracture shows clear demographic patterns. The condition is **more common in men than women**[1][2]. Age is also a significant factor, with the condition being **more common in people over age 40-50**[1][2][8].

Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms\n\n## HP:0000602 - Ophthalmoplegia\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\n\nOphthalmoplegia is a **moderately specific symptom** that indicates a disruption in eye muscle function, but it is not highly common in the general population. It is informative because it points to specific underlying causes affecting the brain's ability to send signals to eye muscles[1]. However, the symptom itself can result from numerous different conditions—ranging from common causes like stroke and multiple sclerosis to rare genetic disorders—making it somewhat non-specific without additional clinical context[1][4].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nWhile ophthalmoplegia itself is not extremely rare, certain **types** of ophthalmoplegia are highly informative for specific diseases. Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) is a rare condition caused by genetic abnormalities in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA, making it highly specific for mitochondrial diseases[2][3][5]. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), by contrast, is more commonly associated with stroke or multiple sclerosis[6].\n\n**Age and Gender Patterns:**\n\nProgressive external ophthalmoplegia typically appears in **adults between ages 18 and 40**[2][3][4]. Men with type 2 diabetes who are **over age 45 and have had diabetes for at least 10 years** show elevated risk for developing ophthalmoplegia[3][4].\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000175 - Cleft Palate\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\n\nCleft palate is a **relatively common congenital condition** but is **highly informative** for identifying specific genetic syndromes and developmental disorders. It is one of the most frequently occurring birth defects, which makes it less specific on its own. However, when cleft palate appears alongside other features, it becomes highly diagnostic for particular syndromes[1].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nCleft palate is not rare as an isolated finding, but its presence in combination with other features (such as ophthalmoplegia, micrognathia, and joint contractures) would be highly specific for rare genetic syndromes. The combination of multiple features is far more informative than cleft palate alone.\n\n**Age and Gender Patterns:**\n\nCleft palate is a **congenital condition present at birth**. There is a slight male predominance in isolated cleft palate cases, though this varies by geographic region and ethnicity. The condition is identified during infancy or early childhood.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0009473 - Joint Contracture of the Hand\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\n\nHand joint contractures are **moderately specific symptoms** that indicate chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in non-bony tissue. They are not extremely common in the general population but can occur secondary to various conditions. As an isolated finding, they are somewhat non-specific, but they become highly informative when associated with other systemic features[1].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nHand contractures are not rare in certain disease contexts (such as arthrogryposis or neuromuscular disorders), but their presence in combination with other features like ophthalmoplegia, cleft palate, and micrognathia would be highly specific for rare genetic syndromes affecting multiple body systems.\n\n**Age and Gender Patterns:**\n\nHand contractures can be present at birth (congenital) or develop over time depending on the underlying cause. There is no strong gender predilection for contractures in general, though specific underlying conditions may show gender differences.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000347 - Micrognathia\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\n\nMicrognathia (underdevelopment of the mandible) is a **moderately specific craniofacial finding** that is informative for identifying developmental disorders and genetic syndromes. It is not extremely common but appears in various conditions affecting mandibular development. As an isolated feature, it has limited specificity but becomes highly diagnostic when combined with other features[1].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nMicrognathia is not rare as an isolated finding but becomes highly specific for rare syndromes when present with other features.

Your job is to prepare a mock clinical epicrisis for this sample.\n\nYou're given the following information about the target hpo terms:\n<hpo_info>\n# Analysis of HPO Terms\n\n## HP:0000602 - Ophthalmoplegia\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\n\nOphthalmoplegia is a **moderately specific symptom** that indicates a disruption in eye muscle function, but it is not highly common in the general population. It is informative because it points to specific underlying causes affecting the brain's ability to send signals to eye muscles[1]. However, the symptom itself can result from numerous different conditions—ranging from common causes like stroke and multiple sclerosis to rare genetic disorders—making it somewhat non-specific without additional clinical context[1][4].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nWhile ophthalmoplegia itself is not extremely rare, certain **types** of ophthalmoplegia are highly informative for specific diseases. Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) is a rare condition caused by genetic abnormalities in mitochondrial or nuclear DNA, making it highly specific for mitochondrial diseases[2][3][5]. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), by contrast, is more commonly associated with stroke or multiple sclerosis[6].\n\n**Age and Gender Patterns:**\n\nProgressive external ophthalmoplegia typically appears in **adults between ages 18 and 40**[2][3][4]. Men with type 2 diabetes who are **over age 45 and have had diabetes for at least 10 years** show elevated risk for developing ophthalmoplegia[3][4].\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000175 - Cleft Palate\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\n\nCleft palate is a **relatively common congenital condition** but is **highly informative** for identifying specific genetic syndromes and developmental disorders. It is one of the most frequently occurring birth defects, which makes it less specific on its own. However, when cleft palate appears alongside other features, it becomes highly diagnostic for particular syndromes[1].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nCleft palate is not rare as an isolated finding, but its presence in combination with other features (such as ophthalmoplegia, micrognathia, and joint contractures) would be highly specific for rare genetic syndromes. The combination of multiple features is far more informative than cleft palate alone.\n\n**Age and Gender Patterns:**\n\nCleft palate is a **congenital condition present at birth**. There is a slight male predominance in isolated cleft palate cases, though this varies by geographic region and ethnicity. The condition is identified during infancy or early childhood.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0009473 - Joint Contracture of the Hand\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\n\nHand joint contractures are **moderately specific symptoms** that indicate chronic loss of joint motion due to structural changes in non-bony tissue. They are not extremely common in the general population but can occur secondary to various conditions. As an isolated finding, they are somewhat non-specific, but they become highly informative when associated with other systemic features[1].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nHand contractures are not rare in certain disease contexts (such as arthrogryposis or neuromuscular disorders), but their presence in combination with other features like ophthalmoplegia, cleft palate, and micrognathia would be highly specific for rare genetic syndromes affecting multiple body systems.\n\n**Age and Gender Patterns:**\n\nHand contractures can be present at birth (congenital) or develop over time depending on the underlying cause. There is no strong gender predilection for contractures in general, though specific underlying conditions may show gender differences.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000347 - Micrognathia\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\n\nMicrognathia (underdevelopment of the mandible) is a **moderately specific craniofacial finding** that is informative for identifying developmental disorders and genetic syndromes. It is not extremely common but appears in various conditions affecting mandibular development. As an isolated feature, it has limited specificity but becomes highly diagnostic when combined with other features[1].\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nMicrognathia is not rare as an isolated finding but becomes highly specific for rare syndromes when present with other features. Severe micrognathia associated with other abnormalities (such as cleft palate, contractures, and ophthalmoplegia) would be highly informative for identifying specific genetic disorders.\n\n**Age and Gender Patterns:**\n\nMicrognathia is a **congenital condition** identified at birth or during early infancy. There is no strong gender predilection for micrognathia itself, though specific underlying genetic syndromes may show different inheritance patterns or gender-specific manifestations.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Informativeness | Rarity | Age of Onset | Gender Pattern |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------|--------------|----------------|\n| Ophthalmoplegia | Moderate | Moderate-High | Rare (specific types) | 18-40 (PEO); variable (other types) | Males >45 with diabetes at higher risk |\n| Cleft Palate | Common | Moderate | Not rare | Birth\/Infancy | Slight male predominance |\n| Joint Contracture (Hand) | Moderate | Moderate | Not rare | Birth or progressive | No strong pattern |\n| Micrognathia | Moderate | Moderate | Not rare | Birth\/Infancy | No strong pattern |\n\nWhen these four features appear together, they become highly specific for rare genetic syndromes and are far more informative than any single feature alone.\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"25, male\nophthalmoplegia, cleft palate, hand joint contracture, micrognathia","sample_name":"NA18971"}

Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms for Disease Specificity and Prevalence\n\n## Micrognathia (HP:0000347)\n\n**Specificity and Commonality:**\n\nMicrognathia is a **moderately specific but relatively common finding** in certain contexts. It occurs in approximately 1 in 1,500 to 5,000 live births[1][4], making it fairly common in the neonatal population. However, it is highly informative when present because it frequently indicates underlying genetic syndromes rather than occurring as an isolated finding.\n\n**Disease Specificity:**\n\nThis term is **highly informative for specific diseases**. Micrognathia is a characteristic feature of multiple well-defined genetic syndromes including Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome, Stickler syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome[2][4]. When micrognathia is identified, it prompts investigation for these associated conditions, making it diagnostically valuable.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nMicrognathia is **not gender-specific** but is **age-dependent**. It is most commonly identified in newborns and infants[1][5]. The condition often corrects itself naturally as children grow, with significant jaw growth typically occurring between 6 and 18 months of age and continuing through puberty[6][8]. In adults, micrognathia is less common and typically results from trauma or temporomandibular joint issues rather than congenital causes[5].\n\n---\n\n## Ptosis (HP:0000508)\n\n**Specificity and Commonality:**\n\nPtosis is a **non-specific and relatively common finding** that appears across numerous unrelated conditions. It is a general sign of neuromuscular or structural dysfunction affecting the eyelid, making it less informative for identifying a specific disease on its own.\n\n**Disease Specificity:**\n\nThis term is **less informative for specific diseases** because it can result from diverse etiologies including myasthenia gravis, oculomotor nerve palsy, Horner syndrome, and various muscular dystrophies. Ptosis requires additional clinical context and findings to be diagnostically meaningful.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nPtosis can occur across **all age groups and both genders** without clear predilection. However, certain causes of ptosis show age associations—for example, age-related ptosis becomes more common in elderly populations due to levator muscle dehiscence, while congenital ptosis presents from birth.\n\n---\n\n## Joint Contracture of the Hand (HP:0009473)\n\n**Specificity and Commonality:**\n\nJoint contractures of the hand are **moderately specific findings** that indicate chronic structural changes in soft tissues. While contractures can develop secondary to various conditions, their presence in the hands is somewhat informative because hand involvement often reflects systemic or genetic disorders.\n\n**Disease Specificity:**\n\nThis term is **informative for specific disease categories**, particularly genetic syndromes affecting connective tissue or neuromuscular function. Hand contractures are characteristic of conditions like arthrogryposis, certain forms of muscular dystrophy, and connective tissue disorders. However, contractures can also develop secondarily from disuse, trauma, or inflammation, reducing their specificity as a primary diagnostic indicator.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nHand contractures are **not gender-specific** but show **age-related patterns**. Congenital contractures present from birth or early infancy, while acquired contractures develop over time depending on the underlying cause. Progressive conditions causing contractures typically worsen with age.\n\n---\n\n## Scoliosis (HP:0002650)\n\n**Specificity and Commonality:**\n\nScoliosis is a **common but non-specific finding**. It affects approximately 2-3% of the general population, making it one of the most frequently encountered skeletal abnormalities. Most cases are idiopathic, and scoliosis appears as a secondary feature in numerous genetic syndromes.\n\n**Disease Specificity:**\n\nThis term is **less informative for identifying specific diseases** when considered in isolation. While scoliosis is associated with genetic conditions like Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and neurofibromatosis, it is not pathognomonic for any single condition. Scoliosis requires additional clinical and genetic findings to be diagnostically meaningful.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nScoliosis shows **clear gender differences**, with females being 4-8 times more likely to have progressive idiopathic scoliosis requiring treatment[2]. **Age is also significant**—adolescent idiopathic scoliosis typically manifests during the growth spurt between ages 10-16, while infantile and juvenile forms present earlier. Adult-onset scoliosis can develop from degenerative changes.\n\n---\n\n## Cleft Palate (HP:0000175)\n\n**Specificity and Commonality:**\n\nCleft palate is a **relatively common birth defect** affecting approximately 1 in 700 births in the United States[4]. While not rare, it is more specific than ptosis or scoliosis because it represents a distinct developmental defect with identifiable causes.\n\n**Disease Specificity:**\n\nThis term is **moderately informative for specific diseases**. Cleft palate frequently occurs as part of genetic syndromes including Pierre Robin sequence, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and Treacher Collins syndrome[2][4]. However, it can also occur as an isolated finding without associated genetic syndrome, reducing its specificity. When cleft palate is identified alongside other features like micrognathia, it becomes more diagnostically valuable.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nCleft palate is **identifiable prenatally** via ultrasound and is **present at birth**. It shows **slight male predominance** in most populations. There is **no age-related progression** after birth, though surgical repair typically occurs in infancy.

Your job is to prepare a mock clinical epicrisis for this sample.\n\nYou're given the following information about the target hpo terms:\n<hpo_info>\n# Analysis of HPO Terms for Disease Specificity and Prevalence\n\n## Micrognathia (HP:0000347)\n\n**Specificity and Commonality:**\n\nMicrognathia is a **moderately specific but relatively common finding** in certain contexts. It occurs in approximately 1 in 1,500 to 5,000 live births[1][4], making it fairly common in the neonatal population. However, it is highly informative when present because it frequently indicates underlying genetic syndromes rather than occurring as an isolated finding.\n\n**Disease Specificity:**\n\nThis term is **highly informative for specific diseases**. Micrognathia is a characteristic feature of multiple well-defined genetic syndromes including Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome, Stickler syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome[2][4]. When micrognathia is identified, it prompts investigation for these associated conditions, making it diagnostically valuable.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nMicrognathia is **not gender-specific** but is **age-dependent**. It is most commonly identified in newborns and infants[1][5]. The condition often corrects itself naturally as children grow, with significant jaw growth typically occurring between 6 and 18 months of age and continuing through puberty[6][8]. In adults, micrognathia is less common and typically results from trauma or temporomandibular joint issues rather than congenital causes[5].\n\n---\n\n## Ptosis (HP:0000508)\n\n**Specificity and Commonality:**\n\nPtosis is a **non-specific and relatively common finding** that appears across numerous unrelated conditions. It is a general sign of neuromuscular or structural dysfunction affecting the eyelid, making it less informative for identifying a specific disease on its own.\n\n**Disease Specificity:**\n\nThis term is **less informative for specific diseases** because it can result from diverse etiologies including myasthenia gravis, oculomotor nerve palsy, Horner syndrome, and various muscular dystrophies. Ptosis requires additional clinical context and findings to be diagnostically meaningful.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nPtosis can occur across **all age groups and both genders** without clear predilection. However, certain causes of ptosis show age associations—for example, age-related ptosis becomes more common in elderly populations due to levator muscle dehiscence, while congenital ptosis presents from birth.\n\n---\n\n## Joint Contracture of the Hand (HP:0009473)\n\n**Specificity and Commonality:**\n\nJoint contractures of the hand are **moderately specific findings** that indicate chronic structural changes in soft tissues. While contractures can develop secondary to various conditions, their presence in the hands is somewhat informative because hand involvement often reflects systemic or genetic disorders.\n\n**Disease Specificity:**\n\nThis term is **informative for specific disease categories**, particularly genetic syndromes affecting connective tissue or neuromuscular function. Hand contractures are characteristic of conditions like arthrogryposis, certain forms of muscular dystrophy, and connective tissue disorders. However, contractures can also develop secondarily from disuse, trauma, or inflammation, reducing their specificity as a primary diagnostic indicator.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nHand contractures are **not gender-specific** but show **age-related patterns**. Congenital contractures present from birth or early infancy, while acquired contractures develop over time depending on the underlying cause. Progressive conditions causing contractures typically worsen with age.\n\n---\n\n## Scoliosis (HP:0002650)\n\n**Specificity and Commonality:**\n\nScoliosis is a **common but non-specific finding**. It affects approximately 2-3% of the general population, making it one of the most frequently encountered skeletal abnormalities. Most cases are idiopathic, and scoliosis appears as a secondary feature in numerous genetic syndromes.\n\n**Disease Specificity:**\n\nThis term is **less informative for identifying specific diseases** when considered in isolation. While scoliosis is associated with genetic conditions like Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and neurofibromatosis, it is not pathognomonic for any single condition. Scoliosis requires additional clinical and genetic findings to be diagnostically meaningful.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nScoliosis shows **clear gender differences**, with females being 4-8 times more likely to have progressive idiopathic scoliosis requiring treatment[2]. **Age is also significant**—adolescent idiopathic scoliosis typically manifests during the growth spurt between ages 10-16, while infantile and juvenile forms present earlier. Adult-onset scoliosis can develop from degenerative changes.\n\n---\n\n## Cleft Palate (HP:0000175)\n\n**Specificity and Commonality:**\n\nCleft palate is a **relatively common birth defect** affecting approximately 1 in 700 births in the United States[4]. While not rare, it is more specific than ptosis or scoliosis because it represents a distinct developmental defect with identifiable causes.\n\n**Disease Specificity:**\n\nThis term is **moderately informative for specific diseases**. Cleft palate frequently occurs as part of genetic syndromes including Pierre Robin sequence, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, and Treacher Collins syndrome[2][4]. However, it can also occur as an isolated finding without associated genetic syndrome, reducing its specificity. When cleft palate is identified alongside other features like micrognathia, it becomes more diagnostically valuable.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations:**\n\nCleft palate is **identifiable prenatally** via ultrasound and is **present at birth**. It shows **slight male predominance** in most populations. There is **no age-related progression** after birth, though surgical repair typically occurs in infancy. The condition is not age-dependent in terms of onset or severity progression.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Specificity | Commonality | Diagnostic Value | Gender Bias | Age Dependency |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Micrognathia | High | Moderate (1:1,500-5,000) | High | None | High (neonatal\/infancy) |\n| Ptosis | Low | Moderate-High | Low | None | Variable by cause |\n| Joint Contracture (Hand) | Moderate | Low-Moderate | Moderate | None | Varies by etiology |\n| Scoliosis | Low | High (2-3%) | Low | Female predominance | Age-dependent onset |\n| Cleft Palate | Moderate | Moderate (1:700) | Moderate | Slight male bias | Congenital only |\n\n**Key Findings:**\n\n- **Most specific and informative**: Micrognathia stands out as the most informative term because it frequently indicates specific genetic syndromes and prompts targeted investigation.\n- **Least specific**: Ptosis and scoliosis are the least informative as isolated findings, appearing across numerous unrelated conditions.\n- **Rare and informative**: Joint contractures of the hand are relatively rare and more informative for specific genetic conditions.\n- **Gender considerations**: Only scoliosis shows significant gender predilection (female predominance).\n- **Age considerations**: Micrognathia is most age-dependent, typically presenting in neonates and improving with growth.\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"0, Male\nMicrognathia, Cleft Palate, Ptosis, Joint Contracture of the Hand, Scoliosis","sample_name":"NA19236"}

Detected at birth or prenatally. |\n| **Chiari type I malformation (HP:0007099)** | Less common in general population; often incidental and asymptomatic, thus less informative unless symptomatic. | Informative when symptomatic with neurological signs or associated with genetic syndromes.

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms in Relation to Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia\n\nBased on the search results provided, I can analyze these HPO terms in the context of progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO\/CPEO), which is the primary condition discussed in the literature.\n\n## Common and Less Informative Terms\n\n**Ophthalmoplegia** and **Ptosis** are the most common and defining features of PEO, making them less specific for differential diagnosis. Ophthalmoplegia—paralysis of the extraocular muscles—is the hallmark characteristic of the condition, present in virtually all patients[1][5]. Ptosis (drooping eyelids) is similarly ubiquitous, often described as \"an early and disabling sign\" and typically one of the first manifestations patients notice[3]. These terms are so central to the disease definition that they appear in the condition's name itself. While they are essential for diagnosis, they lack specificity because ophthalmoplegia and ptosis can result from numerous other etiologies including myasthenia gravis, thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, and various congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders[5].\n\n## Rare and Informative Terms\n\n**Cleft palate**, **Short stature**, **Scoliosis**, and **Joint contracture of the hand** are notably absent from the comprehensive search results describing PEO clinical manifestations. These terms do not appear as recognized features of progressive external ophthalmoplegia in any of the provided literature. The documented systemic features of PEO include sensorineural hearing loss, dysphagia, ataxia, sensory neuropathy, tremors, depression, parkinsonism, and cardiac involvement[3][5], but skeletal and palatal abnormalities are not mentioned. This absence suggests these terms would be highly informative if present, as they would point toward alternative diagnoses or distinct genetic syndromes rather than typical PEO.\n\n## Age and Gender Patterns\n\n**Gender**: Males and females are affected equally by PEO mutations[6]. There is no gender predilection for the condition itself, though certain inheritance patterns show sex-specific transmission. Notably, offspring of males with mtDNA mutations are not at risk, while symptomatic mothers can transmit mutations to approximately 4% of their children[7].\n\n**Age of Onset**: PEO typically emerges in adulthood, with symptom onset generally occurring between ages 18 and 40, most commonly in the third or fourth decade of life[7][8]. This adult-onset pattern is a key diagnostic feature distinguishing PEO from congenital myopathies and congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders, which present with ptosis at birth[5]. The progressive nature of the condition means that while ophthalmoplegia and ptosis are present across all affected age groups, their severity increases with age and disease duration.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms. Your job is to prepare a mock clinical epicrisis for this sample.\n\nYou're given the following information about the target hpo terms:\n<hpo_info>\n# Analysis of HPO Terms in Relation to Progressive External Ophthalmoplegia\n\nBased on the search results provided, I can analyze these HPO terms in the context of progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO\/CPEO), which is the primary condition discussed in the literature.\n\n## Common and Less Informative Terms\n\n**Ophthalmoplegia** and **Ptosis** are the most common and defining features of PEO, making them less specific for differential diagnosis. Ophthalmoplegia—paralysis of the extraocular muscles—is the hallmark characteristic of the condition, present in virtually all patients[1][5]. Ptosis (drooping eyelids) is similarly ubiquitous, often described as \"an early and disabling sign\" and typically one of the first manifestations patients notice[3]. These terms are so central to the disease definition that they appear in the condition's name itself. While they are essential for diagnosis, they lack specificity because ophthalmoplegia and ptosis can result from numerous other etiologies including myasthenia gravis, thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, and various congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders[5].\n\n## Rare and Informative Terms\n\n**Cleft palate**, **Short stature**, **Scoliosis**, and **Joint contracture of the hand** are notably absent from the comprehensive search results describing PEO clinical manifestations. These terms do not appear as recognized features of progressive external ophthalmoplegia in any of the provided literature. The documented systemic features of PEO include sensorineural hearing loss, dysphagia, ataxia, sensory neuropathy, tremors, depression, parkinsonism, and cardiac involvement[3][5], but skeletal and palatal abnormalities are not mentioned. This absence suggests these terms would be highly informative if present, as they would point toward alternative diagnoses or distinct genetic syndromes rather than typical PEO.\n\n## Age and Gender Patterns\n\n**Gender**: Males and females are affected equally by PEO mutations[6]. There is no gender predilection for the condition itself, though certain inheritance patterns show sex-specific transmission. Notably, offspring of males with mtDNA mutations are not at risk, while symptomatic mothers can transmit mutations to approximately 4% of their children[7].\n\n**Age of Onset**: PEO typically emerges in adulthood, with symptom onset generally occurring between ages 18 and 40, most commonly in the third or fourth decade of life[7][8]. This adult-onset pattern is a key diagnostic feature distinguishing PEO from congenital myopathies and congenital cranial dysinnervation disorders, which present with ptosis at birth[5]. The progressive nature of the condition means that while ophthalmoplegia and ptosis are present across all affected age groups, their severity increases with age and disease duration.\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"35, female\nophthalmoplegia, ptosis","sample_name":"NA19792"}

Restrictive ventilatory defect is a functional diagnostic criterion rather than a disease itself, making it a hallmark finding across multiple conditions.[1][2][5] It appears in numerous pulmonary and systemic disorders, reducing its specificity as a standalone diagnostic marker. However, when combined with other clinical features, it becomes highly informative for narrowing differential diagnoses.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nWhile the defect itself is not rare, the underlying causes vary widely. The term encompasses both intrinsic causes (interstitial lung diseases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis) and extrinsic causes (neuromuscular disorders, chest wall deformities, obesity).[1][3][5][6] This broad applicability makes it less specific for any single disease but essential for identifying the category of lung dysfunction.\n\n**Demographics:**\nNo specific age or gender predilection is inherent to restrictive ventilatory defect itself. However, the underlying causes may show demographic patterns—for example, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis typically affects older adults, while certain neuromuscular disorders may present in childhood or early adulthood.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0002650 - Scoliosis\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nScoliosis is **relatively common but non-specific** as a diagnostic marker. It can occur as an isolated condition or as a secondary feature in numerous genetic syndromes and systemic diseases.[2][6] When present as an extrinsic cause of restrictive lung disease, it indicates chest wall deformity limiting lung expansion, but this association alone does not point to a specific underlying diagnosis.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nScoliosis itself is not rare in the general population, but when it appears in combination with other features (such as restrictive ventilatory defect, joint contractures, and short stature), it becomes more informative for specific genetic or connective tissue disorders. In this context, it may suggest syndromic conditions affecting skeletal development and connective tissue integrity.\n\n**Demographics:**\nScoliosis can develop at any age but is most commonly diagnosed during adolescence, particularly in females who show higher rates of curve progression.

They suggest specific disease categories such as neuromuscular disorders (muscular dystrophy, ALS), connective tissue diseases (scleroderma), or inflammatory conditions affecting multiple organ systems.\n\n**Demographics:**\nHand contractures can develop at any age depending on the underlying cause. Neuromuscular diseases causing contractures may present in childhood (muscular dystrophy) or adulthood (ALS).

Paralysis of extraocular muscles indicates dysfunction of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI, or their neuromuscular junctions, making it a distinctive finding that narrows the differential diagnosis significantly.[6] This term is particularly informative when combined with systemic features.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nOphthalmoplegia is uncommon in the general population and, when present, strongly suggests specific neurological or neuromuscular disorders. It may indicate conditions such as myasthenia gravis, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, or other neuromuscular junction or motor neuron diseases. The presence of ophthalmoplegia alongside restrictive ventilatory defect and other features would be highly suggestive of a specific neuromuscular syndrome.\n\n**Demographics:**\nOphthalmoplegia can occur at any age depending on the underlying etiology. Some conditions causing ophthalmoplegia (such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy) typically manifest in middle age or later, while others may present in childhood or young adulthood.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0004322 - Short Stature\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nShort stature is **common but relatively non-specific** as a diagnostic marker. It can result from numerous causes including genetic syndromes, endocrine disorders, nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, and neuromuscular conditions.[6] While present in many genetic disorders, short stature alone does not point to a specific diagnosis without additional clinical context.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nShort stature is not rare in the general population, but when combined with other specific features (restrictive ventilatory defect, joint contractures, ophthalmoplegia, and scoliosis), it becomes more informative for identifying specific genetic or systemic syndromes affecting skeletal development and multiple organ systems.\n\n**Demographics:**\nShort stature can manifest at any age but is typically recognized during childhood and adolescence.

No strong gender predilection exists for contractures themselves, though some underlying conditions show gender differences.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000602 - Ophthalmoplegia\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nOphthalmoplegia is **rare and highly informative** for specific disease categories. Paralysis of extraocular muscles indicates dysfunction of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI, or their neuromuscular junctions, making it a distinctive finding that narrows the differential diagnosis significantly.[6] This term is particularly informative when combined with systemic features.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nOphthalmoplegia is uncommon in the general population and, when present, strongly suggests specific neurological or neuromuscular disorders. It may indicate conditions such as myasthenia gravis, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, or other neuromuscular junction or motor neuron diseases. The presence of ophthalmoplegia alongside restrictive ventilatory defect and other features would be highly suggestive of a specific neuromuscular syndrome.\n\n**Demographics:**\nOphthalmoplegia can occur at any age depending on the underlying etiology. Some conditions causing ophthalmoplegia (such as oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy) typically manifest in middle age or later, while others may present in childhood or young adulthood.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0004322 - Short Stature\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nShort stature is **common but relatively non-specific** as a diagnostic marker. It can result from numerous causes including genetic syndromes, endocrine disorders, nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, and neuromuscular conditions.[6] While present in many genetic disorders, short stature alone does not point to a specific diagnosis without additional clinical context.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nShort stature is not rare in the general population, but when combined with other specific features (restrictive ventilatory defect, joint contractures, ophthalmoplegia, and scoliosis), it becomes more informative for identifying specific genetic or systemic syndromes affecting skeletal development and multiple organ systems.\n\n**Demographics:**\nShort stature can manifest at any age but is typically recognized during childhood and adolescence. It affects both males and females, though some genetic conditions causing short stature show sex-specific inheritance patterns or variable expression between sexes.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Assessment\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Informativeness | Rarity | Disease Specificity |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|\n| Restrictive ventilatory defect | Moderate | High | Moderate | Moderate (category-specific) |\n| Scoliosis | Common | Low-Moderate | Low | Low (many causes) |\n| Joint contracture of hand | Uncommon | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate-High |\n| Ophthalmoplegia | Rare | High | High | High |\n| Short stature | Common | Low | Low | Low (many causes) |\n\n**Most informative for specific disease:** Ophthalmoplegia and joint contracture of the hand, particularly when combined with restrictive ventilatory defect, suggest specific neuromuscular or connective tissue disorders.\n\n**Least informative for specific disease:** Short stature and scoliosis, as these occur in numerous unrelated conditions and require additional clinical context for diagnostic specificity.\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"55, female\nrestrictive ventilatory defect, scoliosis, joint contracture of the hand, ophthalmoplegia, short stature","sample_name":"HG02470"}

Rarity and Informativeness:**  \n- Contractures are **more informative and relatively rare** when they occur in the context of specific genetic or neuromuscular diseases or syndromes with characteristic patterns (e.g., congenital contractures, arthrogryposis).  \n- Dupuytren's contracture is a relatively common localized fibromatosis causing hand contractures, especially in older adults of Northern European descent[1][3][9][11].\n\n**3. Gender or Age Predilection:**  \n- Dupuytren's contracture and related hand contractures are **more common in males**, typically presenting in **middle-aged to older adults** (usually >40 years)[1][3][9][11].  \n- Contractures in other diseases may have different age\/gender distributions depending on etiology.\n\n---\n\n### 3.

Commonality and Informativeness:**  \n- Ophthalmoplegia is **less common and more informative** than ptosis or hand contractures because it indicates specific involvement of eye movement muscles or their nerves.  \n- It is a hallmark of diseases like **progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO)**, internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), and other neurological or muscular disorders[2][4][6][8][10][12].\n\n**2. Rarity and Informativeness:**  \n- Ophthalmoplegia is **rare and highly informative** for diagnosing mitochondrial myopathies (e.g., PEO), multiple sclerosis (INO), brainstem lesions, and certain neuromuscular junction disorders.  \n- Its presence often points to **specific neurological or muscular pathology** rather than a nonspecific symptom.\n\n**3. Gender or Age Predilection:**  \n- PEO typically presents in **adults aged 18-40 years**, with no strong gender bias reported[2][6][14].  \n- INO is often associated with multiple sclerosis, which is more common in young adult females, or stroke in older adults[8][10].  \n- Overall, ophthalmoplegia’s age and gender distribution depend on the underlying cause.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Micrognathia (HP:0000347)  \n**Definition:** Developmental hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of the mandible (lower jaw).\n\n**1. Commonality and Informativeness:**  \n- Micrognathia is **less common and highly informative** because it is a developmental anomaly often seen in congenital syndromes (e.g., Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome).  \n- It is a **key diagnostic feature** in many genetic and craniofacial disorders.\n\n**2. Rarity and Informativeness:**  \n- Micrognathia is **rare and very informative** for specific congenital syndromes and developmental disorders.  \n- Its presence can guide genetic testing and diagnosis of syndromic conditions.\n\n**3.

Gender or Age Predilection:**  \n- Ptosis can occur at any age but is **notably seen in adults aged 18-40 years** in progressive external ophthalmoplegia[2][6].  \n- No strong gender predilection is noted for ptosis itself, but some underlying diseases may have gender biases.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Joint Contracture of the Hand (HP:0009473)  \n**Definition:** Chronic loss of joint motion in one or more hand joints due to structural changes in non-bony tissue.\n\n**1. Commonality and Informativeness:**  \n- Joint contractures of the hand are **common clinical findings** in many musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (e.g., Dupuytren's contracture), arthritis, and after trauma.  \n- As such, they are **less informative alone** for a specific disease diagnosis because many conditions cause hand contractures[1][3][9][11][15].\n\n**2. Rarity and Informativeness:**  \n- Contractures are **more informative and relatively rare** when they occur in the context of specific genetic or neuromuscular diseases or syndromes with characteristic patterns (e.g., congenital contractures, arthrogryposis).  \n- Dupuytren's contracture is a relatively common localized fibromatosis causing hand contractures, especially in older adults of Northern European descent[1][3][9][11].\n\n**3. Gender or Age Predilection:**  \n- Dupuytren's contracture and related hand contractures are **more common in males**, typically presenting in **middle-aged to older adults** (usually >40 years)[1][3][9][11].  \n- Contractures in other diseases may have different age\/gender distributions depending on etiology.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)  \n**Definition:** Paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles responsible for eye movements[https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0736-9199].\n\n**1. Commonality and Informativeness:**  \n- Ophthalmoplegia is **less common and more informative** than ptosis or hand contractures because it indicates specific involvement of eye movement muscles or their nerves.  \n- It is a hallmark of diseases like **progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO)**, internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), and other neurological or muscular disorders[2][4][6][8][10][12].\n\n**2. Rarity and Informativeness:**  \n- Ophthalmoplegia is **rare and highly informative** for diagnosing mitochondrial myopathies (e.g., PEO), multiple sclerosis (INO), brainstem lesions, and certain neuromuscular junction disorders.  \n- Its presence often points to **specific neurological or muscular pathology** rather than a nonspecific symptom.\n\n**3. Gender or Age Predilection:**  \n- PEO typically presents in **adults aged 18-40 years**, with no strong gender bias reported[2][6][14].  \n- INO is often associated with multiple sclerosis, which is more common in young adult females, or stroke in older adults[8][10].  \n- Overall, ophthalmoplegia’s age and gender distribution depend on the underlying cause.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Micrognathia (HP:0000347)  \n**Definition:** Developmental hypoplasia (underdevelopment) of the mandible (lower jaw).\n\n**1. Commonality and Informativeness:**  \n- Micrognathia is **less common and highly informative** because it is a developmental anomaly often seen in congenital syndromes (e.g., Pierre Robin sequence, Treacher Collins syndrome).  \n- It is a **key diagnostic feature** in many genetic and craniofacial disorders.\n\n**2. Rarity and Informativeness:**  \n- Micrognathia is **rare and very informative** for specific congenital syndromes and developmental disorders.  \n- Its presence can guide genetic testing and diagnosis of syndromic conditions.\n\n**3. Gender or Age Predilection:**  \n- Micrognathia is typically identified **at birth or early childhood** as a congenital anomaly.  \n- No strong gender predilection is generally reported.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                  | Common & Less Informative                   | Rare & Informative                          | Gender\/Age Predilection                          |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Ptosis (HP:0000508)**   | Common in many diseases; less specific     | Informative in PEO and specific neuromuscular disorders | Adults 18-40 in PEO; no strong gender bias       |\n| **Joint contracture of hand (HP:0009473)** | Common in many musculoskeletal diseases (e.g., Dupuytren's) | Informative in genetic\/neuromuscular syndromes | More common in males, middle-aged\/older adults   |\n| **Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)** | Less common; more specific than ptosis | Highly informative for PEO, INO, neurological diseases | Adults 18-40 in PEO; INO varies with cause       |\n| **Micrognathia (HP:0000347)** | Rare; developmental anomaly | Highly informative for congenital syndromes | Present at birth\/early childhood; no gender bias |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on clinical descriptions, epidemiology, and disease associations from the search results and established medical knowledge[1][2][3][4][6][8][9][10][12][14].\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"35, male\nptosis, ophthalmoplegia, hand contractures","sample_name":"HG00160"}

For example, in diabetic patients, ophthalmoplegia often affects cranial nerves III, IV, and VI and is more frequent in males and older adults (age ≥45 years)[2]. It is also a common ocular manifestation in MG, occurring in 10–40% of patients, often presenting as diplopia and ptosis but is not specific to a single disease[7]. Thus, ophthalmoplegia in the context of diabetes or MG is common but less specific to a particular disease.\n\n2. **Rare and informative for a specific disease:**\n   - Certain forms of ophthalmoplegia are rare and highly informative diagnostically. For example:\n     - **Ophthalmoplegic migraine (recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy)** is a rare condition with an incidence of 0.7 per million, primarily affecting children under 10 years old and males more often than females[3]. This is a distinct clinical entity with characteristic MRI findings and a relapsing-remitting course.\n     - **Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO)** is a rare mitochondrial disorder characterized by slowly progressive paralysis of extraocular muscles due to mitochondrial DNA deletions or nuclear gene mutations (e.g., POLG, TWNK)[5][6][9]. It is informative for mitochondrial diseases.\n     - **Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO)** is a specific sign often associated with multiple sclerosis and less commonly with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), helping differentiate these diseases[4][10].\n\n3. **Specific gender or age group more likely to have these terms:**\n   - **Ophthalmoplegia in diabetes:** More common in males and typically affects adults over 45 years old[2].\n   - **Ophthalmoplegic migraine:** Primarily a pediatric condition seen in children under 10 years old, with a male predominance[3].\n   - **Myasthenia gravis-related ophthalmoplegia:** Juvenile ocular MG is more frequent in Asian children, with some genetic predispositions; ocular MG can occur at any age but shows ethnic and age-related variability[1][7].\n   - **Progressive external ophthalmoplegia:** No strong gender bias reported; it is a mitochondrial disorder that can present at various ages but often in adulthood[5][6][9].\n   - **Internuclear ophthalmoplegia:** Common in adults with MS, with no strong gender bias but MS itself is more common in young adult females[4].\n\n---\n\n### HP:0009473 Joint contracture of the hand\n\n1. **More common and less informative for a specific disease:**\n   - Joint contractures of the hand are common in a variety of conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, Dupuytren's contracture, and other connective tissue disorders. Because contractures can result from many chronic joint or soft tissue diseases, they are less specific and thus less informative for diagnosing a particular disease without additional context.\n\n2. **Rare and informative for a specific disease:**\n   - When joint contractures of the hand occur as part of rare syndromes or genetic conditions (e.g., certain congenital contracture syndromes or rare neuromuscular diseases), they become more informative diagnostically. However, the search results did not provide specific rare diseases linked uniquely to hand joint contractures.\n\n3. **Specific gender or age group more likely to have these terms:**\n   - Joint contractures of the hand are generally more common in older adults due to chronic joint diseases like arthritis.\n   - Some contracture conditions (e.g., Dupuytren's contracture) have a higher prevalence in males and typically present in middle-aged to older adults.\n   - No specific pediatric or gender predilection was detailed in the search results for joint contractures of the hand.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                     | More Common & Less Informative                  | Rare & Informative                                | Gender\/Age Predilection                         |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| **Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)** | Seen in diabetes, MG, MS (common but nonspecific) | Ophthalmoplegic migraine (children), PEO (mitochondrial), INO (MS) | Diabetes: males, >45 yrs; OM: males, <10 yrs; MG: varies by ethnicity; PEO: adults; INO: adults with MS |\n| **Joint contracture of the hand (HP:0009473)** | Common in arthritis, Dupuytren's (nonspecific) | Rare congenital or genetic syndromes (not detailed) | More common in older adults; some male predominance in specific conditions |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis integrates epidemiological, clinical, and genetic insights from the search results to address the specificity, rarity, and demographic associations of these HPO terms.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  - Ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles) is **less common** and generally **highly informative** for specific diseases.\n  - It is a hallmark of several **neurological, mitochondrial, and muscular disorders**, such as chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), myasthenia gravis, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or cranial nerve palsies[4][6][8][18].\n  - Because it directly involves eye movement paralysis, it is a **specific and important clinical sign**.\n\n- **Rare and Informative Context:**\n  - Ophthalmoplegia is considered **rare** in the general population and is a **key diagnostic feature** in many rare neuromuscular and mitochondrial diseases.\n\n- **Gender and Age Predilection:**\n  - Can affect all ages depending on the underlying cause.\n  - Some causes like CPEO present in adults; congenital causes may present in children.\n  - No strong gender predilection is noted.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                  | Commonality           | Informativeness for Specific Disease | Gender Predilection      | Age Group Predilection           |\n|---------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Joint contracture of hand  | Common (e.g., Dupuytren’s) | Less informative alone             | More common in males     | Increases after age 45           |\n| Bilateral ptosis          | Less common           | More informative (systemic\/neuromuscular) | No strong predilection   | Congenital in children; acquired in adults |\n| Ophthalmoplegia           | Rare                 | Highly informative (neuromuscular\/neurological) | No strong predilection   | All ages depending on cause      |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on clinical descriptions and epidemiology from multiple sources including Merck Manuals, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and specialized ophthalmology and hand surgery literature[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][18].\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"55, male\njoint contracture of hand, bilateral ptosis, ophthalmoplegia","sample_name":"HG01271"}

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"Here is the analysis of the four HPO terms—HP:0004322 (Short stature), HP:0009473 (Joint contracture of the hand), HP:0000508 (Ptosis), and HP:0000602 (Ophthalmoplegia)—addressed systematically for your three questions:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Which HPO terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n\n- **Short stature (HP:0004322)** is a relatively common clinical finding seen across many conditions, including genetic syndromes, endocrine disorders, and nutritional deficiencies. Because it is nonspecific and occurs in a wide range of diseases, it is generally **less informative** for pinpointing a specific diagnosis.\n\n- **Joint contracture of the hand (HP:0009473)**, while less common than short stature, is a relatively frequent manifestation in disorders affecting connective tissue or causing fibrosis, such as **Dupuytren’s contracture**, which is a common adult-onset fibrotic hand condition. Given its prevalence in common conditions like Dupuytren’s, it is **more common and less specific** in that context.\n\n- **Ptosis (HP:0000508)** is a common symptom in various neurological, muscular, and congenital disorders. It can be seen in many diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis, congenital ptosis, Horner syndrome), so it is **common and less specific** by itself.\n\n- **Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)**, paralysis of eye muscles, is less common than ptosis and short stature but occurs in a range of neurological and muscular diseases (e.g., mitochondrial disorders, chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia). It is **less common than ptosis but still seen in multiple conditions**, so moderately informative.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Which HPO terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n\n- None of the four terms are inherently rare by themselves, but **joint contracture of the hand (HP:0009473)** can be quite informative when associated with specific diseases such as **Dupuytren’s contracture**, which has a distinct clinical presentation and demographic profile. The presence of hand joint contractures in a young patient or in a specific pattern can point to rarer connective tissue or genetic disorders.\n\n- **Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)** can be highly informative in the context of certain rare diseases, such as mitochondrial myopathies or specific neuromuscular disorders, where it is a hallmark feature.\n\n- **Ptosis (HP:0000508)** can be informative when it presents in a specific pattern (e.g., congenital ptosis or ptosis with fatigability in myasthenia gravis), but by itself is not rare.\n\n- **Short stature (HP:0004322)** is rarely informative alone but can be very informative when combined with other features in syndromic diagnoses.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Is there a specific gender or age group more likely to have these HPO terms?\n\n- **Short stature (HP:0004322)** affects all genders and ages but is often evaluated in children and adolescents since it relates to growth norms. It is not gender-specific.\n\n- **Joint contracture of the hand (HP:0009473)**, especially in the context of **Dupuytren’s contracture**, is **more common in males**, typically **over age 40**, and particularly in individuals of Northern European descent. It is rare in younger people and females[1][2][4][6].\n\n- **Ptosis (HP:0000508)** can occur at any age and in both genders. Congenital ptosis presents in infancy or childhood, while acquired ptosis can occur at any age.\n\n- **Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)** can affect all ages depending on the underlying cause. Some causes are congenital or early-onset (e.g., congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles), others acquired later in life (e.g., mitochondrial diseases, nerve palsies). No strong gender predilection is noted.\n\n---\n\n### Additional details on Joint Contracture of the Hand (HP:0009473) and Dupuytren’s Contracture:\n\n- Dupuytren’s contracture is a **common cause of joint contracture of the hand**, characterized by thickening and fibrosis of palmar fascia leading to finger contractures, especially of the ring and little fingers[1][2][4][5][6][7].\n\n- It is **more common in men over 40 years old**, particularly of Northern European descent, and associated with risk factors such as smoking, alcohol use, diabetes, and family history[4][6].\n\n- Treatment ranges from conservative management (splinting, injections) to surgical options (fasciotomy, fasciectomy), depending on severity and functional impairment[1][2][3][5][7][8].\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                  | Commonality & Informativeness                  | Rare & Informative Context                   | Gender\/Age Predilection                      |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| **Short stature (HP:0004322)**      | Common, nonspecific                           | Informative in syndromic\/genetic contexts    | All ages, no gender bias                      |\n| **Joint contracture of the hand (HP:0009473)** | Common in adult fibrotic conditions (e.g., Dupuytren’s), less specific | Informative in specific fibrotic\/connective tissue diseases | More common in males >40 years, Northern European descent |\n| **Ptosis (HP:0000508)**              | Common, nonspecific                           | Informative in congenital or neuromuscular disorders | All ages, no strong gender bias               |\n| **Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)**     | Less common than ptosis, moderately specific | Informative in mitochondrial and neuromuscular diseases | All ages, no strong gender bias               |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on the detailed information about joint contracture of the hand, particularly Dupuytren’s contracture, and general clinical knowledge about the other HPO terms.

Which of these HPO terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n\n- **Joint contracture of the hand (HP:0009473)**: This is a relatively common clinical finding in various conditions, notably in **Dupuytren's contracture**, a frequent fibrotic hand disorder causing finger contractures[1][3][9][13]. Because it occurs in multiple diseases and can be caused by common conditions (e.g., Dupuytren’s), it is less specific and thus less informative for pinpointing a particular disease.\n\n- **Short stature (HP:0004322)**: Short stature is a common phenotype seen across a wide range of genetic, endocrine, nutritional, and chronic diseases. It is broadly defined as height below the 3rd percentile for age and gender[HP definition]. Because it is nonspecific and prevalent in many conditions, it is less informative for diagnosing a specific disease.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

Ptosis (HP:0000508)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  - Ptosis, or drooping of the upper eyelid, is a relatively common clinical sign seen in various conditions ranging from congenital to acquired causes such as aging, trauma, or neuromuscular disorders (e.g., myasthenia gravis) [7][5][17].\n  - Because ptosis occurs in many diseases (e.g., Blepharophimosis syndrome, Noonan syndrome, muscular dystrophies), it is often considered a **common and less specific symptom** for a particular disease [1][3][11].\n  \n- **Rare and Informative Contexts:**\n  - Ptosis is more informative when it appears as part of rare syndromes such as Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES), which is a rare developmental disorder with characteristic eyelid malformations and sometimes premature ovarian insufficiency in females [1][13][15].\n  - In such syndromes, ptosis combined with other features is highly informative for diagnosis.\n\n- **Gender or Age Predilection:**\n  - Ptosis can affect **both children and adults**. Congenital ptosis is present at birth, while acquired ptosis is more common in older adults due to muscle aging or nerve damage [5][7].\n  - In BPES type I, females may have associated premature ovarian insufficiency, indicating a gender-specific manifestation in that syndrome [1].\n  \n---\n\n### 2. Flexion Contracture (HP:0001371)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  - Flexion contractures are **common clinical features** in many conditions involving joint immobility, such as prolonged inactivity, arthritis (rheumatoid or osteoarthritis), cerebral palsy, trauma, and after surgeries [2][4][6][10].\n  - Because they occur in many disorders and situations, flexion contractures alone are **less informative for a specific diagnosis**.\n\n- **Rare and Informative Contexts:**\n  - Flexion contractures are more informative when associated with rare genetic or neuromuscular diseases, such as myopathic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, where they appear alongside other distinctive features like joint hypermobility and muscle weakness [8].\n  - In lethal congenital contracture syndromes (e.g., LCCS11), flexion contractures are part of a severe, rare phenotype and thus highly informative [19].\n\n- **Gender or Age Predilection:**\n  - Flexion contractures can affect all ages but are especially common in **older adults** due to degenerative joint diseases and inactivity [6][10].\n  - They also occur in **children with congenital or neuromuscular disorders** (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy) [2][8].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  - Ophthalmoplegia, paralysis of extraocular muscles, is less common than ptosis or contractures and is often associated with specific neuromuscular or neurological disorders.\n  - It is **more informative** for diseases affecting cranial nerves or muscles, such as mitochondrial diseases, myasthenia gravis, or certain congenital syndromes [general clinical knowledge].\n\n- **Rare and Informative Contexts:**\n  - Ophthalmoplegia is a hallmark of certain rare syndromes and mitochondrial disorders, making it a **rare but highly informative sign** when present [general clinical knowledge].\n\n- **Gender or Age Predilection:**\n  - Ophthalmoplegia can occur at any age depending on the underlying cause but is often seen in **adults with acquired neuromuscular diseases** or **children with congenital syndromes** [general clinical knowledge].\n\n---\n\n### 4. Joint Contracture of the Hand (HP:0009473)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  - Joint contractures of the hand are common in various conditions including arthritis, trauma, and neuromuscular diseases [8][10].\n  - Alone, this sign is **less specific** because it occurs in many disorders.\n\n- **Rare and Informative Contexts:**\n  - When seen in combination with other systemic features in rare diseases such as myopathic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, it becomes more informative [8].\n  - It is also a key feature in rare congenital contracture syndromes and connective tissue disorders [8][19].\n\n- **Gender or Age Predilection:**\n  - Joint contractures of the hand can affect **all age groups** but are more frequent in **older adults** with degenerative diseases and in **children with congenital or genetic disorders** [8][10].\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                 | Common & Less Informative Contexts                      | Rare & Informative Contexts                         | Gender\/Age Predilection                          |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| **Ptosis (HP:0000508)**  | Common in many diseases (aging, trauma, neuromuscular) | Rare syndromes like BPES                           | Congenital (children), acquired (adults); BPES females may have ovarian insufficiency |\n| **Flexion Contracture (HP:0001371)** | Common in arthritis, inactivity, trauma             | Rare genetic\/neuromuscular diseases (e.g., EDS)  | Older adults; children with congenital\/neuromuscular disorders |\n| **Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)** | Less common, seen in neuromuscular diseases           | Rare mitochondrial and congenital syndromes       | All ages depending on cause                      |\n| **Joint Contracture of the Hand (HP:0009473)** | Common in arthritis, trauma, neuromuscular diseases | Rare connective tissue and congenital syndromes   | All ages; more in older adults and children with genetic disorders |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on the provided search results and established clinical knowledge about these HPO terms.

For example, ptosis caused by specific neurological conditions like myasthenia gravis or certain muscular dystrophies is more disease-specific.[7][13] However, the symptom of ptosis as a standalone finding is not rare and therefore not particularly informative without knowing the underlying cause.\n\n**Gender and Age Distribution**\n\nPtosis can affect both children and adults without significant gender predilection.[1][4] In children, congenital ptosis occurs when the levator muscle does not properly develop in the womb.[4] In adults, ptosis commonly develops due to aging, as the levator muscle becomes stretched and worn from years of use.[4][13] The condition shows no strong gender bias, though it can present at any age depending on the underlying etiology.\n\n## HP:0009473 - Joint Contracture of the Hand\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nHand contractures are a **moderately common finding** that can occur in various conditions, including Dupuytren's contracture, inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis), neurological conditions (cerebral palsy, stroke), and prolonged immobilization.[2][6] Because hand contractures can result from multiple different disease processes, this finding alone is not highly specific for identifying a particular disease. However, when combined with other clinical features, hand contractures can provide important diagnostic clues.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nHand contractures become more disease-specific when they occur in particular patterns or contexts. For instance, **Dupuytren's contracture** is a specific condition characterized by abnormal thickening of the palmar fascia, typically affecting the ring and little fingers.[2][5] This specific pattern of hand contracture is more informative for diagnosis. Additionally, hand contractures in the context of specific inherited conditions (such as certain forms of muscular dystrophy or cerebral palsy) carry greater diagnostic specificity.\n\n**Gender and Age Distribution**\n\nHand contractures, particularly Dupuytren's contracture, show a **strong male predominance** and typically affect **middle-aged to older adults**, though the condition can develop at any age.[2][5] Dupuytren's contracture is linked to family history, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and certain medical conditions like diabetes and epilepsy.[2] In contrast, hand contractures resulting from stroke, cerebral palsy, or rheumatoid arthritis can occur across all age groups and both genders, depending on the underlying condition.\n\n## HP:0001371 - Flexion Contracture\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nFlexion contractures are a **common clinical finding** that can develop in numerous conditions and situations, making them relatively non-specific for disease diagnosis.[6][12][15] They occur as a result of inactivity, scarring from injury or burns, prolonged immobilization, and various neurological or muscular diseases.[6][12] The most common causes include inactivity and scarring, which are not disease-specific.[6] Because flexion contractures can develop in many different clinical contexts, this finding alone provides limited diagnostic specificity without additional clinical information.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity**\n\nFlexion contractures become more disease-specific when they occur in particular anatomical locations or in association with specific conditions. For example, **hip flexion contractures** resulting from prolonged sitting are common but non-specific, whereas hip flexion contractures occurring in patients with cerebral palsy, stroke, or spastic paresis carry greater diagnostic weight.[3][9][12] Similarly, finger flexion contractures in the context of specific inherited neuromuscular diseases (muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy) or central nervous system diseases (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease) are more informative.[6]\n\n**Gender and Age Distribution**\n\nFlexion contractures show **no strong gender predilection** and can occur across all age groups.[6][12] However, certain populations are at higher risk: patients with prolonged immobilization (intensive care unit patients, post-stroke patients), elderly individuals with reduced mobility, and individuals with chronic neurological or muscular diseases.[3][6] Children with cerebral palsy commonly develop flexion contractures, while elderly patients are more prone to contractures from age-related inactivity and reduced mobility.[6][12]","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

People assigned female at birth have a higher risk of the curve getting worse than those assigned male at birth.[9] Children most commonly develop scoliosis during the growth spurt after age 10, with peak onset between ages 10 and 15.[1][13] People assigned female at birth most often stop growing at age 14, while people assigned male at birth most often stop growing at age 16.[9]\n\n---\n\n## Flexion Contracture (HP:0001371)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nFlexion contracture is a moderately common finding that can result from many different causes, making it relatively non-specific as a standalone diagnostic indicator.[10] It represents a final common pathway for numerous conditions including immobility, congenital conditions, muscle imbalances, arthritic conditions, trauma, and various systemic diseases.[10] The presence of a flexion contracture alone does not point to a specific disease.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nFlexion contractures are not rare, but when they occur in specific joints or in association with particular clinical features, they can become more informative. For example, flexion contractures associated with specific genetic conditions (such as Cerebral Palsy, Duchenne's Muscular Dystrophy, or Pterygium Syndrome) are more disease-specific.[4][10]\n\n**Demographics:**\nFlexion contractures can affect any age group, though the risk factors vary. The most frequent cause of contracture is immobilization, which can occur at any age depending on the underlying condition.[10] Certain congenital conditions causing flexion contractures (such as Cerebral Palsy) present from birth or early childhood, while contractures from arthritis or post-surgical complications are more common in older adults.[4]\n\n---\n\n## Joint Contracture of the Hand (HP:0009473)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nHand contractures are relatively common findings, particularly following hand injuries, surgery, or in association with systemic conditions like arthritis.[8] As a general finding, hand contractures are moderately informative but not highly specific, as they can result from numerous causes including trauma, fractures, joint injuries, arthritis, or post-surgical complications.[8]\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nHand contractures become more informative when associated with specific patterns or underlying conditions. For example, Dupuytren's contracture, which specifically affects the palmar fascia and causes fingers to bend toward the palm, is more disease-specific.[16] Hand contractures associated with particular genetic syndromes or systemic conditions are more diagnostically valuable than isolated hand contractures.\n\n**Demographics:**\nHand contractures can occur at any age depending on the cause. Traumatic causes (falls, sprains, jammed fingers) can occur in any age group.[8] Dupuytren's contracture, a specific type of hand contracture, shows associations with manual work and vibration exposure, suggesting occupational and potentially age-related patterns.[10] Arthritis-related hand contractures are more common in older adults.\n\n---\n\n## Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nOphthalmoplegia is a relatively rare finding that is highly informative for specific diseases. The paralysis of extraocular muscles is not a common presentation in the general population and typically indicates significant underlying pathology affecting the nervous system or the muscles themselves. This makes it a more specific and diagnostically valuable sign.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nOphthalmoplegia is rare and highly informative for disease diagnosis. Its presence suggests specific neurological or neuromuscular conditions such as myasthenia gravis, mitochondrial disorders, thyroid eye disease, nerve palsies, or other serious neurological conditions. The rarity of this finding makes it particularly valuable diagnostically.\n\n**Demographics:**\nOphthalmoplegia can occur across different age groups depending on the underlying cause. Congenital forms associated with mitochondrial disorders or genetic conditions may present in childhood, while acquired forms from stroke, trauma, or other causes can occur at any age. Some conditions causing ophthalmoplegia (such as thyroid eye disease) show gender differences, with higher prevalence in women.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Informativeness | Rarity | Disease Specificity | Age\/Gender Notes |\n|----------|-------------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Scoliosis | Common | Moderate | No | Low-Moderate | Peak age 10-15; females at higher progression risk |\n| Flexion Contracture | Moderate | Low-Moderate | No | Low | Any age; depends on underlying cause |\n| Joint Contracture of Hand | Moderate | Low-Moderate | No | Low-Moderate | Any age; occupational factors in some types |\n| Ophthalmoplegia | Rare | High | Yes | High | Variable by cause; some gender differences |\n\n**Key Finding:** Ophthalmoplegia stands out as the rarest and most informative term for specific disease diagnosis, while scoliosis and contractures are more common but less specific findings that require additional clinical context for accurate diagnosis.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Common vs. Rare and Informativeness:**\n\nThese two terms are **highly specific and informative for Dupuytren contracture**. They are not generic or non-informative—they directly describe the primary pathology of this condition. Joint contractures of the hand and flexion contractures are the defining features of Dupuytren contracture, making them very informative rather than common across many diseases.[1][2][8]\n\n**2. Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nWhile flexion contractures can occur in other conditions, their presence in the hand specifically, combined with the characteristic palmar cord formation, makes them relatively specific to Dupuytren contracture when considered in clinical context. Dupuytren contracture is described as \"one of the more common hand deformities,\"[1] so these HPO terms, while not rare in the general population, are particularly informative when appearing together in a hand disorder presentation.\n\n**3. Gender and Age Group:**\n\nDupuytren contracture **shows a clear male predominance and age-related pattern**.

They are not generic or non-informative—they directly describe the primary pathology of this condition. Joint contractures of the hand and flexion contractures are the defining features of Dupuytren contracture, making them very informative rather than common across many diseases.[1][2][8]\n\n**2. Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\n\nWhile flexion contractures can occur in other conditions, their presence in the hand specifically, combined with the characteristic palmar cord formation, makes them relatively specific to Dupuytren contracture when considered in clinical context. Dupuytren contracture is described as \"one of the more common hand deformities,\"[1] so these HPO terms, while not rare in the general population, are particularly informative when appearing together in a hand disorder presentation.\n\n**3.

Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  - Ophthalmoplegia is a relatively **rare and informative** symptom for specific diseases, especially mitochondrial disorders like **progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO)** and syndromes such as **Kearns-Sayre syndrome**[2][4][5][8].\n  - It can also occur due to more common conditions like **stroke, multiple sclerosis, diabetes (especially in men over 45 with longstanding type 2 diabetes), brain tumors, infections, and trauma**[1][3][4][7].\n  - Because it is associated with a wide range of neurological and muscular diseases, its presence is **informative** in narrowing down diagnoses involving neuromuscular or mitochondrial dysfunction.\n  - However, ophthalmoplegia itself is a **specific clinical sign** rather than a common symptom in the general population.\n\n- **Demographic Associations:**\n  - **Progressive external ophthalmoplegia** typically presents in **adults aged 18 to 40**[2][3][4].\n  - Men over 45 with type 2 diabetes for more than 10 years have a higher risk of developing ophthalmoplegia[4].\n  - It can be congenital or acquired, so age of onset varies depending on the cause.\n  - No strong gender predilection is noted outside of the diabetes association.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Flexion Contracture (HP:0001371)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  - Flexion contracture is a **common clinical finding** in many musculoskeletal and neurological conditions but is **less informative** on its own for diagnosing a specific disease because it can result from various causes such as chronic joint immobility, muscle, tendon, ligament, or skin changes.\n  - It is a **non-specific sign** of chronic joint stiffness and loss of motion.\n  - It may be seen in conditions like arthritis, stroke-related spasticity, Dupuytren’s contracture, or after injury.\n\n- **Demographic Associations:**\n  - Flexion contractures can occur at any age but are more common in **older adults** due to degenerative joint diseases or after prolonged immobilization.\n  - No specific gender predilection is reported.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Joint Contracture of the Hand (HP:0009473)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  - Contractures of the hand joints are a **subset of flexion contractures** and are relatively common in disorders affecting the hand such as **Dupuytren’s contracture, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-traumatic scarring**.\n  - Like general flexion contracture, it is **less informative alone** but can help localize pathology to the hand.\n  - It indicates chronic loss of motion due to structural changes in soft tissues.\n\n- **Demographic Associations:**\n  - More common in **middle-aged and older adults**.\n  - Some conditions causing hand contractures, like Dupuytren’s, have a higher prevalence in **men of Northern European descent**.\n  - No specific age or gender association beyond these general trends.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Ptosis (HP:0000508)\n\n- **Commonality and Informativeness:**\n  - Ptosis is a **common and relatively non-specific symptom** that can occur in many conditions, including **neuromuscular diseases (e.g., myasthenia gravis), progressive external ophthalmoplegia, Horner’s syndrome, aging (senile ptosis), and nerve palsies**[2][4][5].\n  - While common, ptosis is **informative when combined with ophthalmoplegia or other neurological signs**, especially in mitochondrial or neuromuscular diseases.\n  - Isolated ptosis is less specific but still an important clinical sign.\n\n- **Demographic Associations:**\n  - Ptosis can occur at any age.\n  - Progressive external ophthalmoplegia-related ptosis typically appears in **adults aged 18 to 40**[2][5].\n  - Senile ptosis is more common in the elderly.\n  - No strong gender predilection noted.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                   | Commonality            | Informativeness for Specific Disease          | Demographic Associations                          |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| **Ophthalmoplegia**         | Rare                  | Highly informative for mitochondrial, neurological diseases | Adults 18-40 (PEO), men >45 with diabetes risk   |\n| **Flexion Contracture**     | Common                | Less informative, nonspecific sign            | More common in older adults, no strong gender bias |\n| **Joint Contracture of Hand** | Common (subset of flexion contracture) | Less informative alone, localizes to hand pathology | Middle-aged\/older adults; some male predominance in specific causes |\n| **Ptosis**                  | Common                | Moderately informative, especially with ophthalmoplegia | Any age; PEO-related in 18-40 adults; senile in elderly |\n\n---\n\nThis analysis integrates clinical context and epidemiology from the search results to answer your questions about these HPO terms.\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"35, male, null\nophthalmoplegia, ptosis, flexion contracture, joint contracture of hand","sample_name":"HG01069"}

It can present as a primary symptom or as part of various systemic conditions.[3][5] The condition affects both children and adults and can be congenital or acquired, making it a non-specific sign that appears across multiple disease categories.[5]\n\n**Rarity and Diagnostic Specificity**\n\nWhile ptosis itself is common, it becomes more diagnostically informative when it appears as part of a **syndrome complex**. For example, ptosis is a defining feature of Blepharophimosis, Ptosis, and Epicanthus Inversus Syndrome (BPES), where it appears alongside other characteristic eyelid abnormalities.[1] In this syndromic context, ptosis gains greater diagnostic value.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations**\n\nPtosis can affect individuals across all ages. Congenital ptosis presents at birth, while acquired ptosis typically develops in older adults due to age-related stretching and weakening of the levator muscle.[3][5] There is no documented gender predilection for ptosis itself, though BPES Type I (which includes ptosis) shows gender-specific manifestations in females due to associated premature ovarian insufficiency.[1]\n\n---\n\n## HP:0001371 - Flexion Contracture\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nFlexion contractures are **relatively common findings with moderate diagnostic specificity**. They appear in multiple conditions including cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, stroke-related paralysis, and prolonged immobilization.[4][8] While flexion contractures indicate tissue pathology, they are not specific to any single disease and represent a common endpoint of various underlying conditions.\n\n**Rarity and Diagnostic Specificity**\n\nFlexion contractures become more diagnostically informative when they appear in **specific patterns or locations**. For instance, congenital flexion contractures are characteristic features of rare genetic conditions such as Myopathic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome.[6][17] The presence of multiple joint contractures in specific anatomical distributions can help narrow the differential diagnosis.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations**\n\nFlexion contractures are **common in older adults** and are particularly prevalent in individuals with prolonged immobilization or chronic neurological conditions.[8] They can develop at any age depending on the underlying cause, but are especially common in elderly populations. There is no documented gender predilection for flexion contractures themselves.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0000602 - Ophthalmoplegia (Paralysis of Extraocular Muscles)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nOphthalmoplegia is a **relatively uncommon finding that carries significant diagnostic specificity**. It indicates dysfunction of the cranial nerves controlling eye movement (CN III, IV, or VI) or the extraocular muscles themselves, making it more informative than general ptosis.[5] The presence of ophthalmoplegia narrows the differential diagnosis considerably.\n\n**Rarity and Diagnostic Specificity**\n\nOphthalmoplegia is **rare enough to be diagnostically valuable**. When present, it suggests specific neurological or neuromuscular pathology rather than simple mechanical eyelid problems. It appears in conditions such as myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy, and various cranial nerve disorders, making it a more specific indicator of systemic disease.[5]\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations**\n\nOphthalmoplegia can occur at any age depending on the underlying etiology. Congenital forms may present in childhood, while acquired forms can develop throughout life. There is no specific gender predilection documented for ophthalmoplegia itself.\n\n---\n\n## HP:0009473 - Joint Contracture of the Hand\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness**\n\nHand joint contractures are **moderately common but relatively specific findings**. They indicate localized tissue pathology affecting the hands and are particularly informative when they appear in characteristic patterns.[6] Hand contractures are less common than general flexion contractures but more specific to certain disease processes.\n\n**Rarity and Diagnostic Specificity**\n\nHand contractures are **more diagnostically specific than generalized contractures**. They are characteristic features of conditions such as Myopathic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (where congenital finger flexion contractures are noted) and Dupuytren contracture.[6][16] The specific pattern and distribution of hand contractures can help identify underlying genetic or acquired conditions.\n\n**Age and Gender Considerations**\n\nHand contractures can develop at any age but are particularly common in older adults with Dupuytren contracture, which shows a **male predominance**.[16] Congenital hand contractures present at birth and are associated with specific genetic syndromes. Acquired hand contractures typically develop in middle-aged to older individuals.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| HPO Term | Commonality | Diagnostic Specificity | Age Group | Gender Predilection |\n|----------|-------------|----------------------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Ptosis | Common | Low-Moderate | All ages; more in elderly | None |\n| Flexion Contracture | Common | Low-Moderate | All ages; more in elderly | None |\n| Ophthalmoplegia | Uncommon | High | All ages | None |\n| Hand Joint Contracture | Moderate | Moderate-High | All ages; more in middle-aged\/elderly | Male (Dupuytren) |\n\nThe **most informative terms for specific disease diagnosis** are ophthalmoplegia and hand joint contractures, as they indicate more localized pathology.

Diabetes-related ophthalmoplegia is more common in men over 45 with long-standing diabetes[7]. |\n| **HP:0000508 Ptosis**          | Ptosis is a relatively common clinical sign seen in many conditions, including aging, neurological disorders, and muscular diseases, thus less specific[6]. | Ptosis in childhood or congenital ptosis can be informative for genetic syndromes such as Noonan syndrome or mitochondrial disorders[2][6]. Ptosis as an early sign of PEO is informative for mitochondrial myopathies[3][9]. | Ptosis can occur at any age but congenital or childhood ptosis is notable in pediatric genetic disorders[6]. Ptosis in PEO typically appears in young adults[3]. |\n| **HP:0004322 Short stature**   | Short stature is common and nonspecific, seen in many conditions including familial, nutritional, and endocrine causes[2][4]. | Short stature is informative in syndromic contexts such as Noonan syndrome and Kearns-Sayre syndrome, where it is a frequent and characteristic feature[2][8]. | Short stature in Noonan syndrome is often diagnosed in childhood, with puberty onset delayed; it affects both genders but may be more studied in children[2][12]. In Kearns-Sayre syndrome, short stature appears before age 20[8]. |\n| **HP:0001371 Flexion contracture** | Flexion contractures are relatively common in various musculoskeletal and neurological conditions but are nonspecific alone[4]. | Flexion contractures of the hand can be informative in specific genetic or neuromuscular disorders where joint contractures are part of the phenotype[4][9]. | No specific gender or age group is predominantly affected; contractures can develop over time or congenitally depending on the underlying condition[4]. |\n| **HP:0009473 Joint contracture of the hand** | Joint contractures of the hand are common in many chronic musculoskeletal diseases and less specific[4]. | When present in syndromes with systemic involvement (e.g., genetic syndromes with skeletal anomalies), they are informative[4]. | No clear gender or age predilection; may appear in childhood or adulthood depending on disease[4]. |\n\n### Detailed Notes:\n\n1. **Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)**  \n   - Common causes include stroke, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, and trauma, making it less specific for diagnosis in isolation[1][7].  \n   - Rare forms like progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) are highly informative for mitochondrial diseases such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, characterized by progressive eye muscle weakness and ptosis[3][8][9].  \n   - Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is linked to brainstem lesions, commonly due to stroke or multiple sclerosis[11].  \n   - Age: PEO typically presents in adults 18-40; diabetic ophthalmoplegia is more common in men over 45 with long-standing diabetes[3][7].\n\n2. **Ptosis (HP:0000508)**  \n   - Ptosis is a common sign in many disorders and aging, thus less informative alone[6].  \n   - Congenital or childhood ptosis can indicate genetic syndromes (e.g., Noonan syndrome) or mitochondrial disorders[2][6].  \n   - Ptosis is often the earliest symptom of PEO[3][9].  \n   - Age: Can occur at any age; congenital ptosis is notable in children[6].\n\n3. **Short stature (HP:0004322)**  \n   - Common and nonspecific, but highly informative when associated with syndromes like Noonan syndrome and Kearns-Sayre syndrome[2][8].  \n   - In Noonan syndrome, short stature is frequent and often diagnosed in childhood; puberty may be delayed[2][12].  \n   - In Kearns-Sayre syndrome, short stature appears before age 20[8].  \n   - Gender: Both genders affected; some studies note slightly higher prevalence in children with certain gene variants[2].\n\n4. **Flexion contracture (HP:0001371) and Joint contracture of the hand (HP:0009473)**  \n   - These contractures are common in various musculoskeletal and neuromuscular disorders but nonspecific alone[4].  \n   - When part of syndromic presentations, they become informative[4].  \n   - No specific gender or age predominance; may develop congenitally or over time depending on the disorder[4].\n\n### Summary\n\n- **More common and less informative:** Ophthalmoplegia (general), Ptosis (general), Short stature (general), Flexion contractures, Joint contractures of the hand.  \n- **Rare and informative:** Progressive external ophthalmoplegia (ophthalmoplegia subtype), Ptosis in mitochondrial or genetic syndromes, Short stature in Noonan or Kearns-Sayre syndromes, Joint\/flexion contractures in specific genetic or neuromuscular disorders.  \n- **Age\/gender predilections:** PEO ophthalmoplegia and ptosis typically appear in young adults; diabetic ophthalmoplegia more common in older men; short stature in syndromes often diagnosed in children; no strong gender bias for contractures.\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"28, Female\nOphthalmoplegia, Ptosis, Short stature, Flexion contracture, Joint contracture of the hand","sample_name":"NA19749"}

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"Here is the synthesized information addressing your three questions for each HPO term:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)\n\n- **More common and less informative:**  \n  Ophthalmoplegia is a relatively common symptom in various neurological and muscular disorders, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, diabetes-related neuropathy, and brain tumors. Because it occurs in many conditions, it is less specific and thus less informative for pinpointing a particular disease by itself[1][7].\n\n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  Certain forms of ophthalmoplegia, such as *progressive external ophthalmoplegia* (PEO), which is a mitochondrial disorder manifesting typically in adults aged 18-40, are rare and more informative for specific mitochondrial diseases like Kearns-Sayre syndrome[3][7][9][15]. Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), caused by damage to the medial longitudinal fasciculus, is also more specific and linked to conditions like stroke or multiple sclerosis[11].\n\n- **Gender or age group prevalence:**  \n  - PEO typically appears in adults between 18 and 40 years old[3][7].  \n  - Diabetes-related ophthalmoplegia is more common in men over 45 with long-standing diabetes[5].  \n  - Ophthalmoplegia can occur at any age depending on the cause, including congenital forms[1].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Flexion contracture (HP:0001371)\n\n- **More common and less informative:**  \n  Flexion contractures are common consequences of chronic joint or muscle conditions such as arthritis, prolonged immobilization, or neurological disorders causing muscle imbalance. Because they can occur in many diseases and injuries, they are generally less specific and less informative for diagnosing a particular disease.\n\n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  Flexion contractures that occur in unusual patterns or in rare genetic or neuromuscular diseases (e.g., certain congenital myopathies or connective tissue disorders) may be more informative. However, no specific rare disease association was found in the search results for this term.\n\n- **Gender or age group prevalence:**  \n  Flexion contractures can affect any age group but are more common in older adults due to degenerative joint diseases or after prolonged immobilization. No specific gender predilection is noted.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Ptosis (HP:0000508)\n\n- **More common and less informative:**  \n  Ptosis is a common symptom that can result from aging (levator muscle stretching), trauma, or common neurological disorders such as myasthenia gravis or stroke. Because of its frequency in many conditions, it is less specific and less informative alone[2][4][8][12][16].\n\n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  Congenital ptosis or ptosis as an early sign of rare mitochondrial diseases like progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) is more informative for specific diagnoses[3][9]. Ptosis associated with rare syndromes or genetic disorders (e.g., Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome with bilateral ptosis) is also informative[10].\n\n- **Gender or age group prevalence:**  \n  Ptosis can affect all ages and genders. Congenital ptosis appears in children, while acquired ptosis is more common in older adults due to aging or neurological diseases[2][4][12].\n\n---\n\n### 4. Joint contracture of the hand (HP:0009473)\n\n- **More common and less informative:**  \n  Joint contractures of the hand are common in many conditions, including arthritis, Dupuytren’s contracture, and after trauma or immobilization. Because they occur in many diseases, they are less specific and less informative for a particular diagnosis.\n\n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  When joint contractures of the hand occur as part of rare genetic syndromes or neuromuscular diseases, they can be more informative. However, no specific rare disease association was identified in the search results.\n\n- **Gender or age group prevalence:**  \n  These contractures can affect any age but are more frequent in older adults due to degenerative conditions.

Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"Here is the relevant information about the given HPO terms addressing your three questions:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Joint contracture of the hand (HP:0009473)\n\n- **Commonality and informativeness:**  \n  Joint contracture of the hand is a relatively common clinical finding and can be seen in various conditions, including Dupuytren's contracture, which is a well-known cause of hand joint contractures due to fibrous tissue thickening and cord formation pulling fingers toward the palm[1][2][4]. Because joint contractures can result from many diseases or injuries, this term is **more common and less specific** for a particular disease.\n\n- **Rare and informative aspects:**  \n  When joint contractures occur in unusual patterns or in association with rare syndromes, they become more informative. For example, contractures limited to the hand with specific genetic or neuromuscular causes may be rare and diagnostically valuable. However, the general term itself is not rare.\n\n- **Gender or age predisposition:**  \n  Contractures of the hand, such as in Dupuytren's contracture, are **more common in middle-aged and older adults**, especially men over 40 years old, with a higher prevalence in those of Northern European descent[8]. There is no specific gender or age group for all joint contractures of the hand, but Dupuytren’s contracture is a key example with these demographics.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Flexion contracture (HP:0001371)\n\n- **Commonality and informativeness:**  \n  Flexion contracture, defined as a joint stuck in a bent position, is a **common clinical feature** in many musculoskeletal and neuromuscular disorders, including Dupuytren's contracture, arthritis, and post-injury stiffness[1][9]. As such, it is **less informative alone** for diagnosing a specific disease without additional context.\n\n- **Rare and informative aspects:**  \n  Flexion contractures that occur in specific joints or in rare syndromes (e.g., genetic connective tissue disorders) can be more informative diagnostically. The general term is common but can be part of a rare disease presentation.\n\n- **Gender or age predisposition:**  \n  Flexion contractures can affect all ages depending on cause but are more frequent in older adults due to degenerative or chronic conditions. For example, Dupuytren’s contracture-related flexion contractures are more common in men over 40[8].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000602)\n\n- **Commonality and informativeness:**  \n  Ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of eye muscles) is **less common and more informative** for specific neurological or muscular diseases such as myasthenia gravis, mitochondrial disorders, or cranial nerve palsies. It is a relatively specific symptom indicating dysfunction of extraocular muscles or their innervation.\n\n- **Rare and informative aspects:**  \n  Ophthalmoplegia is considered a **rare and highly informative sign** for diseases affecting eye movement control, including rare genetic or acquired neuromuscular disorders.\n\n- **Gender or age predisposition:**  \n  Ophthalmoplegia can occur at any age depending on the underlying cause. Some causes are more common in certain age groups (e.g., mitochondrial diseases in children, myasthenia gravis in young adults and older adults). There is no strong gender predilection overall.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Scoliosis (HP:0002650)\n\n- **Commonality and informativeness:**  \n  Scoliosis, an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine, is **relatively common**, especially adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. It is **less informative alone** because it occurs in many conditions, from idiopathic to neuromuscular and congenital causes.\n\n- **Rare and informative aspects:**  \n  When scoliosis is part of a syndrome or associated with other rare features, it becomes more informative diagnostically.\n\n- **Gender or age predisposition:**  \n  Idiopathic scoliosis is more common in **adolescent females**, while congenital or neuromuscular scoliosis can occur in any age group.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Ptosis (HP:0000508)\n\n- **Commonality and informativeness:**  \n  Ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) is a **common clinical finding** in various conditions such as myasthenia gravis, Horner syndrome, or congenital ptosis. It is **moderately informative** depending on context.\n\n- **Rare and informative aspects:**  \n  Isolated or congenital ptosis can be rare and informative for specific genetic or neuromuscular diseases.\n\n- **Gender or age predisposition:**  \n  Ptosis can occur at any age. Congenital ptosis presents in infancy, while acquired ptosis is more common in adults. No strong gender bias is noted.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Restrictive ventilatory defect (HP:0002091)\n\n- **Commonality and informativeness:**  \n  Restrictive ventilatory defect is a **common pulmonary function abnormality** seen in many diseases affecting lung parenchyma, chest wall, pleura, or neuromuscular apparatus. It is **less informative alone** because it is a functional pattern rather than a specific diagnosis.\n\n- **Rare and informative aspects:**  \n  When restrictive defects are due to rare neuromuscular or connective tissue disorders, they become more informative.\n\n- **Gender or age predisposition:**  \n  Restrictive defects can occur at any age depending on cause. Some causes (e.g., neuromuscular diseases) may have specific age or gender patterns, but generally, there is no strong demographic predilection.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                  | Common & Less Informative                     | Rare & Informative                          | Gender\/Age Predisposition                            |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Joint contracture of hand  | Common in many diseases (e.g., Dupuytren)    | Rare patterns in specific syndromes        | More common in men >40 (Dupuytren’s)                 |\n| Flexion contracture        | Common in many musculoskeletal conditions    | Rare in specific genetic disorders          | More common in older adults; men >40 (Dupuytren’s)   |\n| Ophthalmoplegia            | Less common, more specific                   | Rare, highly informative for neuromuscular | Any age; varies by cause; no strong gender bias      |\n| Scoliosis                  | Common, especially adolescent idiopathic     | Rare in syndromic forms                      | More common in adolescent females (idiopathic)       |\n| Ptosis                    | Common in various conditions                  | Rare in congenital or isolated forms        | Any age; congenital in infancy; no strong gender bias|\n| Restrictive ventilatory defect | Common in many pulmonary\/chest diseases | Rare in neuromuscular or connective tissue  | Any age; varies by underlying cause                   |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on the definitions provided and extensive clinical information about related conditions such as Dupuytren's contracture, which is a prototypical cause of hand joint contractures and flexion contractures predominantly affecting older men[1][2][4][8].

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"Here is a detailed analysis of the eight HPO terms you provided, addressing for each term: (1) commonality and informativeness, (2) rarity and informativeness, and (3) specific gender or age group predispositions.\n\n---\n\n### 1. HP:0000347 — Micrognathia  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  Micrognathia is relatively common in infants and can be seen as a non-specific feature in many genetic syndromes (e.g., Down syndrome, Pierre Robin sequence, Stickler syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome)[1][2][3]. It is often mild and may self-correct with growth, making it less informative alone for a specific diagnosis.  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  When micrognathia is severe, associated with syndromes like Pierre Robin sequence or rare chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Trisomy 18, 22q11.2 deletion), or presents with additional anomalies (e.g., cleft palate, breathing difficulties), it becomes highly informative for specific syndromes[1][6][8].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  Micrognathia is primarily a congenital condition seen in newborns and infants. It is more relevant in early childhood since it can affect feeding and breathing. There is no strong gender predilection reported[1][2][3]. It may improve with age, especially during puberty due to jaw growth[6].  \n\n---\n\n### 2. HP:0002650 — Scoliosis  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  Scoliosis, defined as an abnormal lateral curvature of the spine (Cobb angle >10°), is relatively common in the general population, especially idiopathic scoliosis in adolescents. As a standalone finding, it is less specific for a particular disease[HPO definition].  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  Scoliosis is more informative when associated with congenital vertebral malformations, neuromuscular disorders, or syndromic conditions (e.g., Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome). In these contexts, it helps narrow down diagnoses[HPO definition].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  Idiopathic scoliosis is more common in adolescent females. Congenital and neuromuscular scoliosis can present at any age depending on the underlying cause[HPO definition].  \n\n---\n\n### 3. HP:0001263 — Global developmental delay (GDD)  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  GDD is a broad and common term describing delays in multiple developmental domains in children under 5 years. It is a non-specific finding and less informative alone because it can result from a wide range of genetic, metabolic, environmental, or acquired causes[HPO definition].  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  When GDD is combined with other specific features or genetic findings, it becomes informative for particular syndromes or disorders (e.g., metabolic diseases, chromosomal abnormalities)[HPO definition].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  By definition, GDD applies to children younger than five years. There is no specific gender predisposition, though some disorders causing GDD may have gender biases[HPO definition].  \n\n---\n\n### 4. HP:0005745 — Congenital foot contractures  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  Congenital foot contractures are relatively common in various neuromuscular or connective tissue disorders but are less informative alone without additional context or associated anomalies[HPO definition].  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  When present as part of rare syndromes (e.g., arthrogryposis multiplex congenita), congenital foot contractures become highly informative for diagnosis[HPO definition].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  Present from birth (congenital). No specific gender predilection reported[HPO definition].  \n\n---\n\n### 5. HP:0009473 — Joint contracture of the hand  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  Joint contractures of the hand can occur in many conditions (e.g., immobilization, arthritis) and are less specific if isolated[HPO definition].  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  When congenital or associated with syndromes affecting connective tissue or neuromuscular function, they are informative for diagnosis (e.g., distal arthrogryposis)[HPO definition].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  Can be congenital or acquired; congenital forms present in infancy or childhood. No strong gender bias[HPO definition].  \n\n---\n\n### 6. HP:0001305 — Dandy-Walker malformation  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  Dandy-Walker malformation is a rare congenital brain malformation and thus not common. It is highly specific and informative for certain neurodevelopmental syndromes[HPO definition].  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  This malformation is rare and very informative for diagnosis of congenital brain anomalies and syndromes involving cerebellar development[HPO definition].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  Present at birth (congenital). No significant gender predilection reported[HPO definition].  \n\n---\n\n### 7. HP:0000508 — Ptosis  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  Ptosis (drooping upper eyelid) is relatively common and can be acquired or congenital. Isolated ptosis is less informative for specific syndromes[HPO definition].  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  Congenital ptosis or ptosis associated with neuromuscular or genetic syndromes (e.g., myasthenia gravis, congenital myopathies) is more informative[HPO definition].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  Can occur at any age; congenital forms present in infancy. No strong gender bias[HPO definition].  \n\n---\n\n### 8. HP:0000175 — Cleft palate  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  Cleft palate is a relatively common congenital defect and can occur isolated or as part of syndromes. Isolated cleft palate is less informative for a specific disease[HPO definition].  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  When combined with other anomalies or syndromes (e.g., Pierre Robin sequence, 22q11.2 deletion), cleft palate is highly informative[HPO definition].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  Congenital, present at birth. Slight male predominance for cleft lip with or without cleft palate; cleft palate alone is more common in females[HPO definition].  \n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                      | Common & Less Informative                         | Rare & Informative                                    | Gender\/Age Group Predilection                   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Micrognathia (HP:0000347)      | Common in infants; mild cases self-correct      | Severe cases with syndromes (Pierre Robin, Trisomy) | Congenital, infants\/children; no gender bias    |\n| Scoliosis (HP:0002650)         | Common, especially idiopathic adolescent scoliosis | Congenital\/neuromuscular\/syndromic scoliosis          | Adolescents (female>male for idiopathic)        |\n| Global developmental delay (HP:0001263) | Common, broad non-specific term                  | Informative with syndromic features                    | Children <5 years; no gender bias                |\n| Congenital foot contractures (HP:0005745) | Common in various disorders                      | Informative in arthrogryposis and rare syndromes      | Congenital; no gender bias                        |\n| Joint contracture of the hand (HP:0009473) | Common in acquired conditions                     | Informative when congenital or syndromic              | Congenital or acquired; no gender bias           |\n| Dandy-Walker malformation (HP:0001305) | Rare congenital malformation                      | Highly informative for neurodevelopmental syndromes   | Congenital; no gender bias                        |\n| Ptosis (HP:0000508)            | Common, isolated or acquired                       | Informative when congenital or syndromic               | Any age; congenital forms in infancy; no gender bias |\n| Cleft palate (HP:0000175)      | Common congenital defect                           | Informative when syndromic or combined with other defects | Congenital; slight gender differences (female>male for isolated cleft palate) |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on the HPO definitions and extensive clinical information about micrognathia and related conditions from multiple pediatric and genetic sources[1][2][3][6][8].

HP:0009473 — Joint contracture of the hand  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  Joint contractures of the hand can occur in many conditions (e.g., immobilization, arthritis) and are less specific if isolated[HPO definition].  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  When congenital or associated with syndromes affecting connective tissue or neuromuscular function, they are informative for diagnosis (e.g., distal arthrogryposis)[HPO definition].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  Can be congenital or acquired; congenital forms present in infancy or childhood. No strong gender bias[HPO definition].  \n\n---\n\n### 6. HP:0001305 — Dandy-Walker malformation  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  Dandy-Walker malformation is a rare congenital brain malformation and thus not common. It is highly specific and informative for certain neurodevelopmental syndromes[HPO definition].  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  This malformation is rare and very informative for diagnosis of congenital brain anomalies and syndromes involving cerebellar development[HPO definition].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  Present at birth (congenital). No significant gender predilection reported[HPO definition].  \n\n---\n\n### 7. HP:0000508 — Ptosis  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  Ptosis (drooping upper eyelid) is relatively common and can be acquired or congenital. Isolated ptosis is less informative for specific syndromes[HPO definition].  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  Congenital ptosis or ptosis associated with neuromuscular or genetic syndromes (e.g., myasthenia gravis, congenital myopathies) is more informative[HPO definition].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  Can occur at any age; congenital forms present in infancy. No strong gender bias[HPO definition].  \n\n---\n\n### 8. HP:0000175 — Cleft palate  \n- **Common and less informative:**  \n  Cleft palate is a relatively common congenital defect and can occur isolated or as part of syndromes. Isolated cleft palate is less informative for a specific disease[HPO definition].  \n- **Rare and informative:**  \n  When combined with other anomalies or syndromes (e.g., Pierre Robin sequence, 22q11.2 deletion), cleft palate is highly informative[HPO definition].  \n- **Gender or age group:**  \n  Congenital, present at birth. Slight male predominance for cleft lip with or without cleft palate; cleft palate alone is more common in females[HPO definition].  \n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                      | Common & Less Informative                         | Rare & Informative                                    | Gender\/Age Group Predilection                   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Micrognathia (HP:0000347)      | Common in infants; mild cases self-correct      | Severe cases with syndromes (Pierre Robin, Trisomy) | Congenital, infants\/children; no gender bias    |\n| Scoliosis (HP:0002650)         | Common, especially idiopathic adolescent scoliosis | Congenital\/neuromuscular\/syndromic scoliosis          | Adolescents (female>male for idiopathic)        |\n| Global developmental delay (HP:0001263) | Common, broad non-specific term                  | Informative with syndromic features                    | Children <5 years; no gender bias                |\n| Congenital foot contractures (HP:0005745) | Common in various disorders                      | Informative in arthrogryposis and rare syndromes      | Congenital; no gender bias                        |\n| Joint contracture of the hand (HP:0009473) | Common in acquired conditions                     | Informative when congenital or syndromic              | Congenital or acquired; no gender bias           |\n| Dandy-Walker malformation (HP:0001305) | Rare congenital malformation                      | Highly informative for neurodevelopmental syndromes   | Congenital; no gender bias                        |\n| Ptosis (HP:0000508)            | Common, isolated or acquired                       | Informative when congenital or syndromic               | Any age; congenital forms in infancy; no gender bias |\n| Cleft palate (HP:0000175)      | Common congenital defect                           | Informative when syndromic or combined with other defects | Congenital; slight gender differences (female>male for isolated cleft palate) |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on the HPO definitions and extensive clinical information about micrognathia and related conditions from multiple pediatric and genetic sources[1][2][3][6][8].

It can be familial or due to a wide range of causes including neurological disorders (e.g., cerebral palsy), neuromuscular diseases (e.g., Duchenne muscular dystrophy), hypotonia, prematurity, environmental factors, and metabolic or genetic syndromes[1][3][5][7]. Because it occurs in many conditions, it is **less informative alone** for a specific disease but important as a developmental milestone indicator.\n\n- **Rare & Informative:**  \n  When combined with other signs (e.g., dysmorphic features, intellectual disability), delayed walking can be informative for rare genetic syndromes such as Barth syndrome, Rett syndrome, Russell-Silver syndrome, or lysosomal storage disorders[1][5].\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Most children learn to walk between 12 and 15 months; walking after 18 months is considered delayed[1]. Boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy may show delayed walking retrospectively. Premature infants may show delayed walking relative to their corrected age[3][5]. No specific gender predisposition except for X-linked conditions like Duchenne muscular dystrophy affecting males predominantly.\n\n---\n\n### 2. HP:0000319 – Smooth philtrum\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  A smooth philtrum is a **rare and highly informative** feature often associated with specific syndromes, notably fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD)[PMID:19152422]. It is a distinctive facial dysmorphism that helps in clinical diagnosis.\n\n- **Rare & Informative:**  \n  It is a key diagnostic feature in syndromes involving craniofacial abnormalities and can be used to differentiate among genetic disorders.\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Present from birth; no known gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 3. HP:0000463 – Anteverted nares (Upturned nasal tip)\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Anteverted nares are a **relatively common facial feature** seen in various syndromes and normal variants[PMID:19152422][8][14]. Alone, it is **less informative** but can contribute to the facial gestalt in syndromes like Noonan syndrome or rare genetic disorders.\n\n- **Rare & Informative:**  \n  When combined with other features such as developmental delay, hypotonia, or craniofacial abnormalities, it may indicate specific syndromes (e.g., FRMD4A mutation disorder)[8].\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Present from birth; no specific gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 4. HP:0000490 – Deeply set eye\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Deeply set eyes are a **common dysmorphic feature** seen in many genetic syndromes and normal variants[PMID:19125427]. Alone, it is **less informative** but useful in combination with other features.\n\n- **Rare & Informative:**  \n  Can be part of syndromic diagnoses involving craniofacial anomalies.\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Present from birth; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 5. HP:0000508 – Ptosis (drooping upper eyelid)\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Ptosis is a **relatively common clinical sign** that can be congenital or acquired. It is **informative** when present bilaterally or with other neurological or genetic abnormalities (e.g., Noonan syndrome, congenital myasthenic syndromes)[2][14].\n\n- **Rare & Informative:**  \n  Bilateral ptosis (HP:0001488) is rarer and more suggestive of specific syndromes.\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Can be congenital or develop later; no strong gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 6. HP:0000750 – Delayed speech and language development\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  This is a **common developmental concern** with many causes including genetic syndromes, neurological disorders, and environmental factors[9][11][15]. Alone, it is **less specific** but important for early intervention.\n\n- **Rare & Informative:**  \n  When combined with other features, it can point to syndromes such as Fragile X, Rett syndrome, or Kleefstra syndrome[9][10].\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Typically noticed in early childhood; some X-linked disorders affect males more.\n\n---\n\n### 7. HP:0001371 – Flexion contracture (bent joint that cannot be straightened)\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Flexion contractures are **less common** and usually indicate chronic musculoskeletal or neuromuscular pathology[HP definition]. They are **informative** for specific diseases causing joint or muscle fibrosis, such as arthrogryposis or connective tissue disorders.\n\n- **Rare & Informative:**  \n  Specific contractures (e.g., elbow, finger) can be diagnostic clues in syndromes with joint involvement.\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Can occur at any age depending on underlying cause; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 8. HP:0000193 – Bifid uvula\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Bifid uvula is **relatively rare** and considered a mild form of cleft palate spectrum. It is **informative** as a marker for submucous cleft palate and syndromes involving midline defects[PMID:19125428].\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Present from birth; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 9. HP:0009909 – Uplifted earlobe\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Uplifted earlobe is **rare** and considered a dysmorphic feature that can be part of syndromic presentations[PMID:19152421]. It is **informative** when combined with other craniofacial anomalies.\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Present from birth; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 10. HP:0000233 – Thin vermilion border\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Thin vermilion border is a **common facial feature** with variable significance[PMID:19125428]. Alone, it is **less informative** but can contribute to syndrome recognition.\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Present from birth; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 11. HP:0000343 – Long philtrum\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  A long philtrum is **less common** and can be **informative** in syndromes with facial dysmorphism such as Cornelia de Lange syndrome or Noonan syndrome[4].\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Present from birth; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 12. HP:0008962 – Calf muscle hypoplasia\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Calf muscle hypoplasia is **rare** and **informative** for neuromuscular disorders such as muscular dystrophies or congenital myopathies[HP definition].\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Can be congenital or develop in childhood; Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects males predominantly.\n\n---\n\n### 13. HP:0009004 – Hypoplasia of the musculature\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  General muscle hypoplasia is **rare** and **informative** for congenital myopathies, genetic syndromes, or neuromuscular diseases[HP definition].\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Usually congenital or early childhood onset; no gender predilection except for X-linked disorders.\n\n---\n\n### 14. HP:0001762 – Talipes equinovarus (clubfoot)\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Clubfoot is a **relatively common congenital deformity** but can be **informative** when associated with syndromes or neuromuscular disorders[PMID:32491773].\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Present at birth; no strong gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 15. HP:0004322 – Short stature\n\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Short stature is **common** and nonspecific but **informative** when combined with other features for syndromes like Noonan syndrome, achondroplasia, or growth hormone deficiencies[HP definition][2].\n\n- **Gender\/Age Group:**  \n  Can be noted at any age; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                      | Common & Less Informative                      | Rare & Informative                              | Gender\/Age Group Notes                      |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Delayed ability to walk        | Common, many causes, nonspecific               | With syndromes (Barth, Rett, etc.)              | Mostly infants\/toddlers; some X-linked male predominance (DMD) |\n| Smooth philtrum                | Rare, highly informative                        | FASD, craniofacial syndromes                     | Present from birth; no gender bias          |\n| Anteverted nares               | Common, nonspecific                             | Syndromic when combined with other features     | Present from birth; no gender bias          |\n| Deeply set eye                | Common, nonspecific                             | Syndromic with other features                     | Present from birth; no gender bias          |\n| Ptosis                        | Common, informative if bilateral or syndromic | Congenital myasthenic syndromes, Noonan syndrome | Congenital or acquired; no gender bias      |\n| Delayed speech\/language       | Common, nonspecific                             | Fragile X, Rett, Kleefstra syndromes             | Early childhood; some X-linked male bias    |\n| Flexion contracture           | Less common, informative                        | Arthrogryposis, connective tissue disorders      | Any age; no gender bias                      |\n| Bifid uvula                  | Rare, informative                               | Midline defect syndromes                          | Present from birth; no gender bias          |\n| Uplifted earlobe             | Rare, informative                               | Syndromic craniofacial anomalies                  | Present from birth; no gender bias          |\n| Thin vermilion border        | Common, nonspecific                             | Contributes to syndromic diagnosis                | Present from birth; no gender bias          |\n| Long philtrum                | Less common, informative                        | Cornelia de Lange, Noonan syndrome                | Present from birth; no gender bias          |\n| Calf muscle hypoplasia       | Rare, informative                               | Muscular dystrophies, congenital myopathies      | Childhood onset; DMD affects males          |\n| Hypoplasia of musculature    | Rare, informative                               | Congenital myopathies, genetic syndromes         | Congenital\/early childhood; no gender bias  |\n| Talipes equinovarus          | Common congenital deformity                     | Syndromic when combined with other anomalies     | Present at birth; no gender bias             |\n| Short stature               | Common, nonspecific                             | Syndromic with other features                      | Any age; no gender bias                      |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis integrates clinical relevance, rarity, and demographic considerations based on the HPO definitions and supporting literature.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

It can also be acquired due to behaviors like thumb sucking or tongue-tie[1][3][5][7]. Because it occurs in many conditions and even in isolation, it is less specific for diagnosis. | **Rare and informative:** When associated with rare syndromes like SATB2-associated syndrome or Apert syndrome, it becomes more informative diagnostically[11][17]. If combined with other specific features, it can help narrow down diagnoses. | **Age:** More often identified in infants and children, especially when congenital or due to developmental issues[1][5][7]. No specific gender predilection reported. |\n| **HP:0001371 Flexion contracture** | **Common and less informative:** Flexion contractures are common complications in various conditions including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, cerebral palsy, post-surgical states, and immobilization[2][4][6][10][14][16]. Because they occur in many disorders and injuries, they are less specific. | **Rare and informative:** In rare genetic disorders such as Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome 11 (LCCS11), multiple joint contractures are a key diagnostic feature[18]. When contractures are congenital and part of a syndrome, they are more informative. | **Age:** Can occur at any age but congenital contractures present in infancy; acquired contractures more common in adults with chronic conditions or immobilization[2][4][6]. No clear gender bias. |\n| **HP:0000293 Full cheeks** | **Common and less informative:** Full cheeks or increased cheek prominence is a common facial feature seen in many conditions and also normal variants[9]. It is less specific for disease diagnosis. | **Rare and informative:** When markedly pronounced or associated with syndromes causing facial dysmorphisms, it can be informative[11]. | **Age:** More noticeable in infants and young children due to fat distribution; no specific gender predilection. |\n| **HP:0012712 Mild hearing impairment** | **Common and less informative:** Mild hearing impairment is a common symptom in many conditions and also in the general population, making it less specific[9]. | **Rare and informative:** When occurring as part of syndromes with characteristic hearing loss patterns, it can be more informative. | **Age:** Can occur at any age; congenital or early childhood onset is common in syndromic cases. No gender bias. |\n| **HP:0003273 Hip contracture** | **Common and less informative:** Hip contractures occur frequently in conditions causing joint immobility such as arthritis, cerebral palsy, and after injury or surgery[2][4][6][14][16]. | **Rare and informative:** Congenital hip contractures or those associated with rare neuromuscular disorders are more informative diagnostically[18]. | **Age:** Can occur at any age; congenital forms present in infancy, acquired forms in adults. No gender bias. |\n| **HP:0000369 Low-set ears** | **Common and less informative:** Low-set ears are a common minor anomaly seen in many genetic syndromes and also in normal variation, thus less specific[9][11]. | **Rare and informative:** When combined with other dysmorphic features in syndromes, it is more informative[11]. | **Age:** Present from birth; no gender predilection. |\n| **HP:0001762 Talipes equinovarus (clubfoot)** | **Common and less informative:** Clubfoot is a relatively common congenital deformity and can occur isolated or in syndromes[1][11]. Alone, it is less specific. | **Rare and informative:** Bilateral talipes equinovarus as part of syndromes like SATB2-associated syndrome or other genetic disorders is more informative[11]. | **Age:** Congenital, present at birth. No gender bias clearly established. |\n| **HP:0003196 Short nose** | **Common and less informative:** Short nose is a common facial feature in many syndromes and also normal variants, thus less specific[9][11]. | **Rare and informative:** When combined with other facial dysmorphisms in syndromes, it is more informative[11]. | **Age:** Present from birth; no gender predilection. |\n| **HP:0010751 Dimple chin** | **Common and less informative:** Dimple chin is a common facial variant and less informative alone[9]. | **Rare and informative:** When part of syndromic facial features, it may be informative[11]. | **Age:** Present from birth; no gender predilection. |\n\n### Summary of Key Points\n\n- **More common and less informative terms:** High palate, flexion contracture, full cheeks, mild hearing impairment, hip contracture, low-set ears, talipes equinovarus, short nose, and dimple chin are all relatively common features seen across many conditions and normal variants, making them less specific individually for diagnosing a particular disease.\n\n- **Rare and more informative terms:** These same features become more informative when they occur as part of rare syndromes (e.g., SATB2-associated syndrome, Apert syndrome, Lethal Congenital Contracture Syndrome 11) or in combination with other specific phenotypic abnormalities.\n\n- **Age and gender predisposition:** Most of these features are congenital or identified early in life (infants and children). There is no strong evidence of gender predilection for any of these terms. Some features (like contractures) can also be acquired later in life due to injury, disease, or immobilization.\n\nThis assessment is based on the definitions and clinical contexts provided by the HPO terms and supported by literature from clinical and genetic sources[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][9][10][11][12][14][16][18].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms: Specificity and Clinical Relevance\n\n## Overview of Term Categories\n\nThe HPO terms provided span a range of clinical features from highly non-specific to disease-indicative. Here's a comprehensive analysis of each term across the three requested dimensions.\n\n## Common and Less Informative Terms\n\n**Prominent forehead (HP:0011220)** and **High forehead (HP:0000348)** are among the most common and least specific terms in this set.[1][3] These features appear across numerous genetic syndromes and conditions, including acromegaly, Crouzon syndrome, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, Larsen syndrome, and Sotos syndrome.[1][3][4][5][6] While they serve as clinical markers, they lack diagnostic specificity on their own.\n\n**Hypertelorism (HP:0000316)** is similarly non-specific, appearing in multiple craniofacial syndromes.[4] This feature is common enough that it requires additional clinical context to be diagnostically meaningful.\n\n**Proptosis (HP:0000520)** and **Shallow orbits (HP:0000586)** frequently co-occur in craniofacial dysostosis conditions but are not pathognomonic for any single disorder.[6] These features are relatively common in syndromic craniosynostosis presentations.\n\n**Large fontanelles (HP:0000239)** is a common finding in infants with various metabolic and genetic disorders, making it non-specific without additional clinical information.\n\n## Rare and Informative Terms\n\n**Short palm (HP:0004279)** is a more specific indicator when present in combination with other features. This term is particularly informative in the context of skeletal dysplasias and certain overgrowth syndromes, as it suggests specific patterns of skeletal development abnormality.\n\n**Metaphyseal irregularity (HP:0003025)** and **Delayed epiphyseal ossification (HP:0002663)** are more specific radiological findings that point toward metabolic bone diseases or specific skeletal dysplasias. These terms are particularly informative when combined with other skeletal features, as they indicate abnormal bone development patterns.\n\n**Short phalanx of finger (HP:0009803)** is relatively specific for certain skeletal dysplasias and syndromes affecting digit development, such as Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, where it appears alongside polydactyly and syndactyly.\n\n**Hypophosphatemia (HP:0002148)** is a biochemical finding that, while not exclusively diagnostic, is highly informative when present, as it narrows the differential diagnosis to metabolic bone disorders and specific genetic conditions affecting phosphate metabolism.\n\n**Dilated cardiomyopathy (HP:0001644)** is a specific cardiac finding that, while not unique to any single syndrome, is highly informative when present alongside other features, as it indicates systemic involvement and narrows the diagnostic possibilities significantly.\n\n## Age and Gender Considerations\n\n**Age-Related Patterns:**\n\nMost of these features are **identified in infancy or early childhood**.[1][3] Frontal bossing and high forehead may be mild in early months but become more noticeable with age as skeletal development progresses.[1] Large fontanelles are specifically relevant to the neonatal and early infant period, typically closing by 9-16 months of age.[1]\n\nSkeletal features like metaphyseal irregularity and delayed epiphyseal ossification are best assessed during childhood when skeletal development is ongoing. Short phalanges and other digit abnormalities are apparent from birth or early infancy.\n\n**Gender Considerations:**\n\nThe search results do not indicate significant gender-specific differences in the prevalence of these HPO terms. Most genetic syndromes associated with these features follow **autosomal dominant inheritance patterns** (such as Crouzon syndrome and Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome), meaning they affect males and females equally.[4][6] However, some conditions like Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome are X-linked, which would show different inheritance patterns between genders.[2]\n\nNoonan syndrome, which can present with some of these features, follows autosomal dominant inheritance with a 50% transmission risk regardless of the child's gender.[7]\n\n## Clinical Integration\n\nThe most diagnostically useful approach involves recognizing that **non-specific features like prominent forehead and hypertelorism gain diagnostic value when combined with specific findings** such as short phalanges, metaphyseal irregularities, or cardiac involvement. The presence of rare, specific skeletal or biochemical findings significantly narrows the differential diagnosis and guides genetic testing and management strategies.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"Here is a detailed analysis of the given HPO terms regarding their commonality, informativeness for specific diseases, and any gender or age predilections:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Large fontanelles (HP:0000239)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Large fontanelles are relatively common in infants, especially premature babies or those with delayed skull ossification. They are less informative alone because large fontanelles can occur in many conditions such as Down syndrome, hydrocephalus, intrauterine growth retardation, and prematurity, which are relatively common or nonspecific causes[2][7]. However, when combined with other clinical features, they can be informative for specific syndromes like achondroplasia, Apert syndrome, cleidocranial dysostosis, and rickets, which are rarer[2].  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  This feature is specific to newborns and infants, as fontanelles close by 9-16 months normally[7]. Premature infants and those with certain genetic or metabolic conditions are more likely to have large fontanelles. There is no specific gender predilection reported.  \n- **Additional context:**  \n  Bulging or large fontanelles can indicate serious conditions like hydrocephalus, infections (meningitis, encephalitis), or brain hemorrhage and require urgent evaluation[1][3][4][5][8].\n\n---\n\n### 2. High forehead (HP:0000348)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  A high forehead is a relatively common and nonspecific craniofacial feature seen in various syndromes and normal variants. Alone, it is less informative because it can be subtle and present in many conditions without specificity.  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  Typically noted in children and adults; no specific age or gender predilection is documented.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Hypertelorism (HP:0000316)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Hypertelorism (widely spaced eyes) is relatively uncommon and considered an informative feature for specific syndromes such as craniofacial dysostoses, midline defects, and some genetic syndromes. It is a distinctive and measurable trait that helps narrow differential diagnoses[PMID:19125427].  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  Present from birth or early childhood; no gender bias reported.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Long palpebral fissure (HP:0000637)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  This is a relatively uncommon and informative feature, often associated with specific syndromes such as fragile X syndrome and others. It is a measurable ocular feature that can help in diagnosis[PMID:19125427].  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  Present from infancy or childhood; no specific gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Proptosis (HP:0000520)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Proptosis (prominent or bulging eyes) is uncommon and highly informative, often indicating orbital abnormalities, thyroid eye disease, or craniofacial syndromes. It is a distinctive clinical sign that can guide diagnosis[PMID:19125427].  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  Can occur at any age depending on cause; no specific gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Shallow orbits (HP:0000586)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Shallow orbits are uncommon and informative for syndromes involving craniofacial development, such as Crouzon syndrome or Apert syndrome. It is a structural abnormality that helps specify diagnosis.  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  Present from birth or early childhood; no gender bias reported.\n\n---\n\n### 7. Short nose (HP:0003196)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  A short nose is relatively common and less specific alone but can be informative when combined with other facial features in syndromes like Down syndrome or certain skeletal dysplasias[PMID:19152422].  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  Present from birth; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Respiratory insufficiency (HP:0002093)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Respiratory insufficiency is a common clinical feature in many diseases and is less informative by itself because it is nonspecific. However, it is critical for clinical management.  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  Can occur at any age; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Short palm (HP:0004279)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Short palms are uncommon and informative, often seen in skeletal dysplasias or genetic syndromes affecting limb development[PMID:19125433].  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  Present from birth or early childhood; no gender bias.\n\n---\n\n### 10. Hypophosphatemia (HP:0002148)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Hypophosphatemia is relatively uncommon and informative, indicating metabolic or renal disorders affecting phosphate metabolism. It is a laboratory finding rather than a physical trait.  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  Can occur at any age; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 11. Cleft palate (HP:0000175)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Cleft palate is relatively common among congenital anomalies and is informative for many syndromes and isolated defects[https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0736-9199].  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  Present at birth; no significant gender predilection, though some studies suggest slight male predominance.\n\n---\n\n### 12. Micrognathia (HP:0000347)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Micrognathia (small lower jaw) is relatively common and informative, seen in many syndromes such as Pierre Robin sequence and other craniofacial disorders. It is a distinctive feature aiding diagnosis.  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  Present at birth; no gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 13. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia (HP:0002100)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Recurrent aspiration pneumonia is uncommon and highly informative, indicating swallowing dysfunction or neurological impairment. It is a clinical complication rather than a primary feature.  \n- **Age\/Gender Predilection:**  \n  More common in infants and elderly with neurological or anatomical abnormalities; no gender bias.\n\n---\n\n### 14. Renal tubular acidosis (HP:0001947)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Renal tubular acidosis is uncommon and informative, indicating specific renal tubular dysfunction.

Congenital hearing loss affects as many as three of every 1,000 babies born[3], while hearing loss becomes increasingly prevalent in elderly populations. Because hearing impairment can result from numerous causes—genetic mutations, infections, trauma, medications, environmental exposure, and age-related changes—it is less informative for identifying a specific disease without additional clinical context.\n\nHowever, when hearing impairment is combined with specific inheritance patterns or genetic markers, it becomes more informative. For example, mutations in the **GJB2 gene** account for approximately 50% of non-syndromic genetic hearing loss cases[7], making GJB2-related hearing loss more specific than hearing impairment alone.\n\n### Rarity and Disease Specificity\n\nHearing impairment itself is not rare, but **specific genetic forms of hearing loss can be informative for particular diseases.** Non-syndromic genetic hearing loss accounts for approximately 70% of inherited hearing loss cases[5], with autosomal recessive inheritance responsible for about 77-80% of these cases[3][7]. When hearing loss is part of a syndrome (syndromic hearing loss), it becomes more specific to particular genetic conditions. For instance, Usher syndrome combines hearing loss with progressive vision loss, making it highly specific[10].\n\n### Gender and Age Considerations\n\n**Age:** Hearing impairment shows a strong age-related pattern. It is present from birth in congenital cases but becomes increasingly common with age. Genetic hearing loss contributes to about 60% of deafness in infants[3], while genetics likely plays an important role in age-related hearing loss in elderly populations, though exact data is limited[3].\n\n**Gender:** Inheritance patterns affect gender differently. In **X-linked inheritance**, males are more likely to be affected since they have only one X chromosome (XY), while females with two X chromosomes (XX) are typically carriers but may not experience hearing loss unless they inherit the mutated gene from both parents[1]. Autosomal dominant and recessive patterns affect males and females equally[3].\n\n---\n\n## Autism (HP:0000717)\n\n### Commonality and Informativeness\n\n**Autism is a relatively common neurodevelopmental phenotype but is also quite non-specific in terms of underlying etiology.** Autism spectrum disorder affects approximately 1 in 36 children in the U.S.[8], making it a well-recognized condition. However, autism is a behavioral diagnosis characterized by impaired social interaction, communication difficulties, and restricted repetitive behaviors. These features can result from diverse genetic and environmental causes, making autism alone less informative for identifying a specific disease without additional genetic or clinical data.\n\nThe phenotype becomes more informative when combined with specific genetic findings or when autism occurs as part of a syndrome. For example, autism associated with fragile X syndrome or Usher syndrome is more specific than autism alone[10].\n\n### Rarity and Disease Specificity\n\n**Autism is not rare**, but certain presentations of autism with specific comorbidities or genetic associations can be more informative. Notably, autism shows a significantly higher co-occurrence with hearing loss compared to the general population. Children who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing have a prevalence of autism estimated between 7% to 9%, compared to 1.7% to 2% in the general population[6][10]. This elevated co-occurrence suggests that certain genetic or environmental factors may predispose individuals to both conditions.\n\nAdditionally, research indicates that up to 80% of children with autism process auditory information differently from neurotypical peers[6], suggesting that auditory processing difficulties are a common feature of autism rather than a rare manifestation.\n\n### Gender and Age Considerations\n\n**Age:** Autism begins in childhood and is typically identifiable in early development. Signs often emerge before age three, though diagnosis may occur later. Early screening, such as newborn hearing assessments, has revealed that newborns with abnormal hearing scores are at increased risk for subsequent autism diagnosis[14].\n\n**Gender:** Autism spectrum disorder affects both males and females, though males are diagnosed more frequently. The male-to-female ratio in autism diagnosis is approximately 3-4:1, though this may reflect diagnostic bias rather than true prevalence differences. Research suggests that females may present with different behavioral profiles that make diagnosis more challenging[16].\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| Aspect | Hearing Impairment | Autism |\n|--------|-------------------|--------|\n| **Commonality** | Common (3\/1,000 births; increases with age) | Common (1 in 36 children) |\n| **Specificity** | Non-specific without additional context; more specific when linked to particular genes (e.g., GJB2) | Non-specific behaviorally; more specific when associated with genetic syndromes |\n| **Gender Bias** | X-linked forms affect males more; autosomal forms affect equally | Males diagnosed more frequently (possible diagnostic bias) |\n| **Age of Onset** | Can be congenital or acquired; increases with age | Begins in childhood; typically identifiable early |\n| **Disease Informativeness** | Rare\/specific forms exist (syndromic hearing loss); common forms are less informative | Rare when combined with specific genetic markers; common as standalone phenotype |","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

In **X-linked inheritance**, males are more likely to be affected since they have only one X chromosome (XY), while females with two X chromosomes (XX) are typically carriers but may not experience hearing loss unless they inherit the mutated gene from both parents[1]. Autosomal dominant and recessive patterns affect males and females equally[3].\n\n---\n\n## Autism (HP:0000717)\n\n### Commonality and Informativeness\n\n**Autism is a relatively common neurodevelopmental phenotype but is also quite non-specific in terms of underlying etiology.** Autism spectrum disorder affects approximately 1 in 36 children in the U.S.[8], making it a well-recognized condition. However, autism is a behavioral diagnosis characterized by impaired social interaction, communication difficulties, and restricted repetitive behaviors. These features can result from diverse genetic and environmental causes, making autism alone less informative for identifying a specific disease without additional genetic or clinical data.\n\nThe phenotype becomes more informative when combined with specific genetic findings or when autism occurs as part of a syndrome. For example, autism associated with fragile X syndrome or Usher syndrome is more specific than autism alone[10].\n\n### Rarity and Disease Specificity\n\n**Autism is not rare**, but certain presentations of autism with specific comorbidities or genetic associations can be more informative. Notably, autism shows a significantly higher co-occurrence with hearing loss compared to the general population. Children who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing have a prevalence of autism estimated between 7% to 9%, compared to 1.7% to 2% in the general population[6][10]. This elevated co-occurrence suggests that certain genetic or environmental factors may predispose individuals to both conditions.\n\nAdditionally, research indicates that up to 80% of children with autism process auditory information differently from neurotypical peers[6], suggesting that auditory processing difficulties are a common feature of autism rather than a rare manifestation.\n\n### Gender and Age Considerations\n\n**Age:** Autism begins in childhood and is typically identifiable in early development. Signs often emerge before age three, though diagnosis may occur later. Early screening, such as newborn hearing assessments, has revealed that newborns with abnormal hearing scores are at increased risk for subsequent autism diagnosis[14].\n\n**Gender:** Autism spectrum disorder affects both males and females, though males are diagnosed more frequently. The male-to-female ratio in autism diagnosis is approximately 3-4:1, though this may reflect diagnostic bias rather than true prevalence differences. Research suggests that females may present with different behavioral profiles that make diagnosis more challenging[16].\n\n---\n\n## Summary Comparison\n\n| Aspect | Hearing Impairment | Autism |\n|--------|-------------------|--------|\n| **Commonality** | Common (3\/1,000 births; increases with age) | Common (1 in 36 children) |\n| **Specificity** | Non-specific without additional context; more specific when linked to particular genes (e.g., GJB2) | Non-specific behaviorally; more specific when associated with genetic syndromes |\n| **Gender Bias** | X-linked forms affect males more; autosomal forms affect equally | Males diagnosed more frequently (possible diagnostic bias) |\n| **Age of Onset** | Can be congenital or acquired; increases with age | Begins in childhood; typically identifiable early |\n| **Disease Informativeness** | Rare\/specific forms exist (syndromic hearing loss); common forms are less informative | Rare when combined with specific genetic markers; common as standalone phenotype |\n<\/hpo_info>\n\nIf these hpo terms are common for some age \/ gender group or ethnicity, follow these for your fake profile!\n\nYour output should be in the following format:\n{\n    \"age\": [age],\n    \"gender\": [gender],\n    \"ethnicity\": [ethnicity] (only if relevant else None),\n    \"symptoms\": [symptoms] (just list some keywords, don't bother writing full sentences!)\n}\n","epicrisis":"5, male\nhearing loss, social interaction difficulties, repetitive behaviors, communication challenges","sample_name":"NA19781"}

This is not a common symptom across many diseases but rather a distinct pathological finding. However, it is relatively common as an incidental finding in the general population, which makes it less specific for identifying a particular disease state.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nWhile arachnoid cysts themselves are common findings, they are highly informative when present because they directly indicate the diagnosis. The term is specific to this particular condition and is not a nonspecific symptom that appears across multiple diseases.\n\n**Gender and Age Distribution:**\nMales are four times more likely to have arachnoid cysts than females[10]. Most individuals with arachnoid cysts develop symptoms before the age of 20, with particularly high incidence during the first year of life[10]. However, many arachnoid cysts remain asymptomatic throughout life and are discovered incidentally during imaging for unrelated reasons.\n\n## HP:0000365 - Hearing Impairment\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nHearing impairment is a relatively common symptom that appears across numerous diseases and conditions, making it less informative for identifying arachnoid cysts specifically. It is a nonspecific symptom that can result from many different etiologies.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nHearing impairment is not rare and is not particularly specific to arachnoid cysts.

However, when arachnoid cysts cause mass effects, they can result in secondary brain morphological changes.\n\n**Rarity and Disease Specificity:**\nAbnormal brain morphology is not rare and is not specific to arachnoid cysts. It appears in numerous conditions including developmental disorders, tumors, and other structural abnormalities. For arachnoid cysts, morphological changes are typically secondary effects rather than primary diagnostic features.\n\n**Gender and Age Distribution:**\nAbnormal brain morphology related to arachnoid cysts is more common in infants and young children whose skulls still have fontanels[7].

It is a broad term describing significant delays in two or more developmental domains (motor, cognitive, speech, social, emotional). Because it encompasses multiple developmental areas and can result from many causes (genetic, environmental, prenatal, perinatal), it is considered a *less specific* and *less informative* term for pinpointing a specific disease[1][4][7].\n\n- **Motor delay** is a subtype of developmental delay focused on delayed acquisition of motor skills. Motor delay is also relatively common as part of global developmental delay or isolated delays, but by itself, it is still a broad and nonspecific finding seen in many conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophies, genetic syndromes)[2][7]. Thus, motor delay is also *less informative* for specific diseases when used alone.\n\n2. **Which HPO terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?**\n\n- Neither **global developmental delay** nor **motor delay** are rare terms; both describe common clinical features seen in many pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders. However, *when combined with other more specific signs or genetic findings*, they can be informative. For example, motor delay associated with specific genetic syndromes (e.g., achondroplasia, muscular dystrophies) or global developmental delay linked to chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down syndrome, Fragile X syndrome) becomes informative[4][7].\n\n- The HPO terms themselves are *not rare or highly specific*, but their *context and associated features* determine their informativeness.\n\n3. **Is there a specific gender or age group more likely to have these HPO terms?**\n\n- Both **global developmental delay** and **motor delay** primarily apply to *children under five years old*, as GDD is defined for this age group and motor delays are typically identified in infancy and early childhood when milestones are expected[1][4].\n\n- There is a *slight male predominance* reported in developmental delays, possibly due to genetic factors such as X-linked conditions[5]. Boys may have a higher risk of low developmental performance in high-risk environments[5].\n\n- These delays are not exclusive to any gender but are more frequently diagnosed in early childhood due to milestone expectations and screening practices[1][5].\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| HPO Term               | Commonality          | Informativeness for Specific Disease | Age Group           | Gender Predominance     |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| Global developmental delay (HP:0001263) | Common (1-3% of children <5) | Less informative alone; broad phenotype | Children <5 years old | Slight male predominance |\n| Motor delay (HP:0001270)                 | Common, subtype of developmental delay | Less informative alone; seen in many conditions | Infants and young children | Slight male predominance |\n\n---\n\n**Additional context:**\n\n- Global developmental delay is a general clinical descriptor for children failing to meet multiple developmental milestones early in life and is often an early indicator of intellectual disability or neurodevelopmental disorders[1][4][7].\n\n- Motor delay specifically refers to delayed acquisition of motor milestones such as sitting, crawling, walking, and fine motor skills, and can be caused by diverse genetic and environmental factors[2][7].\n\n- Early diagnosis and intervention are critical for both conditions to improve developmental outcomes[1][3][6].\n\n- The terms are used primarily in pediatric populations and are not typically applied to adults.\n\nThis synthesis is based on clinical definitions, epidemiology, and clinical practice guidelines from multiple pediatric and developmental sources[1][2][3][4][5][7].","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms: Specificity and Clinical Significance\n\n## Overview of Term Classification\n\nThe HPO terms provided span a range of clinical features from highly common and non-specific to rare and highly informative for particular genetic syndromes. Here's a detailed analysis:\n\n## Common and Less Informative Terms\n\n**Intellectual disability** (HP:0001249) is among the most common and least specific terms in this list[1]. It appears across numerous genetic conditions and developmental disorders, making it a poor discriminator for any particular disease. Similarly, **motor delay** (HP:0001270) and **growth delay** (HP:0001510) are frequently observed in many genetic syndromes and developmental conditions, reducing their diagnostic specificity[1][3].\n\n**Feeding difficulties** (HP:11968) is also relatively common, particularly in conditions affecting neuromuscular function or craniofacial development, but appears in many different disorders[6]. **Urinary incontinence** (HP:0000020) and **distal muscle weakness** (HP:0002460) are similarly non-specific, occurring in various neurological and muscular conditions.\n\n**Macrocephaly** (HP:0000256), while clinically significant, is also relatively common and can result from multiple etiologies including benign familial macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, megalencephaly, or various genetic syndromes[1][5][9]. This makes it moderately informative but not highly specific on its own.\n\n## Rare and Highly Informative Terms\n\n**Camptodactyly** (HP:0012385) combined with other features becomes more informative, particularly when associated with specific syndromes. **Congenital hip dislocation** (HP:0001374) and **ankle flexion contracture** (HP:0006466) are relatively specific skeletal findings that, when present together with other features, can point toward particular genetic conditions[4].\n\n**Bicuspid aortic valve** (HP:0001647) is a specific cardiac malformation that, when combined with other features like macrocephaly and facial dysmorphism, can be highly informative for conditions such as Williams syndrome[8].\n\n**Long philtrum** (HP:0000343) is particularly informative when combined with other facial features. It is associated with specific genetic syndromes including fetal alcohol syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and Sotos syndrome[2][7]. The specificity increases when this feature appears alongside other characteristic findings.\n\n**Micrognathia** (HP:0000347) and **microretrognathia** (HP:0000308) are more specific craniofacial findings that, when present with other features, can suggest particular syndromes. These are particularly informative in the context of Pierre Robin sequence or other specific genetic conditions.\n\n**Low-set ears** (HP:0000369) is moderately informative, appearing in various syndromes but often as part of a constellation of facial features that together become diagnostic[1].\n\n**Facial palsy** (HP:0010628) and **absent speech** (HP:0001344) are relatively specific neurological findings that, when combined with other features, can be highly informative[6].\n\n## Gender and Age-Related Patterns\n\n**Age-specific patterns**: Most of these HPO terms manifest during infancy and early childhood. Macrocephaly is typically identified in the neonatal period or early infancy when head circumference measurements exceed the 97th percentile[1][9]. Motor delay and intellectual disability become more apparent as developmental milestones are assessed during infancy and early childhood[1][3].\n\n**Gender-specific considerations**: Most of the conditions associated with these HPO terms show no strong gender predilection, with autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive inheritance patterns being most common. However, there is one notable exception: certain X-linked conditions may show gender-specific manifestations. For example, some USP9X gene mutations cause a female-restricted syndrome with long philtrum and other craniofacial features, while males with hemizygous mutations present with a somewhat different phenotype[6].\n\n**Prenatal vs. postnatal presentation**: Features like congenital hip dislocation and bicuspid aortic valve are present from birth but may not be clinically apparent until later examination or imaging. Feeding difficulties and motor delay typically become evident in the postnatal period as developmental milestones are assessed[1][3].\n\nThe diagnostic value of these HPO terms increases substantially when they are considered as part of a syndrome-specific constellation of features rather than in isolation.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"Here is a detailed analysis of the provided HPO terms regarding their commonality, informativeness for specific diseases, and any known gender or age predilections, based primarily on the search results and supplemented by clinical knowledge:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Atrial Septal Defect (HP:0001631)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  ASD is a **relatively common congenital heart defect**, the most common congenital cardiac anomaly that is often asymptomatic until adulthood[1][2]. Because it is common and can be asymptomatic, it is **less informative alone** for diagnosing a specific disease unless combined with other findings.  \n- **Rare & Informative Aspects:**  \n  Rare subtypes like sinus venosus ASD or large defects causing significant complications are more informative for specific syndromes or severe cardiac disease[2].  \n- **Gender\/Age Predilection:**  \n  ASD occurs with a **female-to-male ratio of approximately 2:1**[1]. Symptoms often appear in adulthood, typically by the third decade, but may be diagnosed at any age[1][2].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Seizure (HP:0001250)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Seizures are a **common neurological symptom** with many causes, making them **less specific** for a particular disease without further context[5][6].  \n- **Rare & Informative Aspects:**  \n  Seizures associated with congenital heart disease (CHD), especially structural\/metabolic seizures in neonates with CHD, are more informative for underlying neurological complications of heart defects[5][6].  \n- **Gender\/Age Predilection:**  \n  Neonates and children with CHD have a higher risk of seizures and epilepsy[5][6]. The risk of epilepsy in CHD patients increases with age, up to at least 21 years[6]. No strong gender predilection noted.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Hypertonia (HP:0001276)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Hypertonia is a **common neurological sign** in various disorders, including cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental conditions, making it **less specific** alone.  \n- **Rare & Informative Aspects:**  \n  When present in combination with rare genetic syndromes or specific brain malformations, hypertonia becomes more informative.  \n- **Gender\/Age Predilection:**  \n  More commonly identified in infants and children with neurological disorders; no specific gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Your job is to prepare a mock clinical epicrisis for this sample.\n\nYou're given the following information about the target hpo terms:\n<hpo_info>\nHere is a detailed analysis of the provided HPO terms regarding their commonality, informativeness for specific diseases, and any known gender or age predilections, based primarily on the search results and supplemented by clinical knowledge:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Atrial Septal Defect (HP:0001631)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  ASD is a **relatively common congenital heart defect**, the most common congenital cardiac anomaly that is often asymptomatic until adulthood[1][2]. Because it is common and can be asymptomatic, it is **less informative alone** for diagnosing a specific disease unless combined with other findings.  \n- **Rare & Informative Aspects:**  \n  Rare subtypes like sinus venosus ASD or large defects causing significant complications are more informative for specific syndromes or severe cardiac disease[2].  \n- **Gender\/Age Predilection:**  \n  ASD occurs with a **female-to-male ratio of approximately 2:1**[1]. Symptoms often appear in adulthood, typically by the third decade, but may be diagnosed at any age[1][2].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Seizure (HP:0001250)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Seizures are a **common neurological symptom** with many causes, making them **less specific** for a particular disease without further context[5][6].  \n- **Rare & Informative Aspects:**  \n  Seizures associated with congenital heart disease (CHD), especially structural\/metabolic seizures in neonates with CHD, are more informative for underlying neurological complications of heart defects[5][6].  \n- **Gender\/Age Predilection:**  \n  Neonates and children with CHD have a higher risk of seizures and epilepsy[5][6]. The risk of epilepsy in CHD patients increases with age, up to at least 21 years[6]. No strong gender predilection noted.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Hypertonia (HP:0001276)\n- **Commonality & Informativeness:**  \n  Hypertonia is a **common neurological sign** in various disorders, including cerebral palsy and neurodevelopmental conditions, making it **less specific** alone.  \n- **Rare & Informative Aspects:**  \n  When present in combination with rare genetic syndromes or specific brain malformations, hypertonia becomes more informative.  \n- **Gender\/Age Predilection:**  \n  More commonly identified in infants and children with neurological disorders; no specific gender predilection.\n\n---\n\n### 4.

Which HPO terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n\n- **Seizure (HP:0001250)** is a relatively common symptom seen across many neurological and systemic disorders, including epilepsy, metabolic diseases, infections, and brain injuries. Because seizures occur in a wide range of conditions, they are **less informative and less specific** for diagnosing a particular disease by themselves[1][5].\n\n- **Severe global developmental delay (HP:0011344)** affects about 1-3% of children worldwide and can be caused by diverse factors such as genetic abnormalities, prematurity, infections, or brain malformations. While it is significant, it is still **relatively common in pediatric neurology and developmental clinics** and can be seen in many disorders, making it **less specific** without additional context[1][2][4][6].\n\n- **Developmental regression (HP:0002376)**, which is the loss of previously acquired developmental milestones, is **less common than developmental delay** and is more specific to certain neurodegenerative or metabolic disorders. However, it can also occur in some acquired conditions. It is **more informative than seizures or global developmental delay** because regression suggests an active pathological process causing deterioration rather than static delay[5].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Which HPO terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n\n- **Developmental regression (HP:0002376)** is relatively rare compared to developmental delay and seizures and is considered **highly informative** for specific neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Rett syndrome, neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis), metabolic disorders, or progressive encephalopathies. Its presence often narrows differential diagnosis significantly[5].\n\n- **Severe global developmental delay (HP:0011344)**, when severe and combined with other features, can be informative for specific genetic syndromes or metabolic diseases, especially when associated with characteristic clinical or genetic findings[1][6].\n\n- **Seizure (HP:0001250)** is common and nonspecific by itself but can be informative when combined with specific seizure types, EEG patterns, or associated features pointing to particular epileptic syndromes or genetic epilepsies[5].\n\n---\n\n### 3. Is there a specific gender or age group more likely to have these HPO terms?\n\n- **Severe global developmental delay (HP:0011344)** is typically diagnosed in **children under 5 years old**, as developmental milestones are expected to be met by this age. It affects both genders, though some underlying causes (e.g., X-linked disorders) may show gender bias[1][2][6].\n\n- **Seizure (HP:0001250)** can occur at any age but is **more common in childhood and infancy** due to developmental brain vulnerability. Certain seizure disorders have gender predilections depending on etiology, but seizures overall affect both genders[5].\n\n- **Developmental regression (HP:0002376)** often presents in **infancy or early childhood**, especially in genetic or metabolic neurodegenerative diseases. Some conditions with regression, like Rett syndrome, predominantly affect females due to their genetic basis (MECP2 mutation)[5].\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term                      | Commonality           | Informative for Specific Disease | Typical Age Group      | Gender Predilection               |\n|------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Severe global developmental delay (HP:0011344) | Relatively common (1-3% children) | Moderately informative, especially if severe | Usually <5 years old    | Both; some genetic causes may show bias |\n| Seizure (HP:0001250)          | Common symptom across many diseases | Less informative alone; more with specific types | Any age, more common in children | Both genders, varies by syndrome |\n| Developmental regression (HP:0002376) | Rare compared to delay and seizures | Highly informative for neurodegenerative\/metabolic diseases | Infancy\/early childhood | Some disorders (e.g., Rett) female-predominant |\n\n---\n\n### Additional Notes\n\n- Early intervention and diagnosis are critical for all these conditions to improve outcomes[2][6].\n\n- Environmental, genetic, and perinatal factors contribute to the risk of developmental delay and regression[5][10].\n\n- Seizures may require EEG and clinical correlation for specificity[5].\n\n- Developmental regression is a red flag symptom requiring urgent evaluation for progressive disorders[5].\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on the provided search results and established clinical knowledge.

These terms are broadly used and do not specify particular etiologies or syndromes.\n\n2. **Rare and informative terms for specific diseases:**\n   - More specific descriptors like \"Nonprogressive intellectual disability\" or \"Nonprogressive mental retardation\" can be more informative in distinguishing conditions where intellectual disability is stable rather than progressive, which can help narrow down diagnoses. However, the provided synonyms do not include very rare or highly specific subtypes of intellectual disability; thus, the term itself is relatively broad.\n\n3. **Gender or age group more likely to have these terms:**\n   - Intellectual disability is more frequently diagnosed in **males** than females.

Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms: Camptodactyly and Related Conditions\n\n## Overview of the HPO Terms\n\nThe provided HPO terms span a range of musculoskeletal deformities, with varying degrees of specificity and clinical utility. Let me analyze each term across the three dimensions you've requested.\n\n## Question 1: Common and Less Informative Terms\n\n**Flexion contracture (HP:0001371)** is the most common and least specific term in this set. A flexion contracture is a general condition describing any joint that cannot be straightened, affecting multiple anatomical sites and resulting from various underlying causes including muscle, tendon, ligament, or skin pathology[1]. This term appears across numerous genetic syndromes, acquired injuries, and degenerative conditions, making it broadly applicable but diagnostically non-specific.\n\n**Talipes (HP:0001883)** is another relatively common term, representing a general category of foot and ankle deformities with multiple subtypes. While it indicates a structural foot problem, it requires further specification (equinovarus, equinovalgus, etc.) to be clinically meaningful.\n\n**Downslanted palpebral fissures (HP:0000494)** is a common facial feature seen in numerous genetic syndromes and conditions. Its presence alone provides limited diagnostic specificity without additional clinical context.\n\n## Question 2: Rare and Informative Terms\n\n**Camptodactyly of finger (HP:0100490)** and **Camptodactyly (HP:0012385)** are notably more specific and informative. Camptodactyly affects approximately 1% of the population[1], making it relatively uncommon. The condition is characterized by a non-traumatic flexion contracture specifically of the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ), most commonly affecting the little finger[1]. This specificity makes it more diagnostically valuable—when present, it narrows the differential diagnosis considerably and often suggests specific genetic syndromes or congenital conditions.\n\n**Camptodactyly of toe (HP:0001836)** is even rarer than finger camptodactyly, as the condition predominantly affects fingers rather than toes. This specificity makes it highly informative when present.\n\n**Talipes equinovarus (HP:0001762)**, while more specific than general talipes, represents a particular subtype of clubfoot with four characteristic components: inversion and adduction of the forefoot, inversion of the heel and hindfoot, equinus of the ankle and subtalar joint, and internal rotation of the leg[1]. This specificity increases its diagnostic value.\n\n## Question 3: Gender and Age Group Patterns\n\n### Camptodactyly-Specific Patterns\n\n**Age-related presentation**: Camptodactyly demonstrates distinct age-related patterns. The condition is typically present at birth or becomes evident during childhood, with contractures generally increasing during growth spurts, particularly between ages 1-4 years and 10-14 years[1]. In adolescent presentations, the condition may first become noticeable during these rapid growth periods.\n\n**Gender distribution**: The infantile form of camptodactyly shows **equal sex distribution** between boys and girls[1]. However, when camptodactyly presents in adolescence, **girls are more commonly affected** than boys[1]. This gender difference based on age of presentation is clinically significant.\n\n**Bilateral presentation**: Approximately 2\/3 of patients have bilateral camptodactyly, though the degree of contracture may not be symmetrical[1].\n\n### Other Terms\n\n**Talipes equinovarus** typically presents at birth or is identified in the neonatal period, with no significant gender predilection in most populations, though some ethnic variations exist.\n\n**Downslanted palpebral fissures** and **flexion contractures** are not age or gender-specific in their occurrence, as they appear across multiple conditions affecting different populations.\n\n## Clinical Significance Summary\n\nThe camptodactyly-related terms (HP:0012385, HP:0100490, HP:0001836) are more diagnostically specific and informative, particularly when they appear in combination with other features. Their relative rarity and characteristic presentation make them valuable diagnostic clues. In contrast, flexion contracture and downslanted palpebral fissures are common features across many conditions and require additional clinical context for diagnostic specificity. The age-dependent gender differences in camptodactyly presentation are particularly noteworthy for clinical assessment and genetic counseling.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms Related to Clubfoot and Associated Conditions\n\n## Bilateral Talipes Equinovarus (HP:0001776)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nBilateral talipes equinovarus is a **highly specific and informative term** for clubfoot diagnosis. While clubfoot itself affects approximately 1 in 1,000 babies born, bilateral presentation (affecting both feet) occurs in about half of clubfoot cases[1][2], making it moderately common but highly diagnostic when present.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nThis term is not rare among clubfoot cases but is highly informative because it indicates a specific presentation of the condition. The bilateral form is particularly significant for prognosis and treatment planning, as it requires coordinated management of both feet[1].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nClubfoot is **more common in boys**, occurring twice as often in males as in females[2][6]. The condition is present at birth and should be diagnosed within the first few weeks of life, typically before 2 weeks of age[4]. There is no age group more likely to develop this condition after birth, as it is congenital.\n\n---\n\n## Scoliosis (HP:0002650)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nScoliosis is a **common condition that is less informative for clubfoot specifically**. While scoliosis can occur as an associated finding in some genetic syndromes that also present with clubfoot (such as arthrogryposis), it is not a primary feature of isolated clubfoot[2]. Scoliosis appears in many different conditions and populations, making it a less specific diagnostic marker.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nScoliosis is relatively common in the general population and is not rare. When it appears alongside clubfoot, it typically indicates an underlying syndromic condition rather than isolated clubfoot, making it informative for differential diagnosis but not specific to clubfoot itself.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nScoliosis can develop at various ages and affects both genders, though adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is more common in females. In the context of congenital conditions like clubfoot, scoliosis would be present from birth or early childhood if associated with a syndrome.\n\n---\n\n## Short Neck (HP:0000470)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nShort neck is a **less common finding in isolated clubfoot and is not particularly informative** for clubfoot diagnosis. This term would be more relevant in syndromic presentations where clubfoot occurs alongside other skeletal abnormalities, such as in certain genetic syndromes.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nShort neck is relatively rare as a primary feature and would be informative if present, as it suggests a syndromic condition rather than isolated clubfoot. Its presence would warrant investigation for associated genetic or developmental conditions.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nShort neck, when present in congenital conditions, would be evident from birth or early infancy. There is no specific gender predilection for this finding in the context of clubfoot-associated syndromes.\n\n---\n\n## Limited Wrist Movement (HP:0006248)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nLimited wrist movement is a **less common finding in isolated clubfoot and is not informative** for clubfoot diagnosis. This finding would suggest a more generalized condition affecting multiple joints, such as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, which can present with both clubfoot and limited joint mobility[2].\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nLimited wrist movement is rare in isolated clubfoot but would be highly informative if present, as it indicates a systemic condition affecting multiple joints rather than a localized foot deformity.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nIf present in a congenital condition, limited wrist movement would be evident from birth. There is no specific gender predilection for this finding.\n\n---\n\n## Limitation of Movement at Ankles (HP:0010505)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nLimitation of movement at ankles is **highly common and directly relevant to clubfoot**, making it both common and informative. Clubfoot inherently involves limited ankle mobility due to the shortened Achilles tendon and the turned-in position of the foot[1][3]. This finding is expected in clubfoot and helps characterize the severity of the deformity.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nThis is not a rare finding in clubfoot; it is a defining characteristic. However, it is informative because the degree of ankle limitation helps assess disease severity and treatment response[4].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nAs a feature of clubfoot, ankle limitation would be present from birth and is more common in boys, reflecting the higher incidence of clubfoot in males[1][6]. The limitation typically improves with appropriate treatment during infancy.\n\n---\n\n## Bilateral Camptodactyly (HP:0005617)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nBilateral camptodactyly (permanent flexion of fingers) is a **rare finding in isolated clubfoot and is highly informative** when present. This finding suggests an underlying syndromic condition such as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita rather than isolated clubfoot[2].\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nThis is a rare finding and highly specific for syndromic presentations. Its presence would be very informative for identifying a genetic syndrome affecting multiple joints and tissues.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nIf present in a congenital condition, bilateral camptodactyly would be evident from birth. There is no specific gender predilection for this finding.\n\n---\n\n## Delayed Gross Motor Development (HP:0002194)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nDelayed gross motor development is a **moderately common finding that can be informative in the context of clubfoot**. Children with untreated or inadequately treated clubfoot may experience delayed walking and gross motor milestones[1][3]. However, with appropriate early treatment using the Ponseti method, most children achieve normal gross motor development and walk at the usual age[1].\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nThis finding is not rare but is informative when present, as it indicates either inadequate treatment response or an associated syndromic condition. Most children with properly treated clubfoot do not experience significant gross motor delays[1][4].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nDelayed gross motor development would be most apparent in infants and toddlers (typically 6-24 months of age) when walking milestones are expected. Boys are more likely to have clubfoot and thus potentially experience this delay if treatment is inadequate[1][6]. The delay is typically reversible with appropriate treatment.","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms. Your job is to prepare a mock clinical epicrisis for this sample.\n\nYou're given the following information about the target hpo terms:\n<hpo_info>\n# Analysis of HPO Terms Related to Clubfoot and Associated Conditions\n\n## Bilateral Talipes Equinovarus (HP:0001776)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nBilateral talipes equinovarus is a **highly specific and informative term** for clubfoot diagnosis. While clubfoot itself affects approximately 1 in 1,000 babies born, bilateral presentation (affecting both feet) occurs in about half of clubfoot cases[1][2], making it moderately common but highly diagnostic when present.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nThis term is not rare among clubfoot cases but is highly informative because it indicates a specific presentation of the condition. The bilateral form is particularly significant for prognosis and treatment planning, as it requires coordinated management of both feet[1].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nClubfoot is **more common in boys**, occurring twice as often in males as in females[2][6]. The condition is present at birth and should be diagnosed within the first few weeks of life, typically before 2 weeks of age[4]. There is no age group more likely to develop this condition after birth, as it is congenital.\n\n---\n\n## Scoliosis (HP:0002650)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nScoliosis is a **common condition that is less informative for clubfoot specifically**. While scoliosis can occur as an associated finding in some genetic syndromes that also present with clubfoot (such as arthrogryposis), it is not a primary feature of isolated clubfoot[2]. Scoliosis appears in many different conditions and populations, making it a less specific diagnostic marker.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nScoliosis is relatively common in the general population and is not rare. When it appears alongside clubfoot, it typically indicates an underlying syndromic condition rather than isolated clubfoot, making it informative for differential diagnosis but not specific to clubfoot itself.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nScoliosis can develop at various ages and affects both genders, though adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is more common in females. In the context of congenital conditions like clubfoot, scoliosis would be present from birth or early childhood if associated with a syndrome.\n\n---\n\n## Short Neck (HP:0000470)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nShort neck is a **less common finding in isolated clubfoot and is not particularly informative** for clubfoot diagnosis. This term would be more relevant in syndromic presentations where clubfoot occurs alongside other skeletal abnormalities, such as in certain genetic syndromes.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nShort neck is relatively rare as a primary feature and would be informative if present, as it suggests a syndromic condition rather than isolated clubfoot. Its presence would warrant investigation for associated genetic or developmental conditions.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nShort neck, when present in congenital conditions, would be evident from birth or early infancy. There is no specific gender predilection for this finding in the context of clubfoot-associated syndromes.\n\n---\n\n## Limited Wrist Movement (HP:0006248)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nLimited wrist movement is a **less common finding in isolated clubfoot and is not informative** for clubfoot diagnosis. This finding would suggest a more generalized condition affecting multiple joints, such as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, which can present with both clubfoot and limited joint mobility[2].\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nLimited wrist movement is rare in isolated clubfoot but would be highly informative if present, as it indicates a systemic condition affecting multiple joints rather than a localized foot deformity.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nIf present in a congenital condition, limited wrist movement would be evident from birth. There is no specific gender predilection for this finding.\n\n---\n\n## Limitation of Movement at Ankles (HP:0010505)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nLimitation of movement at ankles is **highly common and directly relevant to clubfoot**, making it both common and informative. Clubfoot inherently involves limited ankle mobility due to the shortened Achilles tendon and the turned-in position of the foot[1][3]. This finding is expected in clubfoot and helps characterize the severity of the deformity.\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nThis is not a rare finding in clubfoot; it is a defining characteristic. However, it is informative because the degree of ankle limitation helps assess disease severity and treatment response[4].\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nAs a feature of clubfoot, ankle limitation would be present from birth and is more common in boys, reflecting the higher incidence of clubfoot in males[1][6]. The limitation typically improves with appropriate treatment during infancy.\n\n---\n\n## Bilateral Camptodactyly (HP:0005617)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nBilateral camptodactyly (permanent flexion of fingers) is a **rare finding in isolated clubfoot and is highly informative** when present. This finding suggests an underlying syndromic condition such as arthrogryposis multiplex congenita rather than isolated clubfoot[2].\n\n**Rarity and Specificity:**\nThis is a rare finding and highly specific for syndromic presentations. Its presence would be very informative for identifying a genetic syndrome affecting multiple joints and tissues.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\nIf present in a congenital condition, bilateral camptodactyly would be evident from birth. There is no specific gender predilection for this finding.\n\n---\n\n## Delayed Gross Motor Development (HP:0002194)\n\n**Commonality and Informativeness:**\nDelayed gross motor development is a **moderately common finding that can be informative in the context of clubfoot**. Children with untreated or inadequately treated clubfoot may experience delayed walking and gross motor milestones[1][3].

Which of these hpo terms are more common and less informative for a specific disease?\n2. Which of these hpo terms are rare and informative for a specific disease?\n3. Is there a spesific gender or age group that is more likely to have these hpo terms?\n","search_results":"# Analysis of HPO Terms: Clinical Significance and Epidemiology\n\n## Seizure (HP:0001250)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative:**\n\nSeizure is a **common and less informative term** for specific disease diagnosis. Up to 10% of people around the world will have at least one seizure during their lifetimes[4]. Seizures can result from numerous causes including stroke, head injury, infection, metabolic disturbances, or underlying neurological conditions. The symptom itself—a sudden burst of electrical activity in the brain causing changes in behavior, movements, feelings, and consciousness[1]—is non-specific and can manifest across many different disorders.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\n\nSeizures can affect anyone at any age[4]. There is no inherent gender predisposition to seizures themselves, though certain seizure-causing conditions may show gender preferences.\n\n---\n\n## Global Developmental Delay (HP:0001263)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative:**\n\nGlobal developmental delay is a **moderately common but moderately informative term**. It indicates a delay in achieving motor or mental milestones across multiple developmental domains (motor skills, speech and language, cognitive skills, and social-emotional skills) in children younger than five years of age. While developmental delays are relatively common in early childhood, the global nature of the delay—affecting multiple domains simultaneously—is more informative than isolated delays and suggests underlying neurological or genetic conditions.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\n\nBy definition, this term applies exclusively to **children younger than five years of age**. There is no inherent gender predisposition, though certain genetic conditions causing global developmental delay may show sex-linked inheritance patterns.\n\n---\n\n## Hypospadias (HP:0000047)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative:**\n\nHypospadias is a **relatively common congenital condition** characterized by abnormal positioning of the urethral meatus on the ventral (underside) surface of the penis rather than at the tip of the glans. While not rare, it is moderately informative as it indicates a specific urogenital developmental abnormality.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\n\nHypospadias is **exclusively a male condition** by definition, as it involves penile anatomy. It is a **congenital condition** present from birth, though it may not be immediately recognized in all cases.\n\n---\n\n## Nystagmus (HP:0000639)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative:**\n\nNystagmus is a **moderately informative term** describing rhythmic, involuntary oscillations of one or both eyes related to abnormalities in fixation, conjugate gaze, or vestibular mechanisms. While nystagmus itself can occur in various conditions (neurological, vestibular, or ophthalmological), its presence indicates dysfunction in specific neural pathways controlling eye movement.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\n\nNystagmus can occur at any age depending on the underlying cause. Some forms of congenital nystagmus present in infancy, while acquired nystagmus can develop at any point in life. There is no inherent gender predisposition.\n\n---\n\n## Hypothyroidism (HP:0000821)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative:**\n\nHypothyroidism is a **common and moderately informative term** indicating deficiency of thyroid hormone. While thyroid dysfunction is relatively common in the general population, hypothyroidism as a symptom can result from multiple etiologies (autoimmune thyroiditis, iodine deficiency, medication side effects, congenital hypothyroidism, etc.), making it less specific for individual disease diagnosis.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\n\nHypothyroidism shows a **strong female predominance**, particularly in autoimmune thyroiditis. It can occur at any age, though congenital hypothyroidism presents from birth and autoimmune forms are more common in adults, particularly middle-aged and older women.\n\n---\n\n## Hydrocephalus (HP:0000238)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative:**\n\nHydrocephalus is a **moderately informative term** describing active distension of the ventricular system resulting from inadequate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) passage from production to absorption. While hydrocephalus itself can result from various causes (obstruction, impaired absorption, overproduction), its presence indicates a specific pathophysiological process affecting CSF dynamics.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\n\nHydrocephalus can occur at any age. Congenital hydrocephalus may present in utero or at birth, while acquired hydrocephalus can develop from trauma, infection, or tumor at any life stage. There is no inherent gender predisposition, though certain causative conditions may show gender preferences.\n\n---\n\n## Obesity (HP:0001513)\n\n**Common vs. Rare and Informative:**\n\nObesity is a **very common and less informative term** for specific disease diagnosis. Accumulation of substantial excess body fat can result from numerous causes including genetic predisposition, metabolic disorders, endocrine dysfunction, medication effects, or lifestyle factors. As a symptom, obesity is non-specific and appears across many different conditions.\n\n**Gender and Age Considerations:**\n\nObesity can occur at any age, from childhood through adulthood. While overall prevalence varies by population, there is no absolute gender predisposition, though some studies show variations in obesity rates between sexes depending on age group and population studied.\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| HPO Term | Specificity | Common\/Rare | Primary Age Group | Gender Considerations |\n|----------|------------|------------|-------------------|----------------------|\n| Seizure | Low | Common (10% lifetime) | Any age | No predisposition |\n| Global Developmental Delay | Moderate | Common | <5 years only | No predisposition |\n| Hypospadias | High | Moderate | Congenital\/birth | Males only |\n| Nystagmus | Moderate | Moderate | Any age | No predisposition |\n| Hypothyroidism | Moderate | Common | Any age | Female predominance |\n| Hydrocephalus | Moderate | Moderate | Any age | No predisposition |\n| Obesity | Low | Very common | Any age | No predisposition |","epicrisis_prompts":"\nYou are a medical expert helping professors to prepare a mock clinical trial for their students.\nIn this sample, there is a list of target hpo terms.
