Autosomal Recessive Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2A (LGMD2A)\n\n**General \/ Common Symptoms:**\n- LGMD2A is characterized primarily by **progressive symmetrical weakness and wasting of proximal muscles**, especially those around the pelvic and shoulder girdles (limb girdles)[7][8].\n- Early symptoms often include **difficulty climbing stairs, frequent falls, difficulty rising from a seated position**, and sometimes inability to stand on toes[5].\n- Muscle pain during exercise, waddling gait, and hypertrophy of deltoid and quadriceps muscles can also be present[7].\n- Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are often elevated, sometimes markedly, reflecting muscle damage[4].\n- The disease onset typically occurs in **childhood or adolescence**, with a median age of symptom onset around 14.5 years in some cohorts[1][3].\n\n**Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms:**\n- Cardiac involvement (dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias) is less common in LGMD2A compared to other LGMD subtypes but can occur[7].\n- Respiratory muscle weakness and nocturnal hypoventilation are generally less prominent early but may develop in advanced stages[7].\n- Facial muscles are usually spared or minimally involved[7].\n- Some patients may have atypical presentations or slower progression, making diagnosis challenging[5].\n\n**Gender or Age Group Predilection:**\n- LGMD2A affects **both males and females equally**[4][8].\n- The typical age of onset is in **childhood or adolescence**, but onset can vary widely even within families[1][5][8].\n- No specific ethnic or racial predilection is strongly noted, though some mutations may be more common in certain populations[1][3].\n\n---\n\n### 2. Autosomal Recessive Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (General)\n\n**General \/ Common Symptoms:**\n- LGMD as a group is defined by **progressive weakness and wasting of proximal limb muscles**, primarily those of the pelvic and shoulder girdles[7][8].\n- Early signs include difficulty with activities requiring proximal muscle strength such as climbing stairs, rising from chairs, and lifting arms[5][7].\n- Symmetrical muscle weakness, elevated serum CK, and dystrophic changes on muscle biopsy are typical[3][4].\n- Disease progression varies from rapid to slow, with some forms causing loss of ambulation within years and others progressing over decades[8].\n\n**Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms:**\n- Cardiac involvement (cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias) occurs in some LGMD subtypes (e.g., 2C-F, 2I, 1B, 1E), but is not universal[7].\n- Respiratory muscle weakness and nocturnal hypoventilation can develop, especially in later stages or specific subtypes[7].\n- Some LGMD forms may have additional features such as muscle pain, hypertrophy, or minimal facial muscle involvement[7].\n- Rare presentations include asymmetric weakness or very late onset forms[4][7].\n\n**Gender or Age Group Predilection:**\n- LGMD affects **males and females equally**[4][8].\n- Age of onset is highly variable, ranging from **childhood through adulthood and even late adulthood**[3][7][8].\n- Autosomal recessive forms (type 2) are more common than dominant forms (type 1)[4][6].\n- Prevalence varies geographically; consanguinity increases risk in some populations (e.g., Turkey)[3].\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Aspect                         | LGMD2A (Autosomal Recessive)                          | LGMD (Autosomal Recessive, General)                   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Common Symptoms**            | Symmetrical proximal muscle weakness; difficulty climbing stairs, rising from seat; muscle wasting; elevated CK; onset ~14.5 years | Symmetrical proximal weakness; difficulty with proximal muscle tasks; elevated CK; variable onset (childhood to adulthood) |\n| **Rare Symptoms**              | Cardiac involvement (less common); respiratory weakness late; facial muscles spared | Cardiac involvement in some subtypes; respiratory weakness; asymmetric weakness rare; facial muscle sparing |\n| **Gender\/Age Predilection**    | Affects males and females equally; onset usually childhood\/adolescence | Affects males and females equally; onset variable from childhood to late adulthood; recessive forms more common |\n| **Prevalence & Demographics**  | No strong ethnic bias; some mutations more common in specific groups | Prevalence varies by region; consanguinity increases risk; prevalence ~1-9 per 100,000 |\n\n---\n\nThis synthesis is based on multiple authoritative sources including clinical reviews, epidemiological studies, and genetic databases[1][3][4][5][6][7][8].

If the muscles extending the hip joint are affected, the posture in that joint becomes flexed and lumbar lordosis increases. The patients usually have difficulties standing up from a sitting position. Due to weakness in the gluteus medius muscle, the hip on the side of the swinging leg drops with each step (referred to as Trendelenburg sign). The gait appears waddling. The patients frequently attempt to counteract the dropping of the hip on the swinging side by bending the trunk towards the side which is in the stance phase (in the German language literature this is referred to as Duchenne sign). Similar gait patterns can be caused by orthopedic conditions when the origin and the insertion site of the gluteus medius muscle are closer to each other than normal, for instance due to a posttraumatic elevation of the trochanter or pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck.\" [PMID:27770207]","synonym":["Waddling gait","Waddling walk"]},{"id":"HP:0003236","name":"Elevated circulating creatine kinase concentration","definition":"\"An elevation of the level of the enzyme creatine kinase (also known as creatine phosphokinase (CK; EC 2.7.3.2) in the blood.
