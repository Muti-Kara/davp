Autosomal Recessive Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2A (LGMD2A)\n\n**General \/ Common Symptoms:**\n- LGMD2A is characterized primarily by **progressive symmetrical weakness and wasting of proximal muscles**, especially those around the pelvic and shoulder girdles (limb girdles)[7][8].\n- Early symptoms often include **difficulty climbing stairs, frequent falls, difficulty rising from a seated position**, and sometimes inability to stand on toes[5].\n- Muscle pain during exercise, waddling gait, and hypertrophy of deltoid and quadriceps muscles can also be present[7].\n- Serum creatine kinase (CK) levels are often elevated, sometimes markedly, reflecting muscle damage[4].\n- The disease onset typically occurs in **childhood or adolescence**, with a median age of symptom onset around 14.5 years in some cohorts[1][3].\n\n**Rare \/ Uncommon Symptoms:**\n- Cardiac involvement (dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias) is less common in LGMD2A compared to other LGMD subtypes but can occur[7].\n- Respiratory muscle weakness and nocturnal hypoventilation are generally less prominent early but may develop in advanced stages[7].\n- Facial muscles are usually spared or minimally involved[7].\n- Some patients may have atypical presentations or slower progression, making diagnosis challenging[5].\n\n**Gender or Age Group Predilection:**\n- LGMD2A affects **both males and females equally**[4][8].\n- The typical age of onset is in **childhood or adolescence**, but onset can vary widely even within families[1][5][8].\n- No specific ethnic or racial predilection is strongly noted, though some mutations may be more common in certain populations[1][3].\n\n---\n\n### 2.
