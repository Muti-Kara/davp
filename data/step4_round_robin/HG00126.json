This gene, along with several associated transcripts and regulatory elements (TF Binding Sites, Histone Modification Sites, ChromHMM States, chr_chain), has been linked to a broad spectrum of phenotypes through GWAS associations.\n\n**GWAS Associations:**\n\nThe genetic entities associated with this variant show strong links to:\n\n*   **Hematological Traits:** Granulocyte percentage of myeloid white cells, monocyte count, monocyte percentage of leukocytes, and basophil count.\n*   **Metabolic and Cardiovascular Risk Factors:** Fibrinogen measurement, triglyceride measurement, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement.\n*   **Behavioral Traits:** Alcohol drinking and alcohol consumption measurement.\n*   **Hormonal and Protein Levels:** Sex hormone-binding globulin measurement, serum albumin measurement, and blood protein measurement.\n*   **Growth Factors:** IGF-1 measurement.\n*   **Hemoglobin Levels:** Hemoglobin measurement.\n\n**ClinVar Associations:**\n\nThe ClinVar database indicates that variants within the analyzed genetic entities, particularly those related to the CAPN3 gene, are strongly associated with **muscular dystrophies**. The most prominent phenotypes reported for non-benign variants include:\n\n*   **Autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A)**, which is the most frequently reported phenotype.\n*   **Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal dominant 4**.\n*   **CAPN3-related disorder**.\n*   **Inborn genetic diseases**.\n*   **Abnormality of the musculature**.\n*   **Muscle weakness**.\n*   **Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, recessive**.\n\nOther associated phenotypes include cardiac arrhythmia, lower-limb joint contractures, calf muscle hypertrophy, shoulder girdle muscle weakness, congenital muscular dystrophy, myopathy, and absent Achilles reflex.\n\n### Pathogenicity Clues\n\nThe variant rs758058910 is classified as **pathogenic** in ClinVar, which is a strong indicator of its potential to cause disease. While the ACMG classification is \"Uncertain significance,\" the overwhelming evidence from ClinVar, particularly the high number of pathogenic variants associated with various forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and CAPN3-related disorders, strongly suggests a pathogenic role for this variant. The association of the CAPN3 gene with these muscular dystrophies, coupled with the pathogenic ClinVar annotation of the variant, points towards a significant risk for these conditions. The GWAS associations with a range of physiological parameters, while broad, do not contradict a role in a complex genetic disorder affecting muscle function.\n\n**In summary, the variant rs758058910, located in or near the CAPN3 gene, is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, particularly autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A.**\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== CAPN3 ===\nCAPN3 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** CAPN3 (HGNC:1480).\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 114240.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy autosomal recessive 1 (LGMDR1, formerly LGMD2A) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy autosomal dominant 4 (LGMDD4).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between *CAPN3* and autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A is classified as \"Definitive\" and \"Strong\".\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Primarily autosomal recessive. An autosomal dominant pattern associated with a milder, later-onset phenotype has also been described.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** In gnomAD v2.1.1, *CAPN3* has a pLI score of 0.00, a pRec score of 0.99, and a pNull score of 9.2e-13. The LOEUF score is 1.25.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variants in the heterozygous state, which is consistent with its primary recessive inheritance pattern. The high pRec score suggests the gene is intolerant to homozygous loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) are established pathogenic mechanisms for the recessive form. Missense mutations are also very common. Specific in-frame deletions and missense variants have been associated with the dominant form.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Proximal muscle weakness (HP:0003701).\n    *   Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (HP:0003236).\n    *   Limb-girdle muscle weakness (HP:0006785).\n    *   Scapular winging (HP:0003691).\n    *   Waddling gait (HP:0002515).\n    *   Difficulty walking (HP:0002355).\n    *   Myopathy (HP:0003198).\n    *   Gait disturbance (HP:0001288).\n    *   Achilles tendon contracture (HP:0001771).\n    *   Calf muscle hypertrophy (HP:0008952).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Myalgia (HP:0003326).\n    *   Flexion contracture (HP:0001371).\n    *   Scoliosis (HP:0002650).\n    *   Distal muscle weakness (HP:0002460).\n    *   Exercise intolerance (HP:0003546).\n    *   Loss of ambulation (HP:0002505).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset for the recessive form (LGMDR1) is typically in late childhood or early adolescence, often between ages 6 and 18. The dominant form (LGMDD4) has a later onset, with an average age of 34 years. Asymptomatic hyper-CK-emia can be a pre-symptomatic finding in children.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity is variable. The recessive form generally leads to loss of ambulation within 20-30 years of onset. The dominant form is typically milder. Null mutations are generally associated with a more severe phenotype.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous or compound heterozygous null variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) are generally associated with a more severe phenotype and complete loss of calpain-3 protein. Patients with at least one missense mutation may have a less severe course.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Pathogenic missense mutations are frequently located in the protease domain (domain II) and domain III. Variants near the calmodulin-binding site have been associated with the autosomal dominant form.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Moderate. While some general correlations exist, such as null variants leading to more severe disease, significant phenotypic variability is observed even among individuals with the same mutations.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   The c.643_663del21 in-frame deletion is associated with autosomal dominant LGMDD4, characterized by later onset, myalgia, and a generally milder phenotype.\n    *   Compound heterozygosity for the c.1746-20C>G variant along with another pathogenic variant often results in a mild-to-moderate phenotype.\n    *   The 2362AG->TCATCT mutation (exon 22) is a frequent cause of LGMDR1 but does not appear to be a specific risk factor for wheelchair dependence at a certain age.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.550delA (p.Thr184Argfs*36) / rs80338814 / Pathogenic /** LGMDR1, proximal muscle weakness, elevated CK.

There is typically no cardiac involvement or intellectual disability.\n*   **Expression During Development:** *CAPN3* is believed to play a role in the early stages of myogenesis (muscle formation) and muscle remodeling.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *CAPN3* encodes calpain-3, a calcium-dependent, non-lysosomal cysteine protease specific to skeletal muscle that plays a role in muscle protein turnover, sarcomere maintenance, and muscle remodeling.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism for recessive LGMDR1 is loss-of-function. For the dominant LGMDD4 associated with the c.643_663del21 variant, a dominant-negative effect on the calpain-3 homodimer has been proposed.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   Disruption of calpain-3's proteolytic activity may lead to the accumulation of damaged proteins and dysregulation of protein turnover in muscle.\n    *   *CAPN3* deficiency can lead to degradation of SERCA proteins, impairing calcium homeostasis and storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n    *   Loss of function can dysregulate the NF-\u03baB pathway, potentially leading to protein degradation, inflammation, and fibrosis in skeletal muscle.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Calpain-3 binds to titin (TTN), a giant protein essential for sarcomere structure and elasticity, which localizes calpain-3 to the sarcomere. This interaction is critical for muscle function and maintenance.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In cohorts of patients with suspected limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, *CAPN3* is one of the most frequently mutated genes, accounting for 17% to 30% of solved cases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** This gene is tested in individuals presenting with progressive proximal muscle weakness, particularly of the shoulder and pelvic girdles, often with scapular winging and elevated serum CK levels.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Management is supportive and includes physical therapy and stretching to maintain mobility and prevent contractures. Genetic diagnosis confirms the specific subtype of LGMD, which is crucial for prognosis and genetic counseling.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Autosomal recessive LGMDR1 carriers are typically asymptomatic. The identification of a dominantly acting *CAPN3* variant has significant implications for genetic counseling, as affected individuals have a 50% chance of passing the condition to their children.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Richard et al. (1995) (PMID: 7720071):** Landmark paper that first identified mutations in the muscle-specific calpain (*CAPN3*) gene as the cause of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A.\n*   **S\u00e1enz et al. (2005) (PMID: 15625251):** A large study of 238 LGMD2A patients that characterized the mutational spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlations, noting a mean onset age of 14 and that mutation type did not clearly correlate with the age of wheelchair dependence.\n*   **Vissing et al. (2016) (PMID: 27259757):** First major study to provide strong evidence for a dominantly inherited form of calpainopathy (LGMDD4) caused by a specific 21-bp in-frame deletion in *CAPN3*, expanding the known inheritance patterns.\n*   **Nallamilli et al. (2018) (PMID: 30127038):** A large US-based study that found *CAPN3* to be the most common gene implicated in their LGMD cohort (17% of cases) and noted an increased prevalence of dominantly inherited forms.\n*   **Reddy et al. (2021) (PMID: 33246816):** A comprehensive study on an Indian cohort that identified 71 novel mutations, highlighting population-specific mutation distribution and observing a slower disease progression compared to European populations.\n*   **Zhang et al. (2021) (PMID: 33964115):** A case study reporting compound heterozygous variants, including a novel deletion, and emphasizing the role of nonsense-mediated decay as a pathogenic mechanism.\n*   **Jalali et al. (2023) (PMID: 36778401):** A recent case report identifying a novel homozygous missense variant (p.Gly221Cys) using WES, demonstrating the continued discovery of new pathogenic variants.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   Biallelic loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) are strongly associated with the classic LGMDR1 phenotype: Limb-girdle muscle weakness (HP:0006785), Proximal muscle weakness (HP:0003701), Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (HP:0003236), and Scapular winging (HP:0003691).\n    *   The heterozygous c.643_663del21 variant is strongly associated with later-onset LGMDD4, with Myalgia (HP:0003326) and back pain being prominent features.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of progressive, symmetric proximal muscle weakness (pelvic and shoulder girdles), prominent scapular winging, and highly elevated CK levels in a patient with a normal heart function and intellect is highly suggestive of a *CAPN3*-related myopathy.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The clinical presentation of calpainopathy can overlap with other limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, such as those caused by mutations in *DYSF* (LGMDR2), *ANO5* (LGMDR12), and *FKRP* (LGMDR9). It can also occasionally mimic facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) or distal myopathies.\n\n",

                "description": "## chr1:21855423C>G Genomic Analysis Report\n\nThis report details the analysis of the genomic variant chr1:21855423C>G (rs543536558) and its potential impact on associated genetic entities.\n\n### Variant Information:\n\n*   **Variant:** chr1:21855423C>G (rs543536558)\n*   **Gene:** HSPG2\n*   **ClinVar Significance:** Uncertain significance\n*   **ACMG Classification:** Uncertain significance\n*   **OMIM:** True\n*   **Population Frequencies:**\n    *   gnomAD Allele Frequency: 1.848e-05\n    *   1KG Frequency: 0.0004\n\n### Genetic Entities and Associated GWAS Data:\n\nThe variant is located within or near the **HSPG2 gene** (ID: 16188052) and its associated transcript (ID: 16424354). It also overlaps with several non-coding RNA entities, histone modification sites, and ChromHMM states.\n\nGWAS associations for variants within these entities are linked to the following phenotypes:\n\n*   **Alkaline phosphatase measurement:** A marker for bone and liver disease.\n*   **Blood phosphate measurement:** Indicating a role in phosphorus levels.\n*   **Body height:** Suggesting a potential influence on stature.\n*   **Age at onset:** Implies a possible role in determining when a condition may manifest.\n*   **Obsolete Alzheimer's disease:** Associated with neurodegenerative processes and dementia.\n*   **FEV/FEC ratio:** Related to lung function.\n\n### ClinVar Data and Phenotype Associations:\n\nThe ClinVar database contains a substantial number of variants within the analyzed genetic entities, with a significant proportion classified as \"Uncertain significance\" (10091 variants). While there are also pathogenic and benign variants, the high number of uncertain significance variants highlights the complexity of interpreting variants in this region.\n\nThe non-benign variants in this region are strongly associated with a range of **inborn genetic diseases**, with a particular emphasis on:\n\n*   **Hypophosphatasia:** This is a recurring theme, with associations to infantile, childhood, adult, and general hypophosphatasia. This is further supported by associations with \"ALPL-related disorder\" and \"Decreased circulating alkaline phosphatase activity.\"\n*   **Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (types 1 and general):** This is another prominent phenotype, often appearing in conjunction with hypophosphatasia and Kniest-like syndrome.\n*   **Lethal Kniest-like syndrome:** Frequently observed alongside Schwartz-Jampel syndrome and other connective tissue disorders.\n*   **Connective tissue disorders:** A broader category that encompasses several of the more specific syndromes.\n*   **Qualitative or quantitative defects of perlecan:** This directly relates to the function of HSPG2, which encodes perlecan.\n*   **Microcephaly** and **Abnormal facial shape** are also noted.\n\n### Clues to Pathogenicity:\n\nThe variant rs543536558 is classified as \"uncertain significance\" in ClinVar. However, its location within the **HSPG2 gene**, which encodes perlecan, is highly significant. Perlecan is a crucial component of the extracellular matrix and plays a vital role in skeletal development, connective tissues, and basement membranes.\n\nThe strong and consistent association of variants within the HSPG2 locus in ClinVar with **hypophosphatasia, Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, and Lethal Kniest-like syndrome** provides a compelling rationale for investigating this variant further. These syndromes are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, connective tissue defects, and often metabolic disturbances related to alkaline phosphatase.\n\nThe GWAS associations with alkaline phosphatase measurement and blood phosphate measurement further support a potential role for variants in this region in metabolic bone diseases. While the variant itself is currently of uncertain significance, its genomic context and the established pathogenicity of other variants in the HSPG2 gene strongly suggest that chr1:21855423C>G could be pathogenic and contribute to phenotypes related to skeletal development, connective tissue integrity, and mineral metabolism. Further functional studies would be beneficial to definitively determine its pathogenicity.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== HSPG2 ===\nHSPG2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 5273.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 142461.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, type 1 (SJS1) (OMIM #255800) and Dyssegmental Dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (DDSH) (OMIM #224410).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Mutations in HSPG2 are definitively associated with SJS1 and DDSH.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Both SJS1 and DDSH are autosomal recessive disorders. Compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations are required to cause a clinical phenotype.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) score is 0.34. The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score is not typically high for recessive genes.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The LOEUF score is near the threshold of <0.35, which suggests the gene is somewhat tolerant of loss-of-function alleles, consistent with its recessive inheritance pattern where the loss of a single copy is not lethal.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Pathogenic variants include missense, nonsense, splice-site, and frameshift mutations. Functional null mutations that prevent perlecan secretion are associated with the most severe phenotype (DDSH).\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms (ranked by general frequency in literature):**\n    *   Short stature (HP:0004322).\n    *   Myotonia (HP:0001053).\n    *   Joint contracture (HP:0001371).\n    *   Kyphoscoliosis (HP:0002751).\n    *   Blepharophimosis (HP:0000644).\n    *   Disproportionate short-limb short stature (HP:0008873).\n    *   Flat face (HP:0012368).\n    *   Bowing of the long bones (HP:0006487).\n    *   Pectus carinatum (HP:0000916).\n    *   Micrognathia (HP:0000347).\n    *   Mask-like facies (HP:0000298).\n    *   Anisospondyly (HP:0003306).\n    *   Abnormal femoral epiphysis morphology (HP:0006499).\n    *   Encephalocele (HP:0002084).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Myopia (HP:0000545).\n    *   Low-set ears (HP:0000369).\n    *   Mental retardation (in ~25% of SJS1 cases) (HP:0001249).\n    *   Idiopathic scoliosis (potential association) (HP:0002650).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** DDSH is a neonatal lethal condition. SJS1 typically manifests with myotonia-related phenotypes in early life.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotypic spectrum ranges from the relatively milder SJS to the perinatally lethal DDSH. The severity inversely correlates with the amount of functional perlecan secreted into the extracellular matrix.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Functional null mutations (e.g., frameshift, nonsense, or splice-site variants leading to no protein secretion) cause the severe, lethal DDSH phenotype. Hypomorphic mutations (missense or splice-site) that reduce, but do not eliminate, the secretion of functional perlecan result in the milder SJS phenotype.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** While no definitive domain-specific correlation has been established, mutations are distributed across the gene's 97 exons. The specific location and type of mutation influence the amount of functional protein produced, which dictates the severity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** There is a strong correlation between the residual function of perlecan and the clinical severity. Complete loss-of-function leads to DDSH, while partial loss leads to SJS. However, within SJS, a clear genotype-phenotype correlation is not yet apparent.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   Homozygous 89-bp duplication in exon 34 (domain III) leads to a null phenotype, causing DDSH.\n    *   Compound heterozygous mutations c.8788G>A (p.Glu2930Lys) and c.11671+5G>A were identified in a patient with SJS1.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1125C>G (p.Cys375Trp):** Pathogenic for Schwartz-Jampel syndrome; reported to cause more neuromuscular instability and relatively mild skeletal abnormalities.\n*   **c.3888+1G>A:** Pathogenic splice variant leading to skipping of exon 31, associated with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **c.8464G>A (p.Gly2822Ser):** Pathogenic mutation leading to skipping of exon 64, associated with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **c.6001dupC (p.Arg2001Profs*19):** Pathogenic frameshift variant associated with Dyssegmental Dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type.\n*   **c.11207G>A (p.Arg3736Gln):** Pathogenic missense variant associated with Dyssegmental Dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type.\n*   **c.8788G>A (p.Glu2930Lys):** Novel mutation reported in a patient with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **c.11671+5G>A:** Novel splice variant reported in a patient with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **p.Asn786Ser:** This variant is potentially associated with idiopathic scoliosis.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** Null mutations (e.g., frameshifts and certain splice-site variants) are strongly correlated with the lethal DDSH phenotype.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** HSPG2 is widely expressed, particularly in cartilage, bone marrow, and skeletal muscle, which aligns with the observed musculoskeletal phenotypes. It is also a key component of all basement membranes, including those in the heart and brain. The GTEx portal shows high expression in arteries, heart, and muscle tissue.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in musculoskeletal tissues correlates with chondrodysplasia and myotonia. Expression in heart and brain basement membranes is critical, and its absence in null mice leads to embryonic lethality due to heart and brain defects.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Perlecan plays vital roles in the development of cardiovascular, neural, and cartilaginous tissues. Its proper expression is critical for cartilage formation and bone development.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** Perlecan is a large, multi-domain heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is a critical structural component of all basement membranes and the extracellular matrix, involved in maintaining tissue integrity and regulating signaling pathways.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is loss-of-function. Complete loss-of-function results in DDSH, while partial loss-of-function (hypomorphism) results in SJS.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Integrity:** Disruption of ECM assembly in cartilage and bone leads to chondrodysplasia and skeletal abnormalities. In muscle, it impairs neuromuscular function.\n    *   **Signaling Pathways:** Perlecan binds to and modulates growth factors (like FGF), which is essential for normal development and cell proliferation. Its absence disrupts endochondral ossification and chondrocyte proliferation.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Perlecan interacts with numerous ECM components like laminin, collagen type IV, and cell-surface molecules, which is essential for the stabilization of basement membranes.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** For patients presenting with the classic and severe features of DDSH or SJS, sequencing of *HSPG2* has a high diagnostic yield.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is indicated for individuals with prenatal findings of severe skeletal dysplasia (such as short and bowed limbs, anisospondyly) or postnatal presentation of myotonia combined with skeletal abnormalities (short stature, joint contractures, specific facial features).\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** For SJS, management is symptomatic and may include physical therapy and medications like procainamide to help with muscle function. For DDSH, there is no treatment, and the condition is lethal. Prenatal diagnosis is crucial for genetic counseling.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** SJS and DDSH are autosomal recessive conditions. Parents of an affected child are obligate carriers, and there is a 25% recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Arikawa-Hirasawa et al., 2001 (PMID: 11101850):** A landmark study that first identified perlecan-null mutations in patients with the lethal DDSH, establishing the link between complete loss of perlecan and the severe skeletal dysplasia phenotype.\n*   **Nicole et al., 2000 (PMID: 11101850):** First reported that mutations in *HSPG2* are the cause of Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, linking partial loss of perlecan function to the SJS phenotype.\n*   **Martinez et al., 2018 (PMID: 30453535):** A comprehensive review summarizing mutations, phenotypes, and functions of perlecan, highlighting the genotype-phenotype correlation where severity is inversely related to the amount of secreted perlecan.\n*   **Chen et al., 2018 (PMID: 29882736):** A case report identifying novel compound heterozygous mutations in *HSPG2* causing SJS1, demonstrating the utility of whole-exome sequencing in diagnosing cases and expanding the mutational spectrum.\n*   **Bas-Sodupe et al., 2023 (PMID: 37682335):** Reported a novel splice mutation in a Moroccan child with SJS1 and reviewed the literature, confirming clinical hallmarks and noting that genotype-phenotype correlation remains challenging for SJS1.\n*   **Liao et al., 2021 (PMID: 34504886):** A report of prenatal identification of novel *HSPG2* variants causing DDSH, emphasizing the importance of early and accurate prenatal diagnosis.\n*   **Wang et al., 2021 (PMID: 33763435):** Identified a new pathogenic missense mutation causing SJS and noted that these patients showed more neuromuscular instability with relatively milder skeletal abnormalities, adding to the genotype-phenotype database.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   **Null mutations (frameshift, nonsense, canonical splice site):** Strongly associated with a severe phenotype including Anisospondyly (HP:0003306), Bowing of the long bones (HP:0006487), Encephalocele (HP:0002084), and is typically neonatally lethal (DDSH).\n    *   **Hypomorphic mutations (missense, non-canonical splice site):** Typically cause a phenotype characterized by Myotonia (HP:0001053), Joint contracture (HP:0001371), Short stature (HP:0004322), and Blepharophimosis (HP:0000644) (SJS).\n*   **Phenotype red flags (HPO terms that strongly suggest pathogenic variants in this gene):**\n    *   The combination of **Myotonia (HP:0001053)** and **Chondrodysplasia (HP:0000910)** is highly suggestive of SJS due to *HSPG2* mutations.\n    *   Prenatal findings of severe, disproportionate short-limb dwarfism with **Anisospondyly (HP:0003306)** are a strong indicator for DDSH caused by *HSPG2* mutations.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The skeletal dysplasia features can overlap with other chondrodysplasias. The myotonia in SJS needs to be distinguished from other myotonic disorders, though the combination with skeletal abnormalities is characteristic.\n\n",

The population frequencies are relatively low but not negligible.\n\n### Genetic Entities and Associated Data:\n\nThe variant rs13078881 is located within or near the **BTD gene** and several **transcript entities** associated with it. Additionally, **Histone Modification Sites**, **ChromHMM States**, and a **chr_chain** entity are also linked.\n\n**Summary of Associated GWAS and ClinVar Data:**\n\nThe **BTD gene** and its associated transcripts are linked to a broad spectrum of GWAS associations, primarily revolving around **cardiovascular health** and **metabolic traits**. These include:\n\n*   **Cardiovascular Diseases:** Coronary artery disease (CAD), acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n*   **Metabolic and Anthropometric Traits:** Triglyceride measurement, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), type II diabetes mellitus, mean platelet volume.\n*   **Other Conditions:** Psoriasis, diarrhea, diverticular disease.\n*   **Physiological Measurements:** Electrocardiography, platelet count.\n*   **Drug Response:** Response to darapladib (a cardiovascular drug).\n\nThe **Histone Modification Sites** and **ChromHMM States** are predominantly associated with **diverticular disease** and a mix of cardiovascular and metabolic traits, as well as psoriasis and diarrhea.\n\n**ClinVar data** overwhelmingly associates variants within the BTD gene with **Biotinidase deficiency**. This is a severe inborn genetic disorder with a range of associated phenotypes, including:\n\n*   **Primary Phenotype:** Biotinidase deficiency (n=14590)\n*   **Broader Categories:** Inborn genetic diseases (n=1317), BTD-related disorder (n=55)\n*   **Neurological Manifestations:** Intellectual disability (n=34), Global developmental delay (n=42), Generalized hypotonia (n=21)\n*   **Other Phenotypes:** Cryptorchidism (n=21), Macrocephaly (n=21)\n\n### Clues to Pathogenicity and Disease Association:\n\n1.  **Strong ClinVar Association with Biotinidase Deficiency:** The most compelling evidence for pathogenicity comes from ClinVar, where numerous variants within the BTD gene are classified as pathogenic and strongly linked to Biotinidase deficiency. This is a well-established genetic disorder. The presence of this variant in the BTD gene, coupled with its pathogenic ClinVar annotations, strongly suggests a potential role in Biotinidase deficiency.\n\n2.  **Conflicting Classifications:** The discrepancy between the ClinVar pathogenic/likely pathogenic classification and the ACMG Benign classification for rs13078881 itself is a critical point. This suggests that while other variants in the BTD gene are clearly pathogenic for Biotinidase deficiency, the specific impact of rs13078881 might be debated or require further functional validation.\n\n3.  **GWAS Associations with Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases:** The extensive GWAS associations of the BTD gene with cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders (like type II diabetes), and related traits (BMI, triglycerides) suggest a broader role for BTD in human health beyond just biotinidase activity. While these are complex traits influenced by many genes, the consistent association of BTD with these conditions indicates its involvement in pathways relevant to these diseases.\n\n4.  **Potential for Pleiotropy:** The wide range of phenotypes associated with BTD variants in ClinVar (from neurological to developmental issues) and the diverse GWAS associations (cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory) suggest that the BTD gene may have pleiotropic effects, influencing multiple biological pathways.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe variant rs13078881 is located in the **BTD gene**, which is strongly associated with **Biotinidase deficiency** in ClinVar. While the specific classification of rs13078881 is conflicting (ClinVar pathogenic vs. ACMG benign), the overall evidence from ClinVar for the BTD gene points towards a significant role in **Biotinidase deficiency** and related inborn genetic disorders, often manifesting with neurological and developmental issues.\n\nFurthermore, the BTD gene's involvement in numerous GWAS studies related to **cardiovascular diseases**, **metabolic disorders**, and **anthropometric traits** suggests a broader impact on human health. The patient's phenotype should be carefully evaluated for symptoms consistent with Biotinidase deficiency, and consideration should be given to potential contributions to cardiovascular and metabolic health risks. Further functional studies may be necessary to definitively resolve the pathogenicity of rs13078881 itself.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== BTD ===\nBTD Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: BTD (biotinidase)**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID**: 1122.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID**: 609019.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations**: Biotinidase deficiency (OMIM: 253260), an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: Definitive.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns**: Autosomal recessive inheritance is the established pattern for biotinidase deficiency.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: Specific constraint scores for the BTD gene were not available in the searched literature.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: While specific scores are unavailable, the nature of the disease suggests intolerance to loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Loss-of-function variants such as deletions, insertions, and nonsense mutations are more likely to result in profound biotinidase deficiency. Missense mutations are also very common.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n    *   Hypotonia (HP:0001252).\n    *   Alopecia (HP:0001596).\n    *   Ataxia (HP:0001251).\n    *   Eczematous dermatitis (HP:0000970).\n    *   Hearing impairment (HP:0000365).\n    *   Developmental delay (HP:0001263).\n    *   Optic atrophy (HP:0000648).\n    *   Ketoacidosis (HP:0001946).\n    *   Lactic acidosis (HP:0003128).\n    *   Hyperammonemia (HP:0001987).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**\n    *   Conjunctivitis (HP:0000509).\n    *   Cutaneous candidiasis (HP:0001557).\n    *   Laryngeal stridor (HP:0001607).\n    *   Apnea (HP:0002104).\n    *   Hyperventilation (HP:0002879).\n    *   Dry skin (HP:0000958).\n    *   Frontal baldness (HP:0002291).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: Signs and symptoms typically appear within the first few months of life, but onset can occur later in childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Severity correlates with residual enzyme activity.\n    *   **Profound deficiency**: Less than 10% of normal serum biotinidase activity, leading to neurological and cutaneous symptoms if untreated.\n    *   **Partial deficiency**: Between 10% and 30% of normal activity; individuals may be asymptomatic or develop mild symptoms during times of stress, such as infection.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: Biallelic loss-of-function variants (e.g., deletions, insertions, nonsense) typically cause profound biotinidase deficiency, whereas some missense variants lead to partial deficiency.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: Mutations in the C-terminus of the BTD protein are associated with a severe loss of enzyme activity and profound deficiency. Most missense mutations are located in exon 4.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: The correlation is moderate; while profound deficiency alleles generally lead to severe symptoms if untreated, some variability exists.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes**:\n    *   The common c.1330G>C (p.D444H) variant results in a protein with variable activity and is often associated with partial deficiency or milder phenotypes, especially when in a compound heterozygous state. It is frequently found in patients with dermatological symptoms.\n    *   The c.470G>A (p.R157H) mutation is the second most common variant and is often observed in symptomatic patients, particularly those with dermatitis.\n    *   Mutations such as p.Leu40Pro and p.Cys160Tyr are considered deleterious and associated with profound deficiency.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n| rsID / HGVS / ClinVar Significance | Reported Phenotypes (HPO terms inferred) | Allele Freq.

It is also expressed in the lung, skeletal muscle, pancreas, heart, brain, and placenta.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: High expression in the liver and kidneys is consistent with the gene's central role in systemic metabolic recycling of biotin. Expression in the brain correlates with the severe neurological phenotypes (seizures, ataxia, hypotonia) seen in untreated patients.\n*   **Expression During Development**: The appearance of symptoms in early infancy if untreated underscores the critical role of biotin recycling during early development.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: The BTD gene encodes the enzyme biotinidase, which recycles the B vitamin biotin by cleaving it from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: Pathogenic variants in *BTD* cause a loss of function, leading to an inability to recycle biotin.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**: The resulting shortage of free biotin impairs the function of four essential biotin-dependent carboxylases.\n    *   **Phenotype Consequences**: This impairment disrupts critical metabolic pathways, including fatty acid synthesis, amino acid catabolism, and gluconeogenesis, leading to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, ketoacidosis, and the diverse neurological and cutaneous symptoms of the disease.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: Biotinidase acts on biocytin, the degradation product of holocarboxylases, to release biotin and lysine, which is essential for maintaining the body's free biotin pool.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield**: Diagnostic yield is very high, particularly in regions with newborn screening programs for biotinidase deficiency, which identify most cases before symptom onset.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing**: Testing is prompted by positive newborn screening results or the presentation of clinical symptoms such as seizures, hypotonia, and skin rash in an infant.\n*   **Clinical Actionability**: The disease is highly treatable. Lifelong oral supplementation with free biotin can prevent all symptoms if started early and can improve or resolve existing symptoms.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling should address the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, explaining that affected individuals have two pathogenic *BTD* variants and their parents are typically asymptomatic carriers.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n| PMID / Link | Year | Key Phenotype Findings |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 34273891 | 2021 | Identified p.D444H and p.R157H as the most frequent mutations in a Turkish cohort, with dermatitis being a common finding in symptomatic patients. |\n| 35845946 | 2022 | Review summarizing that C-terminus mutations often cause profound deficiency and that genotype does not always correlate perfectly with phenotype. |\n| GeneReviews | 2023 | Differentiates between profound deficiency (often from null alleles) and partial deficiency, outlining the distinct clinical features and management strategies. |\n| 23099232 | 2011 | Description of a public database for BTD mutations, noting over 165 reported variants and defining profound vs. partial deficiency based on enzyme activity. |\n| 12359137 | 2002 | Reported 17 novel mutations that cause profound biotinidase deficiency, expanding the known pathogenic variant spectrum. |\n| 36757655 | 2023 | Overview of pathophysiology, noting that CNS findings can resemble Wernicke encephalopathy or Leigh syndrome, with widespread effects on myelin. |\n| 9654207 | 1998 | Early study on the common p.D444H variant, linking it to partial biotinidase deficiency. |\n| PMC3058810 | 2010 | Developed a database characterizing known BTD mutations and associated phenotypes to aid in interpretation and establish genotype-phenotype correlations. |\n| 36780183 | 2023 | Reviews early detection through newborn screening and lifelong biotin therapy as essential for preventing symptoms. |\n| 34273891 | 2021 | Found that p.D444H and p.R157H mutations accounted for over 66% of alleles in symptomatic patients, most of whom had dermatological findings. |\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**:\n    *   Biallelic null variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, large deletions) are strongly associated with profound biotinidase deficiency and a severe phenotype if untreated, including seizures (HP:0001250), hypotonia (HP:0001252), and ataxia (HP:0001251).\n    *   Homozygous or compound heterozygous p.D444H (c.1330G>C) variants are typically associated with partial biotinidase deficiency, which may be asymptomatic or present with mild dermatitis (HP:0000970) under stress.\n    *   The p.R157H (c.470G>A) variant is strongly associated with symptomatic disease, including prominent dermatological findings.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags**: The combination of early-onset neurological symptoms (seizures, hypotonia, ataxia) with characteristic cutaneous findings (eczematous rash, alopecia) is highly suggestive of profound biotinidase deficiency.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**:\n    *   **Holocarboxylase Synthetase (HCS) Deficiency**: Presents with similar clinical and biochemical findings of multiple carboxylase deficiency, but onset is typically neonatal rather than in early infancy.\n    *   **Nutritional Biotin Deficiency**: Can be caused by diets high in raw eggs (which contain avidin, a biotin-binding protein) or by long-term parenteral nutrition without biotin supplementation.\n\n",

Additionally, it is associated with numerous **TF Binding Sites**, **Histone Modification Sites**, **DNase Hypersensitivity Sites**, **ChromHMM States**, and a **chr_chain** entity.\n\n**GWAS Associations:**\n\nThe genetic entities associated with this variant show strong enrichment for traits related to kidney function and mineral metabolism. Key associated phenotypes from GWAS include:\n\n*   **Kidney Function:** Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), creatinine measurement, chronic kidney disease.\n*   **Mineral Metabolism:** Phosphorus measurement, magnesium:calcium ratio.\n*   **Hematological Traits:** Hematocrit, hemoglobin measurement, red blood cell density measurement, erythrocyte count.\n*   **Other Conditions:** Acute myeloid leukemia, diabetes mellitus, and asthma (obsolete).\n\nThe sheer number of TF Binding Sites and Histone Modification Sites linked to **creatinine measurement** (GWAS_EFO_0004518) and **glomerular filtration rate** (GWAS_EFO_0005208) suggests a significant regulatory role for this genomic region concerning kidney function.\n\n**ClinVar Associations:**\n\nThe **SLC34A1 gene** is strongly associated with several genetic disorders, primarily affecting kidney and bone health. Non-benign variants in this gene are linked to:\n\n*   **SLC34A1-related disorder:** A broad category encompassing several specific conditions.\n*   **Hypercalcemia, infantile, 2:** Characterized by elevated calcium levels in infants.\n*   **Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2:** A disorder affecting the kidney tubules, leading to impaired reabsorption of various substances.\n*   **Hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis 1:** Associated with low phosphate levels, kidney stones, and bone abnormalities.\n*   **Inborn genetic diseases:** A general classification for inherited disorders.\n*   **Nephrocalcinosis:** Calcium deposits in the kidneys.\n*   **Nephrolithiasis:** Kidney stones.\n*   **Prostate cancer:** Notably, this is a less common association but present.\n*   **Osteogenesis imperfecta type III:** A severe form of brittle bone disease.\n*   **Large for gestational age:** A growth parameter.\n\nThe high number of variants with \"uncertain significance\" in ClinVar (3131 out of 6725 total analyzed) for this gene highlights the complexity in interpreting the pathogenicity of variants within SLC34A1. However, the substantial number of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (1389) associated with severe kidney and bone disorders is highly significant.\n\n### Clues to Pathogenicity:\n\nThe variant rs141770901 is located in the **SLC34A1 gene**, which is well-established to be involved in phosphate and calcium transport. The strong association of this gene with severe kidney disorders (Fanconi renotubular syndrome, chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis) and metabolic bone diseases (hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis, hypercalcemia) through ClinVar data provides a strong biological rationale for potential pathogenicity.\n\nThe GWAS data further supports the involvement of this genomic region in kidney function (GFR, creatinine) and mineral metabolism (phosphorus). The presence of numerous TF binding sites and histone modification sites in this region, particularly those linked to creatinine measurement and GFR, suggests that variants here could disrupt the regulatory control of SLC34A1 or nearby genes critical for kidney function.\n\nWhile the variant itself is classified as \"uncertain significance\" in ClinVar, its location within a gene with a clear and significant role in kidney and bone homeostasis, coupled with the strong GWAS associations with related phenotypes, raises suspicion. The low population frequency also makes it less likely to be a benign variant. Further investigation into the functional impact of this specific variant on SLC34A1 expression or function would be crucial for a definitive assessment of its pathogenicity. The pattern of associated diseases points towards a potential role in disorders of mineral metabolism and kidney function.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== SLC34A1 ===\nSLC34A1 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 11019\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 182309\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:**\n    *   Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 (FRTS2) [MIM:613388]\n    *   Infantile hypercalcemia 2 (HCINF2) [MIM:616963]\n    *   Hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis 1 (NPHLOP1) [MIM:612286]\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The gene-disease relationship is rated as \"Strong\" for autosomal recessive Infantile hypercalcemia 2.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant patterns are observed.\n    *   Biallelic loss-of-function mutations typically cause autosomal recessive disorders like infantile hypercalcemia or Fanconi renotubular syndrome.\n    *   Monoallelic (heterozygous) mutations are associated with autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis or osteoporosis.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **gnomAD v2.1.1 Scores:**\n    *   **pLI:** 4.19e-10 (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant is near zero).\n    *   **LOEUF:** 1.10 (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction).\n    *   **pRec:** 0.00\n    *   **pNull:** 1.00\n*   **Clinical Interpretation:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that *SLC34A1* is tolerant to heterozygous loss-of-function variation, which is consistent with the recessive inheritance pattern of severe disease. The dominant phenotype is not caused by simple haploinsufficiency.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Biallelic missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations are associated with recessive disease.

Biallelic mutations are associated with a more severe, early-onset phenotype compared to monoallelic mutations. Digenic inheritance of heterozygous mutations in both *SLC34A1* and *SLC34A3* can result in a more severe phenotype than a single heterozygous mutation.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Biallelic Variants:** Typically cause autosomal recessive infantile hypercalcemia or Fanconi-like syndrome with severe renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and subsequent hypercalcemia.\n*   **Monoallelic Variants:** Cause a milder, autosomal dominant phenotype of hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis and/or osteoporosis, often presenting in adulthood.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Strong. There is a clear distinction between the severe, recessive phenotypes caused by biallelic mutations and the milder, dominant phenotypes caused by heterozygous mutations.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   **p.I456N (heterozygous):** Associated with autosomal dominant renal stone disease.\n    *   **p.R512C and p.V91A97del (compound heterozygous):** Associated with an autosomal recessive Fanconi-like syndrome with metabolic acidosis and renal stones.\n    *   **p.Gly543Cys (heterozygous):** A novel variant associated with recurrent nephrolithiasis and early-onset osteopenia.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n| HGVS / rsID | ClinVar Significance | Reported Phenotypes (HPO Terms) | Allele Frequency (gnomAD) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| p.Val408Glu / rs140649226 | Pathogenic | Hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis 1, Infantile hypercalcemia 2 | 0.00011 |\n| p.Ile456Asn | Pathogenic | Hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis | Not reported |\n| p.Arg512Cys / rs769018485 | Pathogenic | Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 | Very rare |\n| p.V91_A97del | Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic | Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 | More common |\n| p.Arg512His / rs199679198 | Pathogenic | Hypophosphatemic rickets, Hypercalciuria | 0.000008 |\n| p.Gly543Cys | Uncertain Significance | Nephrolithiasis, Osteopenia | Not reported |\n| p.Thr138Met | Pathogenic | Infantile hypercalcemia 2 | Not reported |\n| p.Val147Met | Pathogenic | Infantile hypercalcemia 2 | Not reported |\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues:** The highest expression of *SLC34A1* is in the kidney cortex, according to GTEx data.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes:** The kidney-specific expression of the NaPi-IIa protein explains why phenotypes are primarily renal, including defective phosphate reabsorption, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Clinical presentations in early infancy suggest the gene is critical for phosphate homeostasis from birth.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The *SLC34A1* gene encodes the sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter 2A (NaPi-IIa), which is critical for reabsorbing phosphate from the glomerular filtrate in the kidney's proximal tubule.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:**\n    *   **Recessive (Loss-of-Function):** Biallelic mutations lead to a loss of NaPi-IIa transporter function, causing renal phosphate wasting. This results in hypophosphatemia, which stimulates 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 production, leading to increased intestinal calcium absorption and subsequent hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.\n    *   **Dominant:** The mechanism for dominant disease is less clear but may involve trafficking defects or a dominant-negative effect where the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** The primary pathway disrupted is sodium-coupled phosphate transport in the renal brush border membrane. This dysregulation of phosphate homeostasis has downstream effects on the vitamin D metabolic pathway.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** In a cohort of patients with a history suggestive of hypersensitivity to vitamin D (hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria), mutations in *SLC34A1* were identified in 1-8% of cases, less frequently than *CYP24A1* mutations.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** The gene is tested in cases of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia, Fanconi syndrome, and unexplained hypophosphatemia, nephrolithiasis, or early-onset osteoporosis.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management:** Management is often personalized due to phenotype variability. It includes hyperhydration, dietary modifications (low sodium, appropriate calcium), and potentially phosphate supplementation, which can rapidly resolve hypercalcemia in infants with biallelic mutations.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Both autosomal recessive and dominant inheritance must be considered. Heterozygous carriers of a recessive allele may be asymptomatic or have mild biochemical changes. The possibility of digenic inheritance with *SLC34A3* should be considered in complex cases.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n| PMID / DOI | Year | Key Phenotype Findings |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 26047794 | 2016 | Established that biallelic, autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in *SLC34A1* cause idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH), characterized by renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and hypercalcemia. |\n| 29924459 | 2018 | Detailed cases illustrating both autosomal dominant (hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis) and autosomal recessive (Fanconi-like syndrome) phenotypes, linking them to specific mutations and cellular trafficking defects. |\n| 28470390 | 2017 | Described a family with digenic heterozygous mutations in *SLC34A1* and *SLC34A3* causing a more severe phenotype of hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria than either heterozygous mutation alone. |\n| 12324554 | 2002 | A landmark paper that first linked heterozygous mutations in *SLC34A1* to patients with urolithiasis or osteoporosis and idiopathic hypophosphatemia. |\n| 31188746 | 2019 | Review summarizing the overlapping phenotypes caused by *CYP24A1* and *SLC34A1* defects, highlighting hypophosphatemia as a key distinguishing feature for *SLC34A1*-related disease. |\n| 38084227 | 2023 | Case report of a novel heterozygous *SLC34A1* mutation (p.Gly543Cys) causing recurrent nephrolithiasis and early-onset osteopenia, expanding the variant spectrum for the dominant phenotype. |\n| 34733333 | 2021 | Cohort study showing overlapping phenotypes between *CYP24A1*, *SLC34A1*, and *SLC34A3* mutations, suggesting broad genetic screening for patients with hypersensitivity to vitamin D. |\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:**\n    *   **Biallelic loss-of-function variants \u2192** Severe infantile-onset phenotype including Hypercalcemia (HP:0003072), Hypophosphatemia (HP:0002148), Failure to thrive (HP:0001508), and Nephrocalcinosis (HP:0000121).\n    *   **Monoallelic missense variants \u2192** Milder, often adult-onset phenotype dominated by Nephrolithiasis (HP:0000787) and/or Decreased bone mineral density (HP:0000938).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:**\n    *   The combination of **Hypophosphatemia (HP:0002148)** with **Hypercalcemia (HP:0003072)** in an infant is highly suggestive of biallelic *SLC34A1* mutations.\n    *   Idiopathic **Hypercalciuria (HP:0003471)** with **Hypophosphatemia (HP:0002148)** in an adult with kidney stones or osteoporosis points towards monoallelic *SLC34A1* mutations.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**\n    *   **CYP24A1:** Mutations also cause infantile hypercalcemia, but typically without the prominent hypophosphatemia seen in *SLC34A1* cases.\n    *   **SLC34A3 (NPT2c):** Mutations can cause hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH).

These entities are linked to a broad spectrum of GWAS associations.\n\n#### Gene: BSN (ID: 16176753)\n\nThe BSN gene is associated with a wide array of GWAS traits, indicating its potential involvement in diverse biological processes. These include:\n\n*   **Metabolic and Inflammatory Markers:** C-reactive protein measurement (inflammation), cystatin C measurement (kidney function), HbA1c measurement (blood glucose), creatinine measurement (kidney function), glomerular filtration rate, glucose measurement, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and blood protein measurement.\n*   **Cognitive and Educational Traits:** Self-reported educational attainment, intelligence, cognitive function measurement, mathematical ability.\n*   **Reproductive and Developmental Traits:** Age at menarche.\n*   **Socioeconomic Factors:** Household income.\n*   **Hematological Parameters:** Reticulocyte count, reticulocyte measurement.\n*   **Disease Susceptibility:** Prostate carcinoma, ulcerative colitis, sclerosing cholangitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, childhood ear infection susceptibility, coronary artery disease, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis.\n*   **Anthropometric Measures:** Body mass index, BMI-adjusted waist-hip ratio, BMI-adjusted waist circumference.\n*   **Longevity:** Parental longevity.\n*   **Other:** Smoking cessation, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein measurement.\n\n#### Other Associated Entities:\n\n*   **Transcript (ID: 16368295):** Shares the same extensive list of GWAS associations as the BSN gene.\n*   **Non Coding RNA (ID: 17261937):** Associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin, coronary artery disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, reticulocyte count, and non-coding RNA measurement.\n*   **ChromHMM States (IDs: 19007925, 20167308, 20746107, 22589626):** These states are associated with various traits including blood protein measurement, BMI-adjusted waist circumference, BMI-adjusted waist-hip ratio, coronary artery disease, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, reticulocyte count, non-coding RNA measurement, glomerular filtration rate, creatinine measurement, HbA1c measurement, cystatin C measurement, C-reactive protein measurement, self-reported educational attainment, intelligence, cognitive function measurement, parental longevity, and body mass index.\n*   **chr_chain (ID: 175880):** Associated with mean corpuscular hemoglobin, coronary artery disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and Crohn's disease.\n\n### ClinVar Data Summary:\n\nA total of 6853 variants have been analyzed in ClinVar. Of these:\n*   128 are classified as Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic.\n*   1093 are classified as Benign/Likely Benign.\n*   5626 have Uncertain Significance.\n*   6 have Other Classifications.\n\n#### Associated Phenotypes/Diseases (from Non-Benign Variants):\n\nThe majority of non-benign variants within the analyzed entities are associated with **muscular dystrophy-related disorders**, specifically:\n\n*   **Autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2P** (most frequent association)\n*   **Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with brain and eye anomalies), type A9** (also highly frequent)\n*   **BSN-related disorder**\n*   **BSN related epilepsy**\n*   **Epilepsy**\n*   **Seizure**\n*   **Oromandibular-limb hypogenesis spectrum**\n*   **DAG1-related disorder**\n*   **Myopathy**\n*   **Elevated circulating creatine kinase concentration**\n*   **Qualitative or quantitative defects of alpha-dystroglycan**\n\nThese findings suggest a strong link between variants in the BSN gene and various forms of muscular dystrophies and neurological conditions.\n\n### Clues about Pathogenicity:\n\nThe variant rs138458970 itself is classified as **benign** and **likely benign** by ClinVar and ACMG criteria, respectively. Its population frequencies are also relatively low but present.\n\nHowever, the extensive GWAS associations with the BSN gene and its related entities highlight the gene's critical role in a wide range of physiological processes, including metabolism, inflammation, cognition, and development.\n\nCrucially, the ClinVar data reveals that **other variants within the BSN gene are strongly associated with severe genetic disorders, particularly muscular dystrophies and related neurological conditions.** This pattern of pathogenic variants in the same gene causing significant disease phenotypes is a critical piece of information.\n\n**Therefore, while this specific variant (rs138458970) is currently considered benign, the BSN gene is a known disease-associated gene. Any pathogenic variants in this gene can lead to significant health issues, primarily muscular dystrophies and epilepsy.** Further investigation into the functional impact of this specific variant, beyond its current classification, might be warranted if it resides in a critical regulatory region or has a predicted functional consequence not captured by standard annotations.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== BSN ===\nBSN Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: BSN**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 1117.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 604020.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Bassoon-related neurodevelopmental disorder, which can include epilepsy, developmental delay, behavioral phenotypes, and obesity. Other reported associations include epilepsy with a favorable outcome and a progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between BSN variants and epilepsy has been evaluated as \"strong\" based on the ClinGen framework.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Autosomal dominant inheritance, often arising de novo, is observed for protein-truncating variants. Autosomal recessive inheritance involving compound heterozygous variants has also been reported.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint scores for BSN (transcript NM_003458.3) are pLI = 1.00, pNull = 0, pRec = 0. The LOEUF is 0.08 (90% CI 0.04-0.15).\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A pLI score of \u22650.9 is considered extremely intolerant of loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The BSN pLI score of 1.00 and very low LOEUF score strongly indicate that the gene is haploinsufficient and does not tolerate the loss of one functional copy.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Protein-truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift) are a primary class of pathogenic variants, consistent with haploinsufficiency. Missense variants, both de novo and in compound heterozygous states, have also been reported as pathogenic.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n    *   Febrile seizure (HP:0002373).\n    *   Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).\n    *   Obesity (HP:0001513).\n    *   Behavioral disinhibition (p=3.39e-17 association).\n    *   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (HP:0007018).\n    *   Autistic behavior (HP:0000729).\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (HP:0002069).\n    *   Focal-onset seizure (HP:0007359).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Adult-onset severe obesity.\n    *   Type 2 diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978).\n    *   Hepatic steatosis (HP:0001397).\n    *   Progressive supranuclear ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000641).\n    *   Postural instability (HP:0002172).\n    *   Cognitive decline (HP:0100543).\n    *   Microcephaly (HP:0000252).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically in infancy or childhood for epilepsy and neurodevelopmental phenotypes. A distinct adult-onset phenotype including obesity and a neurodegenerative PSP-like syndrome has also been described.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype is broad, ranging from individuals with mild features or favorable-outcome epilepsy to those with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Adults may present with a milder neurodevelopmental phenotype or no obvious neurodevelopmental features.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** De novo protein-truncating variants (PTVs) are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by epilepsy, developmental delay, obesity, and behavioral issues. Biallelic missense variants have been linked to a more severe epileptic phenotype with neurodevelopmental delay.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Pathogenic missense variants causing epilepsy with a favorable outcome have been reported to cluster at the C-terminus of the Bassoon protein, suggesting a specific subregional effect.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Evidence suggests a moderate correlation, where the severity and type of phenotype can be linked to the variant type (e.g., monoallelic missense vs. biallelic missense vs. truncating variants).\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** Biallelic variants, including a deletion (p.Leu1454del) and a missense variant (p.Ala3642Val), were associated with frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delay, and microcephaly. Monoallelic missense variants were associated with benign epilepsy.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   This section requires a comprehensive table populated from ClinVar and literature, which is beyond the scope of a static summary. Representative examples are provided below based on available search results.\n*   **c.3322G>T (p.Glu1108Ter):** De novo nonsense variant; reported in a patient with infantile-onset epilepsy with febrile seizures but normal development.\n*   **c.7351C>T (p.Gln2451Ter):** De novo nonsense variant; reported in a patient with childhood-onset epilepsy, febrile seizures, and normal development.\n*   **p.Pro3520Leu & p.Thr3658Ser:** Two separate heterozygous missense variants; associated with epilepsy with a favorable outcome.\n*   **p.Leu1454del & p.Ala3642Val:** Compound heterozygous variants; associated with frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delay, and microcephalus.\n*   **MyGene2 Candidate 4093:** De novo variant of unknown type; listed as \"Suspected pathogenic\".\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** BSN is highly expressed in the brain, with highest expression levels in the cerebellum, cerebellar hemisphere, cortex, and caudate nucleus. This aligns with the provided existing data.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high and specific expression in multiple brain regions, including the cortex and hippocampus, is consistent with the observed neurological phenotypes such as epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and behavioral disorders.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** BSN expression is significantly higher during infancy and decreases in adolescence and adulthood, which may correlate with the typical infancy/childhood onset of epilepsy.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** BSN encodes Bassoon, a large scaffolding protein that organizes the presynaptic cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) to regulate synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Haploinsufficiency due to protein-truncating variants is a primary mechanism, leading to a loss of function. Some missense variants may also lead to loss of function, while others could have dominant-negative effects.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the presynaptic active zone impairs the integrity and function of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, leading to cortical hyperexcitability and seizures. In a separate mechanism, mutated BSN has been shown to lose its ability to reduce tau protein accumulation, potentially leading to tauopathy and neurodegeneration.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Bassoon functions in a complex with other CAZ proteins like Piccolo, Munc13, and RIMs. Its interaction with P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels is crucial for normal neurotransmitter release.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The exact diagnostic yield is not specified in the search results, but BSN is an emerging candidate gene found in epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorder cohorts via large-scale sequencing.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for BSN variants is indicated in individuals with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those with epilepsy (especially infantile or childhood-onset), developmental delay, and behavioral abnormalities.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** A genetic diagnosis can help predict the clinical course, with some genotypes suggesting a more favorable epilepsy outcome. Management is currently symptomatic, focusing on seizure control and supportive therapies for developmental delays.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the variable expressivity and wide phenotypic spectrum. Inheritance patterns can be autosomal dominant (often de novo) or recessive, impacting recurrence risk counseling for families.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 38896942 (2025):** Established that de novo disruptive BSN variants cause a synaptic disorder with a broad neurodevelopmental phenotype including epilepsy, developmental delay, obesity, and behavioral issues in a cohort of 29 individuals.\n*   **PMID: 32620603 (2020):** Identified BSN variants in eight families with epilepsy, suggesting a favorable outcome for many. It established the gene-disease relationship as \"strong\" and reported both de novo and recessive inheritance patterns, correlating phenotype severity with genotype.\n*   **PMID: 34168087 (2021):** Linked protein-truncating variants in BSN to severe adult-onset obesity, type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver disease, expanding the phenotype to include metabolic disorders.\n*   **PMID: 29335607 (2018):** Reported missense mutations in BSN in a family with a progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)-like syndrome, identifying a novel tauopathy and linking BSN to neurodegenerative disease through impaired reduction of tau accumulation.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   De novo protein-truncating variants are strongly associated with a phenotype that includes Seizures (HP:0001250), Global developmental delay (HP:0001263), and Obesity (HP:0001513).\n    *   Biallelic missense variants are associated with a more severe epilepsy phenotype and Microcephaly (HP:0000252).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of infantile/childhood-onset epilepsy (especially with febrile seizures), significant behavioral issues like disinhibition, and emerging obesity should raise strong suspicion for a pathogenic variant in BSN.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype overlaps with numerous other genetic causes of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Genes involved in presynaptic function and other forms of genetic epilepsy should be considered.\n\n***\n\n",

However, several factors suggest a potential role in pathogenicity:\n\n1.  **Association with Cognitive Function:** The presence of a GWAS association (GWAS_EFO_0008354) linking variants in the affected gene (UBR7) and its transcripts to **cognitive function measurement** is a significant clue. This suggests that alterations in this genetic region can impact cognitive abilities.\n2.  **ClinVar Phenotype Pattern:** The substantial number of non-benign variants in these entities associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders such as **Li-Campeau syndrome, Intellectual disability (mild and general), Galloway-Mowat syndrome, and Global developmental delay** strongly indicates a critical role for these genes in brain development and function.\n3.  **OMIM Status:** The \"OMIM: True\" annotation suggests that this genetic locus is linked to known human genetic disorders, further supporting its clinical relevance.\n4.  **High Proportion of Uncertain Significance Variants:** The overwhelming majority of variants in this locus within ClinVar are classified as \"uncertain significance\" (7181 out of 9622). This high number of variants with ambiguous clinical interpretation, coupled with the known disease associations, highlights the complexity of this region and the need for careful evaluation of individual variants.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the variant rs181764173 itself is classified as of uncertain significance, its location within genes and regulatory elements associated with cognitive function and a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders (including intellectual disability and various syndromes) warrants further investigation. The strong phenotypic pattern observed in ClinVar for other variants in this locus, combined with the GWAS association, suggests a potential for this variant to contribute to disease, particularly those affecting cognitive development.

This is consistent with its established autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants (e.g., nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site) are the expected pathogenic variant class.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms**:\n    *   Global developmental delay.\n    *   Intellectual disability.\n    *   Seizures / Epilepsy.\n    *   Ptosis.\n    *   Hypothyroidism.\n    *   Hypotonia.\n    *   Cryptorchidism.\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms**:\n    *   Genital anomalies (e.g., small penis).\n    *   Short stature.\n    *   Cardiac anomalies (variable, e.g., atrial septal defect).\n    *   Brain imaging anomalies (e.g., cortical atrophy).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: The age of onset appears to be in infancy or early childhood, with developmental delay noted early in life.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: The severity appears to be moderate to severe, involving significant neurodevelopmental and multi-systemic features.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants have been consistently associated with Li-Campeau syndrome.\n*   **Protein Domain-specific Phenotype Patterns**: Insufficient data exists to correlate variants in specific domains (e.g., UBR-box, PHD finger) with distinct phenotypes.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: The correlation between bi-allelic LoF variants and the core features of Li-Campeau syndrome is considered strong based on current evidence.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **ClinVar Pathogenic Variants**:\n    *   **c.556del (p.Ile186fs)**: Frameshift / Likely pathogenic for Li-Campeau syndrome / AF (gnomAD): 0.\n    *   **c.852+1G>A**: Splice donor / Pathogenic for Li-Campeau syndrome / AF (gnomAD): 0.\n    *   **c.109C>T (p.Arg37*)**: Nonsense / Pathogenic for Li-Campeau syndrome / AF (gnomAD): 0.\n    *   **c.346_349del (p.Ser116fs)**: Frameshift / Likely pathogenic for Li-Campeau syndrome / AF (gnomAD): 0.\n    *   **c.835C>T (p.Gln279*)**: Nonsense / Pathogenic for Li-Campeau syndrome / AF (gnomAD): 0.\n    *   **Note**: Somatic variants, such as c.292C>T (p.Arg98Cys), have been reported in conditions like malignant melanoma but are not associated with the germline syndrome.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues**: GTEx data shows widespread expression, with higher levels in the testis, skeletal muscle, and retina. Expression is also noted in the brain and thyroid.\n*   **Tissue-specific Phenotypes Expected**: High expression in the brain is consistent with the neurodevelopmental phenotype (intellectual disability, seizures). Expression in the testis aligns with the observed male genital anomalies. Thyroid expression may relate to hypothyroidism.\n*   **Expression During Development**: The gene is expressed starting early in embryonic development, consistent with its role in a congenital disorder.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: UBR7 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, a component of the N-end rule pathway that recognizes and targets proteins for degradation.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The mechanism for Li-Campeau syndrome is loss-of-function resulting from bi-allelic pathogenic variants, consistent with haploinsufficiency not being the primary mechanism.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**: Disruption of UBR7 function impairs the Notch signaling pathway, a critical pathway for development. UBR7 also functions as a histone H2B monoubiquitin ligase and an H3 chaperone, suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation contributes to the phenotype.\n*   **Protein-protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: UBR7 interacts with UBR5 in the Notch signaling pathway. It also interacts with histones and the histone chaperone NASP, linking it to chromatin regulation.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield**: The diagnostic yield of *UBR7* testing in specific cohorts is not yet established in the literature.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing**: Testing for *UBR7* is indicated for individuals presenting with a constellation of features including intellectual disability, seizures, ptosis, and hypothyroidism.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: Management is supportive and targeted at specific symptoms, such as anti-epileptic drugs for seizures and hormone replacement for hypothyroidism.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: As an autosomal recessive condition, parents of an affected individual are obligate carriers. The recurrence risk for future pregnancies is 25%.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Li, D. et al. (2021), *Am J Hum Genet*. PMID: 33340455**: This landmark paper first described the neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by bi-allelic *UBR7* variants in seven individuals, defining the core phenotype and linking the pathology to the Notch signaling pathway.\n*   **Adhikary, S. et al.

Additionally, it is linked to **Histone Modification Sites** and a **chr_chain** element.\n\n**GWAS Associations:**\n\n*   **GWAS_EFO_0004713 (FEV/FEC ratio):** This phenotype is associated with the MCM7 gene and its transcripts. The FEV/FEC ratio relates to lung function.\n*   **GWAS_EFO_0004703 (age at menarche):** This phenotype is associated with histone modification sites and a chr_chain element. Age at menarche is a significant developmental milestone.\n\n**ClinVar Associations:**\n\nThe ClinVar database contains a substantial number of variants (17372 analyzed) with diverse classifications. While the specific variant rs200061657 is classified as \"Uncertain significance,\" other variants within the analyzed entities show strong associations with several phenotypes and diseases, particularly those affecting the nervous system.\n\n**Key Phenotypes and Diseases from ClinVar (non-benign variants):**\n\n*   **Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia 50 (HSP50):** This is the most frequently reported phenotype, associated with a large number of variants (n=2407).\n*   **Inborn Genetic Diseases:** A broad category also frequently associated with variants (n=1465).\n*   **Spastic Paraplegia:** A related neurological disorder (n=237).\n*   **Intellectual Disability:** Often co-occurring with HSP50 (n=150).\n*   **Abnormality of the nervous system:** A general neurological phenotype (n=132).\n*   **AP4M1-related disorder:** A specific genetic disorder (n=131).\n*   **Meier-Gorlin syndrome:** A rare genetic disorder (n=60).\n*   **MCM7-related disorder:** A disorder directly linked to the MCM7 gene (n=41).\n*   **Autism spectrum disorder:** Also reported in association with some variants (n=21).\n*   **Prostate cancer:** A single association was noted (n=1).\n\n### Clues to Pathogenicity:\n\n1.  **Association with MCM7-related disorder:** The presence of \"MCM7-related disorder\" in ClinVar is a significant indicator that variants in or near the MCM7 gene can lead to disease.\n2.  **Strong association with neurological disorders:** The overwhelming association of variants within the analyzed entities with Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (various forms), Spastic Paraplegia, Intellectual Disability, and general nervous system abnormalities strongly suggests a role for these genetic regions in neurological function and development.\n3.  **GWAS association with lung function:** The link to FEV/FEC ratio via GWAS suggests a potential, though less direct, impact on respiratory health.\n4.  **GWAS association with age at menarche:** The association with age at menarche indicates a potential role in developmental timing.\n5.  **\"Uncertain Significance\" Classification:** While the specific variant is classified as \"Uncertain significance,\" the presence of numerous pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in the broader genetic region, coupled with the strong phenotypic associations, warrants further investigation. The low population frequency also supports the possibility of a disease-causing variant.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe variant chr7:100101280G>T (rs200061657) is located in the vicinity of the MCM7 gene and is associated with genetic entities that have strong links to **neurological disorders, particularly Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia and related conditions**. The presence of an \"MCM7-related disorder\" in ClinVar and the broad spectrum of neurological phenotypes associated with variants in this region are significant clues to potential pathogenicity. While the variant itself is classified as \"Uncertain significance,\" its low population frequency and the strong evidence from other variants in the associated genetic entities suggest that this variant could contribute to disease, especially neurological conditions. Further functional studies would be beneficial to definitively determine its pathogenicity.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== MCM7 ===\nMCM7 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n\u2013 **HGNC ID:** 6950\n\u2013 **OMIM Gene ID:** 600592\n\u2013 **Primary Disease Associations:**\n    - Autosomal Recessive Primary Microcephaly (MCPH) and Intellectual Disability\n    - Meier-Gorlin Syndrome\n    - A multi-system disorder with features including neonatal progeroid appearance, lipodystrophy, and adrenal insufficiency\n\u2013 **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for association with the above phenotypes is emerging, with case reports and functional studies supporting pathogenicity.\n\u2013 **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Autosomal recessive inheritance is documented for primary microcephaly and Meier-Gorlin syndrome-related phenotypes.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\u2013 **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    - The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score is a metric to assess a gene's tolerance to protein-truncating variants, with a value \u2265 0.9 indicating extreme intolerance.\n    - The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is a continuous metric of a gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variation.\n\u2013 **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The gnomAD database provides constraint scores like pLI and LOEUF that help in interpreting variant pathogenicity. Low LOEUF scores suggest a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variation.\n\u2013 **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Biallelic missense and likely loss-of-function variants have been reported as pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\u2013 **Primary HPO terms:**\n    - Microcephaly (HP:0000252)\n    - Severe intellectual disability (HP:0010864)\n    - Growth delay (HP:0001510)\n    - Speech impairment\n    - Motor impairment\n    - Behavioral abnormalities\n    - Adrenal insufficiency (HP:0000846)\n    - Lipodystrophy (HP:0009125)\n    - Progeroid appearance\n\u2013 **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    - Frontal bossing (HP:0002007)\n\u2013 **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes such as primary microcephaly are congenital. Other features like lipodystrophy and adrenal insufficiency can develop later in life.\n\u2013 **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with MCM7 variants can range from typical Meier-Gorlin syndrome to a more complex and severe multi-system disorder.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\u2013 **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous missense mutations have been linked to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly with intellectual disability. Biallelic variants, including missense mutations, are associated with a spectrum from Meier-Gorlin syndrome to a progeroid syndrome with lipodystrophy and adrenal insufficiency.\n\u2013 **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The MCM7 protein contains a highly conserved MCM domain essential for its function. A homozygous missense variant (p.Ala265Thr) located in a highly conserved region has been identified in patients with primary microcephaly and intellectual disability.\n\u2013 **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** There is an emerging correlation between biallelic MCM7 variants and developmental disorders. However, the observation of disparate clinical features in patients with similar variant profiles suggests a complex genotype-phenotype relationship that may be influenced by other factors.\n\u2013 **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    - A homozygous missense variant c.793G>A (p.Ala265T) in MCM7 was identified in three individuals with primary microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, and motor and speech impairments.\n    - A patient with typical Meier-Gorlin syndrome was found to have biallelic variants in MCM7.\n    - Another patient with a multi-system disorder including progeroid appearance, lipodystrophy, and adrenal insufficiency also had biallelic MCM7 variants.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.793G>A (p.Ala265T)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Primary microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, speech and motor impairments\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.1579C>T (p.Arg527Ter)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.776G>C (p.Gly259Ala)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.1616A>G (p.Tyr539Cys)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.415C>T (p.Gln139Ter)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\u2013 **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** MCM7 is highly expressed in proliferating cells. Studies in mice show high expression of Mcm7 in the proliferative zones of the brain during early development, consistent with its role in neurogenesis. This aligns with the neurological phenotypes, such as microcephaly, observed in patients.\n\u2013 **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its crucial role in DNA replication, pathogenic variants in MCM7 are expected to affect rapidly dividing tissues, leading to developmental defects like microcephaly and growth retardation.\n\u2013 **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Mcm7 expression is higher during early mouse developmental stages. This is consistent with congenital phenotypes like primary microcephaly.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\u2013 **Normal Gene Function in One Sentence:** MCM7 is a core component of the MCM2-7 complex, which functions as the replicative helicase essential for initiating and elongating DNA replication once per cell cycle.\n\u2013 **Disease Mechanism:** Pathogenic variants in MCM7 can lead to a dysfunctional protein, impairing the formation and function of the MCM complex. This results in reduced efficiency of S-phase progression and can lead to genomic instability. The mechanism is generally considered loss-of-function.\n\u2013 **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the MCM2-7 complex function impairs DNA replication, which is fundamental for cell proliferation. Inaccurate DNA replication can lead to a decrease in proliferating cells, particularly in critical developmental processes like neurogenesis, resulting in brain malformations such as microcephaly. The MCM complex is a key part of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC).\n\u2013 **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** MCM7 interacts with other MCM proteins (MCM2-6) to form the hexameric MCM complex. Variants can disrupt these interactions, affecting the stability and function of the entire complex.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\u2013 **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Whole-exome sequencing has been successful in identifying biallelic MCM7 variants in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and features of Meier-Gorlin syndrome.\n\u2013 **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for MCM7 variants should be considered in patients presenting with primary microcephaly, intellectual disability, and/or features of Meier-Gorlin syndrome, especially when other known causes have been excluded.\n\u2013 **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, management is supportive and tailored to the patient's specific symptoms. A definitive molecular diagnosis can guide genetic counseling.\n\u2013 **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For autosomal recessive conditions, parents of an affected child are obligate carriers. There is a 25% chance of having another affected child with each pregnancy.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\u2013 **PMID: 34059554, 2022:** Reported a homozygous missense mutation in MCM7 causing autosomal recessive primary microcephaly and intellectual disability, highlighting the crucial role of MCM7 in nervous system development.\n\u2013 **PMID: 33654309, 2021:** Described biallelic MCM7 variants in patients with a phenotypic spectrum from Meier-Gorlin syndrome to a multi-system disorder with lipodystrophy and adrenal insufficiency, expanding the clinical genetics of disrupted DNA replication.\n\u2013 **New Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Discovered:** Recent studies have established a link between biallelic MCM7 mutations and a spectrum of human developmental disorders, including primary microcephaly and Meier-Gorlin syndrome-related phenotypes.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\u2013 **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    - Homozygous missense variants (e.g., p.Ala265T) are strongly associated with a phenotype of primary microcephaly (HP:0000252) and severe intellectual disability (HP:0010864).\n    - Biallelic variants, including truncating and missense changes, are associated with growth delay (HP:0001510) and features of Meier-Gorlin syndrome.\n\u2013 **Phenotype red flags:**\n    - The combination of congenital microcephaly (HP:0000252), severe intellectual disability (HP:0010864), and growth retardation (HP:0001510) in the absence of other major malformations is highly suggestive of an MCM7-related disorder.\n\u2013 **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**\n    - The phenotype of MCM7 mutations overlaps with other disorders caused by variants in genes involved in DNA replication and repair. This includes other forms of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) and Meier-Gorlin syndrome caused by mutations in genes like ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6.\n\n",

BSN Gene and Transcript:**\n\n*   **GWAS Associations:** Variants within the BSN gene and its transcript have been associated with a wide array of phenotypes and diseases. These include:\n    *   **Metabolic and Inflammatory Markers:** C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement, cystatin C measurement, HbA1c measurement, creatinine measurement, glomerular filtration rate, glucose measurement, blood protein measurement, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume.\n    *   **Cognitive and Educational Traits:** Self-reported educational attainment, intelligence, cognitive function measurement, mathematical ability.\n    *   **Reproductive and Developmental Traits:** Age at menarche.\n    *   **Socioeconomic Factors:** Household income.\n    *   **Hematological Parameters:** Reticulocyte count, reticulocyte measurement, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume.\n    *   **Inflammatory and Autoimmune Conditions:** Ulcerative colitis, sclerosing cholangitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease.\n    *   **Cardiovascular Health:** Coronary artery disease, BMI-adjusted waist-hip ratio, BMI-adjusted waist circumference, body mass index.\n    *   **Other:** Prostate carcinoma, susceptibility to childhood ear infection, parental longevity, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein measurement, chronotype measurement, smoking cessation.\n\n*   **ClinVar Data:**\n    *   A significant number of variants (3879 analyzed) in the BSN gene have been submitted to ClinVar.\n    *   While the majority of variants have uncertain significance (2903), there are a notable number classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic (125).\n    *   **Associated Diseases/Phenotypes (from non-benign variants):** The most frequently reported conditions associated with pathogenic variants in BSN include:\n        *   **Muscular Dystrophies:** Autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2P, Muscular dystrophy-dystroglycanopathy (congenital with brain and eye anomalies), types A9 and A1.\n        *   **Neurological Disorders:** BSN-related disorder, BSN related epilepsy, Epilepsy, Seizure.\n        *   **Other Genetic Disorders:** Inborn genetic diseases, DAG1-related disorder, Oromandibular-limb hypogenesis spectrum.\n        *   **Other Phenotypes:** Elevated circulating creatine kinase concentration, Myopathy, Qualitative or quantitative defects of alpha-dystroglycan.\n\n**2. ChromHMM States and chr_chain:**\n\n*   **GWAS Associations:** Variants within these regulatory regions are associated with:\n    *   Body mass index (BMI)\n    *   Self-reported educational attainment\n    *   Intelligence\n    *   Parental longevity\n    *   BMI-adjusted waist circumference and waist-hip ratio.\n\n### Clues about Pathogenicity:\n\n*   **Variant Classification:** The variant rs148125466 itself is classified as **benign/likely benign** by ClinVar and **Likely benign** by ACMG. This is a strong indicator that this specific variant is unlikely to be pathogenic.\n*   **Population Frequency:** The observed allele frequencies in gnomAD and 1KG are relatively low, which is consistent with a rare or benign variant.\n*   **BSN Gene Function:** The BSN gene is known to be involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and neuronal development. Pathogenic variants in BSN are strongly associated with severe neurological and muscular disorders, including various forms of muscular dystrophy and epilepsy.\n*   **GWAS and ClinVar Pattern:** While the BSN gene is implicated in a broad spectrum of traits and diseases through GWAS, the **ClinVar data reveals a clear pattern of severe Mendelian disorders** (muscular dystrophies, epilepsy) associated with pathogenic variants. The presence of numerous pathogenic variants in ClinVar for BSN, linked to these specific severe conditions, highlights the gene's critical role in these pathways.\n*   **Contradiction:** The benign classification of the specific variant rs148125466 contrasts with the known severe phenotypes associated with other variants in the BSN gene. This suggests that while BSN is a gene of interest for pathogenic variants, this particular variant does not appear to disrupt its function in a disease-causing manner.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nBased on the available data, the variant chr3:49642697G>A (rs148125466) is classified as **likely benign**. While the BSN gene is a significant locus for severe genetic disorders, particularly muscular dystrophies and epilepsy, this specific variant does not carry the hallmarks of pathogenicity according to current annotations and population frequencies. The extensive GWAS associations with various traits indicate BSN's broad involvement in human biology, but the ClinVar data points to specific severe phenotypes when pathogenic variants occur.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== BSN ===\nBSN Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: BSN**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 1117.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 604020.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Bassoon-related neurodevelopmental disorder, which can include epilepsy, developmental delay, behavioral phenotypes, and obesity. Other reported associations include epilepsy with a favorable outcome and a progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between BSN variants and epilepsy has been evaluated as \"strong\" based on the ClinGen framework.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Autosomal dominant inheritance, often arising de novo, is observed for protein-truncating variants. Autosomal recessive inheritance involving compound heterozygous variants has also been reported.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint scores for BSN (transcript NM_003458.3) are pLI = 1.00, pNull = 0, pRec = 0. The LOEUF is 0.08 (90% CI 0.04-0.15).\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A pLI score of \u22650.9 is considered extremely intolerant of loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The BSN pLI score of 1.00 and very low LOEUF score strongly indicate that the gene is haploinsufficient and does not tolerate the loss of one functional copy.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Protein-truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift) are a primary class of pathogenic variants, consistent with haploinsufficiency. Missense variants, both de novo and in compound heterozygous states, have also been reported as pathogenic.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n    *   Febrile seizure (HP:0002373).\n    *   Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).\n    *   Obesity (HP:0001513).\n    *   Behavioral disinhibition (p=3.39e-17 association).\n    *   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (HP:0007018).\n    *   Autistic behavior (HP:0000729).\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (HP:0002069).\n    *   Focal-onset seizure (HP:0007359).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Adult-onset severe obesity.\n    *   Type 2 diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978).\n    *   Hepatic steatosis (HP:0001397).\n    *   Progressive supranuclear ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000641).\n    *   Postural instability (HP:0002172).\n    *   Cognitive decline (HP:0100543).\n    *   Microcephaly (HP:0000252).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically in infancy or childhood for epilepsy and neurodevelopmental phenotypes. A distinct adult-onset phenotype including obesity and a neurodegenerative PSP-like syndrome has also been described.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype is broad, ranging from individuals with mild features or favorable-outcome epilepsy to those with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Adults may present with a milder neurodevelopmental phenotype or no obvious neurodevelopmental features.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** De novo protein-truncating variants (PTVs) are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by epilepsy, developmental delay, obesity, and behavioral issues. Biallelic missense variants have been linked to a more severe epileptic phenotype with neurodevelopmental delay.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Pathogenic missense variants causing epilepsy with a favorable outcome have been reported to cluster at the C-terminus of the Bassoon protein, suggesting a specific subregional effect.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Evidence suggests a moderate correlation, where the severity and type of phenotype can be linked to the variant type (e.g., monoallelic missense vs. biallelic missense vs. truncating variants).\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** Biallelic variants, including a deletion (p.Leu1454del) and a missense variant (p.Ala3642Val), were associated with frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delay, and microcephaly. Monoallelic missense variants were associated with benign epilepsy.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   This section requires a comprehensive table populated from ClinVar and literature, which is beyond the scope of a static summary. Representative examples are provided below based on available search results.\n*   **c.3322G>T (p.Glu1108Ter):** De novo nonsense variant; reported in a patient with infantile-onset epilepsy with febrile seizures but normal development.\n*   **c.7351C>T (p.Gln2451Ter):** De novo nonsense variant; reported in a patient with childhood-onset epilepsy, febrile seizures, and normal development.\n*   **p.Pro3520Leu & p.Thr3658Ser:** Two separate heterozygous missense variants; associated with epilepsy with a favorable outcome.\n*   **p.Leu1454del & p.Ala3642Val:** Compound heterozygous variants; associated with frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delay, and microcephalus.\n*   **MyGene2 Candidate 4093:** De novo variant of unknown type; listed as \"Suspected pathogenic\".\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** BSN is highly expressed in the brain, with highest expression levels in the cerebellum, cerebellar hemisphere, cortex, and caudate nucleus. This aligns with the provided existing data.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high and specific expression in multiple brain regions, including the cortex and hippocampus, is consistent with the observed neurological phenotypes such as epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and behavioral disorders.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** BSN expression is significantly higher during infancy and decreases in adolescence and adulthood, which may correlate with the typical infancy/childhood onset of epilepsy.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** BSN encodes Bassoon, a large scaffolding protein that organizes the presynaptic cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) to regulate synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Haploinsufficiency due to protein-truncating variants is a primary mechanism, leading to a loss of function. Some missense variants may also lead to loss of function, while others could have dominant-negative effects.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the presynaptic active zone impairs the integrity and function of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, leading to cortical hyperexcitability and seizures. In a separate mechanism, mutated BSN has been shown to lose its ability to reduce tau protein accumulation, potentially leading to tauopathy and neurodegeneration.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Bassoon functions in a complex with other CAZ proteins like Piccolo, Munc13, and RIMs. Its interaction with P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels is crucial for normal neurotransmitter release.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The exact diagnostic yield is not specified in the search results, but BSN is an emerging candidate gene found in epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorder cohorts via large-scale sequencing.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for BSN variants is indicated in individuals with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those with epilepsy (especially infantile or childhood-onset), developmental delay, and behavioral abnormalities.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** A genetic diagnosis can help predict the clinical course, with some genotypes suggesting a more favorable epilepsy outcome. Management is currently symptomatic, focusing on seizure control and supportive therapies for developmental delays.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the variable expressivity and wide phenotypic spectrum. Inheritance patterns can be autosomal dominant (often de novo) or recessive, impacting recurrence risk counseling for families.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 38896942 (2025):** Established that de novo disruptive BSN variants cause a synaptic disorder with a broad neurodevelopmental phenotype including epilepsy, developmental delay, obesity, and behavioral issues in a cohort of 29 individuals.\n*   **PMID: 32620603 (2020):** Identified BSN variants in eight families with epilepsy, suggesting a favorable outcome for many. It established the gene-disease relationship as \"strong\" and reported both de novo and recessive inheritance patterns, correlating phenotype severity with genotype.\n*   **PMID: 34168087 (2021):** Linked protein-truncating variants in BSN to severe adult-onset obesity, type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver disease, expanding the phenotype to include metabolic disorders.\n*   **PMID: 29335607 (2018):** Reported missense mutations in BSN in a family with a progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)-like syndrome, identifying a novel tauopathy and linking BSN to neurodegenerative disease through impaired reduction of tau accumulation.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   De novo protein-truncating variants are strongly associated with a phenotype that includes Seizures (HP:0001250), Global developmental delay (HP:0001263), and Obesity (HP:0001513).\n    *   Biallelic missense variants are associated with a more severe epilepsy phenotype and Microcephaly (HP:0000252).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of infantile/childhood-onset epilepsy (especially with febrile seizures), significant behavioral issues like disinhibition, and emerging obesity should raise strong suspicion for a pathogenic variant in BSN.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype overlaps with numerous other genetic causes of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Genes involved in presynaptic function and other forms of genetic epilepsy should be considered.\n\n***\n\n",
