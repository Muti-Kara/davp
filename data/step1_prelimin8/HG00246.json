                "description": "ARL17B Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID**: 32387.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID**: There is currently no OMIM entry for ARL17B.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations**: While not linked to a Mendelian disease, ARL17B is associated with risk for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Parkinson's disease. It is also implicated in Koolen-De Vries Syndrome and Glass Syndrome due to its location within the 17q21.31 chromosomal region, which is associated with these syndromes. Additionally, copy number variations in this region that include ARL17B have been identified in cases of developmental dyslexia.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The evidence for ARL17B's role in disease is currently associative and not definitive for a monogenic disorder.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients**: Not applicable for a monogenic disease, but its association with neurodegenerative diseases is linked to risk alleles.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI of 0.00, a LOEUF of 1.18, pRec of 0.58, and pNull of 0.42.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The very low pLI score (closer to 0) and a LOEUF score greater than 1 suggest that ARL17B is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This means that variants that would normally truncate the protein are observed in the general population at a frequency that is not significantly lower than expected, indicating the gene is likely not essential for survival or critical functions in a heterozygous state.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be gain-of-function or have a dominant-negative effect. However, no definitive pathogenic variants have been established.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\nAs ARL17B is not definitively linked to a monogenic disorder, a comprehensive list of HPO terms is not available. Associations are primarily with complex neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n*   **Primary HPO terms**: No specific HPO terms are directly attributed to ARL17B variants in databases like ClinVar or OMIM.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**: Not applicable.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: The associated neurodegenerative diseases, like Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Parkinson's disease, are typically adult-onset.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Not applicable.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: Studies have associated certain SNPs (rs8070723 and rs242557) with altered ARL17B expression levels in the brain, which in turn are associated with risk for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. Specifically, the protective rs8070723-G allele is linked to lower brain levels of ARL17B, while the risk-associated rs242557-A allele is also linked to lower brain levels.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: No specific domain-phenotype correlations have been established.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: The correlation is currently considered associative for complex diseases.\n*   **Examples**:\n    *   rs8070723-G allele (protective for PSP) \u2192 Lower ARL17B brain expression levels.\n    *   rs242557-A allele (risk for PSP) \u2192 Lower ARL17B brain levels.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No definitively pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for ARL17B are listed in ClinVar. The database primarily contains variants of uncertain significance or those associated with complex traits.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation**: ARL17B shows expression in various tissues, with nervous system tissues being particularly relevant due to the association with neurodegenerative diseases. Expression in the temporal cortex has been specifically studied in relation to PSP.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Altered expression in brain tissues is linked to the pathophysiology of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: Its potential involvement in developmental dyslexia suggests a role in neurodevelopmental processes. The link to adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases suggests its function is also important in the aging brain.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: ARL17B is a GTP-binding protein predicted to be involved in intracellular protein transport and vesicle-mediated transport within the Golgi apparatus.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The disease mechanism is likely not due to simple haploinsufficiency, given the gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variants. Altered regulation of gene expression, potentially influenced by risk-associated SNPs and methylation changes, appears to contribute to disease risk for conditions like PSP.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: As a GTPase involved in trafficking, altered ARL17B function could disrupt protein transport and vesicle dynamics in neurons, potentially contributing to the tau pathology seen in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: As a member of the ARF GTPase family, it likely interacts with other proteins involved in vesicle budding and transport, but specific interactions linked to phenotype are not yet defined.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: Testing for ARL17B is not standard practice for diagnosing any monogenic disorder.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: ARL17B is typically analyzed in research settings investigating the genetic basis of neurodegenerative diseases like PSP and Parkinson's, or in studies of the 17q21.31 chromosomal region.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: There is currently no clinical actionability based on ARL17B genotype.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling would focus on the complex, multifactorial nature of the associated neurodegenerative diseases, where ARL17B variants are considered risk factors rather than causative mutations.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 27500532, Year: 2016**: This study established a link between PSP risk SNPs and the expression of ARL17B in the brain, suggesting it as a candidate risk gene. It also correlated these genetic variants with CpG methylation levels and the severity of tau neuropathology.\n*   **Key Phenotype Findings**: The study found that PSP risk alleles at the MAPT locus were associated with altered ARL17B expression and higher levels of neuropathology (coiled bodies and tufted astrocytes).\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: There are currently no high-confidence associations between specific ARL17B variants and HPO terms for monogenic disease.\n*   **Phenotype red flags**: There are no specific \"red flag\" phenotypes that strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in ARL17B itself. However, phenotypes associated with the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome (e.g., Koolen-De Vries Syndrome) might prompt investigation of this chromosomal region, which includes ARL17B.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**: For patients with neurodegenerative symptoms, particularly those overlapping with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy or Parkinson's disease, other genes with more established roles in these conditions should be considered first. For developmental phenotypes, genes within the broader 17q21.31 region, such as KANSL1, are the primary drivers of the associated syndromes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in ARL17B (1/1):\nN/A.

                "description": "HFE Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **HFE Gene Dossier**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HFE\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 613609\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Hemochromatosis Type 1 (HFE1) [MIM:235200], Porphyria Variegata [MIM:176200], Microvascular Complications of Diabetes 7 [MIM:612635].\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between HFE variants and hereditary hemochromatosis is considered definitive.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Primarily autosomal recessive with low clinical penetrance. Pseudodominance has been observed due to the high carrier frequency of p.Cys282Tyr in European populations.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v4 constraint metrics for HFE are pLI = 1.39e-11, LOEUF = 1.05, pRec = 0, and pNull = 1.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A high pLI score (typically \u2265 0.9) suggests a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The very low pLI and high LOEUF for HFE indicate that it is not constrained against LoF variants, which aligns with the recessive nature of the disease where heterozygotes are generally unaffected.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Missense variants are the most common cause of HFE-related hemochromatosis. Nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants have also been reported.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Elevated serum ferritin (HP:0003281)\n    *   Increased transferrin saturation (HP:0003155)\n    *   Hepatocellular carcinoma (HP:0001402)\n    *   Cirrhosis (HP:0001394)\n    *   Arthropathy (HP:0001369)\n    *   Hepatomegaly (HP:0002240)\n    *   Diabetes mellitus (HP:0000819)\n    *   Cardiomyopathy (HP:0001638)\n    *   Skin hyperpigmentation (HP:0000953)\n    *   Fatigue/Lethargy (HP:0012378, HP:0001947)\n    *   Abdominal pain (HP:0002027)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HP:0000044)\n    *   Alopecia (HP:0001596)\n    *   Hepatic steatosis (HP:0001397)\n    *   Fragile skin (HP:0001030)\n    *   Polycythemia vera (HP:0001897)\n    *   Intellectual disability (Rare) (HP:0001249)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Clinical manifestations typically appear between 40 and 60 years of age in males and after menopause in females. Juvenile onset is rare and usually associated with other hemochromatosis genes.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotypic spectrum is highly variable, ranging from non-penetrant (no clinical or biochemical signs), to biochemical (elevated iron markers without end-organ damage), to clinical HFE hemochromatosis with significant end-organ damage.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygosity for the p.Cys282Tyr missense variant is the most common genotype and is associated with the classic adult-onset hemochromatosis phenotype. Compound heterozygosity for p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp can lead to a milder phenotype with elevated iron levels, but often without overt clinical disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The p.Cys282Y mutation is located in the \u03b13 domain of the HFE protein and disrupts its interaction with beta-2 microglobulin, preventing its transport to the cell surface. The p.His63Asp variant is located in the \u03b11 domain and may have a lesser effect on protein function.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is strong for the p.Cys282Y homozygous genotype leading to biochemical iron overload, but the clinical penetrance is low and variable. Other genetic and environmental factors modify the phenotype.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   p.Cys282Tyr homozygosity is strongly associated with increased serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, with a subset of individuals developing cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and diabetes.\n    *   p.Cys282Tyr/p.His63Asp compound heterozygosity is associated with a lower risk of hemochromatosis-related morbidity compared to p.Cys282Y homozygotes.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **rs1800562 / c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) / Pathogenic (low penetrance):** Associated with Hemochromatosis Type 1, characterized by elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, with potential for liver disease, diabetes, and arthropathy. AF (gnomAD): ~3.7%\n*   **rs1799945 / c.187C>G (p.His63Asp) / VUS/Likely Benign:** When compounded with p.Cys282Y, may lead to mild hyperferritinemia. AF (gnomAD): ~8.6%.\n*   **rs146519482 / c.502G>T (p.Glu168Ter) / Pathogenic:** Causes loss of function and can lead to hemochromatosis, especially when compounded with p.Cys282Y. AF (gnomAD): Rare.\n*   **rs759524388 / c.211C>T (p.Arg71Ter) / Pathogenic:** A rare nonsense mutation associated with hemochromatosis. AF (gnomAD): Very rare.\n*   **rs573745685 / c.1006+1G>A / Pathogenic:** A splice site variant leading to loss of function and hemochromatosis. AF (gnomAD): Very rare.\n*   **rs765804978 / c.546_547del (p.Leu183fs) / Pathogenic:** A frameshift variant causing a truncated, non-functional protein. AF (gnomAD): Very rare.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** HFE is highly expressed in the liver and small intestine. This is consistent with its role in regulating iron absorption in the gut and iron storage in the liver.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Liver dysfunction, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, is a primary phenotype due to iron accumulation. Pancreatic iron deposition can lead to diabetes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The age-related onset of symptoms is due to the progressive accumulation of iron over decades.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The HFE protein interacts with the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to regulate the uptake of iron into cells and is crucial for the normal regulation of hepcidin, the main hormone controlling iron metabolism.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is loss-of-function due to mutations that impair the HFE protein's ability to reach the cell surface or bind to its partners. This leads to reduced hepcidin expression, causing increased intestinal iron absorption and iron overload in various organs.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the HFE-TfR1 interaction and subsequent low hepcidin levels lead to increased activity of the iron exporter ferroportin on enterocytes and macrophages. This results in excessive iron loading in the plasma and deposition in tissues like the liver, heart, and pancreas, causing oxidative damage and organ dysfunction.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction of HFE with beta-2 microglobulin is essential for its proper cell surface localization. The interaction with TfR1 is key to its iron-sensing function, and it is thought to modulate the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway to regulate hepcidin.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In individuals of Northern European descent with clinical signs of hemochromatosis, homozygosity for the p.Cys282Y mutation is found in about 80-90% of cases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Testing for HFE mutations is typically performed in individuals with elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, or with a family history of hemochromatosis.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Early diagnosis and treatment with therapeutic phlebotomy to remove excess iron can prevent organ damage and lead to a normal life expectancy.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, the low and variable clinical penetrance of the p.Cys282Y homozygous genotype, and the lower risk associated with other genotypes like compound heterozygosity. Family screening can identify at-risk relatives.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Feder JN, et al. (1996) Nat Genet. PMID: 8673096:** Landmark paper identifying the HFE gene as the cause of hereditary hemochromatosis.\n*   **Beutler E, et al. (2002) Lancet. PMID: 11812557:** A large population study demonstrating the low penetrance of HFE C282Y homozygosity.\n*   **Allen KJ, et al. (2008) N Engl J Med. PMID: 18184960:** A prospective study detailing the natural history and disease risk in HFE C282Y homozygotes, highlighting that severe iron-overload-related disease is relatively uncommon.\n*   **Ganz T. (2011) Blood. PMID: 21633120:** A review detailing the role of hepcidin in iron homeostasis and how its dysregulation in HFE hemochromatosis leads to disease.\n*   **Barton JC, et al. (2015) Gene.

Abstract 1088:** A large cohort study associating HFE p.Cys282Y homozygosity with phenotypes beyond iron overload, including polycythemia vera and lower cholesterol levels.\n*   **Powell LW, et al. (2024) Genet Med. PMID: 40034140:** A study using the All of Us research program data suggesting potential underdiagnosis and undertesting of HFE-related hemochromatosis in clinical practice.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Homozygosity for the p.Cys282Y variant (rs1800562) is strongly associated with elevated serum ferritin (HP:0003281) and increased transferrin saturation (HP:0003155).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of elevated serum ferritin, increased transferrin saturation, and clinical features like arthropathy (especially of the metacarpophalangeal joints), liver disease, or skin hyperpigmentation strongly suggests pathogenic variants in the HFE gene.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Phenotypes of iron overload can also be caused by mutations in other genes, leading to different types of hemochromatosis such as HFE2 (Juvenile Hemochromatosis, due to HJV or HAMP mutations), HFE3 (TFR2 mutations), and HFE4 (SLC40A1 mutations), which should be considered in HFE-negative cases.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in HFE (1/1):\nN/A.

                "description": "SPTBN4 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: SPTBN4**\n\nThis dossier provides a comprehensive clinical genetics summary for the SPTBN4 gene, focusing on genotype-phenotype correlations to aid in the assessment of genetic variants.\n\n***\n\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 14896.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 606214.\n*   **Primary Disease Association:** Biallelic pathogenic variants in SPTBN4 are associated with Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, neuropathy, and deafness (NEDHND), also referred to as SPTBN4-related disorder (OMIM #617519).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between SPTBN4 and NEDHND is considered definitive, based on multiple reports of pathogenic variants in affected individuals.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, requiring homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants. Parents are typically heterozygous carriers.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score helps to quantify a gene's intolerance to protein-truncating variants, with a score \u2265 0.9 indicating high intolerance. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is a continuous metric where lower values indicate greater intolerance to loss-of-function variation. Specific gnomAD constraint values for SPTBN4 were not available in the searched literature.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Genes with high pLI scores and low LOEUF scores are under strong negative selection against loss-of-function variants. For recessive diseases like NEDHND, constraint scores in heterozygotes (as represented in gnomAD) may not fully reflect the gene's essentiality when function is completely lost.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Loss-of-function variants, including nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site variants, are the most common pathogenic variant types. Multi-exon deletions and missense variants have also been reported as pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Congenital muscular hypotonia (HP:0008944).\n    *   Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).\n    *   Areflexia (HP:0001284).\n    *   Motor developmental delay (HP:0001270).\n    *   Absent speech (HP:0001344).\n    *   Intellectual disability, severe to profound (HP:0010864, HP:0002187).\n    *   Peripheral axonal neuropathy (HP:0003477).\n    *   Hearing impairment / Auditory neuropathy (HP:0000365, HP:0030043).\n    *   Feeding difficulties / Dysphagia (HP:0011968, HP:0002015).\n    *   Muscular atrophy (HP:0003202).\n    *   Respiratory insufficiency (HP:0002093).\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Horizontal nystagmus (HP:0000666).\n    *   Choreoathetosis (HP:0001266).\n    *   Cortical visual impairment (HP:0100704).\n    *   Joint contractures (HP:0001371).\n    *   Thin corpus callosum (HP:0002079).\n    *   Facial weakness / Myopathic facies (HP:0000324, HP:0002058).\n    *   Esotropia (HP:0000565).\n    *   Microphthalmia (HP:0000568).\n    *   High-arched palate (HP:0000218).\n    *   Broad nasal bridge (HP:0000431).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically congenital, with hypotonia and feeding difficulties often present at birth.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype is typically severe, with most individuals having profound developmental delay and lack of independent motor skills. However, a milder phenotype with preserved cognitive development has been reported in one family, indicating some variability.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Biallelic loss-of-function variants consistently lead to the core features of NEDHND.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No clear correlations between the location of the variant within the protein and specific phenotypic outcomes have been consistently established.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Currently considered weak or not well-established. One report described siblings with a homozygous splice-site variant who presented with axonal neuropathy but without intellectual disability, suggesting that some variants may lead to a less severe neurocognitive phenotype.\n*   **Examples:** A homozygous splice-site variant was associated with axonal neuropathy in the absence of intellectual disability in two siblings.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1090C>T (p.Gln364*):** Homozygous nonsense; Likely Pathogenic; Core NEDHND phenotype without hearing loss or epilepsy, but with dysmorphic features.\n*   **c.1799_1800delGC (p.Ala600Profs*90):** Homozygous frameshift; Pathogenic; Severe muscular hypotonia, dysphagia, absent speech, global developmental delay, and intellectual disability.\n*   **c.3375_3393del (p.Asp1126Thrfs*39):** Homozygous frameshift; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features including severe muscular hypotonia, dysphagia, and absent speech.\n*   **c.1247del (p.Leu417Tyrfs*5):** Homozygous frameshift; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **c.737G>C (p.Trp246Ser):** Compound heterozygous with a multi-exon deletion; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **c.1149dup (p.Asn384Glnfs*17):** Compound heterozygous; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **Multi-exon deletion (exons 6-11):** Compound heterozygous with a missense variant; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **c.1597C>T (p.Arg533*):** Homozygous nonsense; Pathogenic; First described case with congenital myopathy, deafness, and neuropathy.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues and Clinical Correlation:** SPTBN4 shows high expression in various brain regions, including the cerebellum, cortex, and thalamus, as well as in the retina and spinal cord. This expression pattern is highly consistent with the observed neurological phenotypes, including developmental delay, neuropathy, and visual impairment.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The prominent expression in the central and peripheral nervous system directly relates to the core phenotypes of neuropathy, intellectual disability, and hearing loss. The role in muscle is debated, with some evidence suggesting myopathy is a primary feature while other studies indicate it is secondary to denervation.\n*   **Expression During Development:** The gene's function is critical during neurodevelopment, as evidenced by the congenital onset of symptoms.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** SPTBN4 encodes \u03b2IV-spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein that links the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton and is crucial for organizing membrane domains in neurons.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is loss-of-function. Biallelic pathogenic variants disrupt the \u03b2IV-spectrin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the proper clustering and localization of voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels at the axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of ion channel clustering impairs the initiation and propagation of action potentials, leading to axonal neuropathy. The disruption of cytoskeletal integrity likely contributes to the broader neurodevelopmental defects, hypotonia, and auditory dysfunction.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** \u03b2IV-spectrin interacts with ankyrin-G to anchor ion channels in the neuronal membrane; disruption of this interaction is a key pathological event.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The exact diagnostic yield is unknown, but SPTBN4 variants are a rare cause of congenital hypotonia and neurodevelopmental disorders. Because the phenotype overlaps with many other neuromuscular disorders, a broad genetic testing approach, such as a multi-gene panel or exome sequencing, is recommended over single-gene testing.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for SPTBN4 is indicated in individuals presenting with congenital hypotonia, areflexia, global developmental delay, and sensorineural hearing loss, particularly after more common causes like spinal muscular atrophy have been excluded.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Management is supportive and symptomatic. This includes physical and occupational therapy, nutritional support via feeding tubes, respiratory support (e.g., BiPAP), standard anti-seizure medications, and hearing aids or other support for auditory neuropathy.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling is critical for affected families. As an autosomal recessive disorder, siblings of an affected individual have a 25% chance of being affected. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and options for prenatal or preimplantation genetic testing should be discussed.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Knierim et al., 2017 (PMID: 28540413):** First report describing a homozygous nonsense mutation in SPTBN4 causing a syndrome of congenital myopathy, deafness, and neuropathy.\n*   **Wang et al., 2018 (PMID: 29861105):** Described additional patients and demonstrated that loss-of-function variants disrupt sodium channel clustering, establishing neuropathy as a key feature.\n*   **GeneReviews, 2020:** Provided a comprehensive clinical overview of SPTBN4 disorder, summarizing the phenotype, diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling considerations.\n*   **Buelow et al., 2021 (PMID: 33772159):** Expanded the genetic and phenotypic spectrum with five new patients from four families, reporting novel variants and highlighting clinical similarities to non-5q SMA and congenital myopathies.\n*   **Gunay et al., 2023 (DOI: 10.54029/2023unk):** Reported a new homozygous nonsense variant and expanded the phenotype to include previously unreported dysmorphic features, reinforcing the core clinical features.\n*   **Al-Sagr et al., 2024 (Rare):** Described a novel homozygous frameshift variant in three siblings, helping to establish the core symptoms associated with SPTBN4 mutations.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Biallelic loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, and large deletions) are strongly associated with the NEDHND phenotype, characterized by congenital muscular hypotonia (HP:0008944), global developmental delay (HP:0001263), areflexia (HP:0001284), and auditory neuropathy (HP:0030043).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The combination of severe, congenital hypotonia (\"floppy baby\"), areflexia/neuropathy, and hearing impairment is highly suggestive of an SPTBN4-related disorder. Testing should be considered in patients with a non-5q spinal muscular atrophy-like phenotype.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The clinical presentation overlaps with other congenital myopathies, congenital muscular dystrophies, and other genetic causes of severe neonatal hypotonia and neuropathy. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a key differential diagnosis to exclude.\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in SPTBN4 (1/1):\nN/A.

                "description": "CHRNA7 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: CHRNA7**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 1960.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 118511.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (OMIM #612001) is the primary disease associated with alterations in *CHRNA7*. The gene is also implicated in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The role of *CHRNA7* deletion in the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome phenotype is well-established. However, the pathogenicity of duplications is less certain due to variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, though many cases arise *de novo*. Duplications are more frequently inherited from an unaffected parent, complicating clinical interpretation.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Based on gnomAD v2.1.1, *CHRNA7* has a probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score of 0.00, indicating it is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction (LOEUF) score is 1.08. The gene is not predicted to be associated with recessive disease (pRec = 0.02).\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores suggest that heterozygous loss-of-function point mutations within the general population are tolerated and that haploinsufficiency from sequence variants is not a common disease mechanism. This contrasts with the known pathogenicity of whole-gene deletions via CNV.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Copy number variations (CNVs), specifically microdeletions encompassing the entire gene, are the primary pathogenic variant class. The role of individual missense or nonsense variants is less clear, though rare promoter variants that reduce transcription have been noted in ASD cases.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Intellectual disability (HP:0001249).\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0100711).\n    *   Hypotonia (HP:0001252).\n    *   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (HP:0007018).\n    *   Schizophrenia (HP:0100753).\n    *   Developmental regression (HP:0002376).\n    *   Motor delay (HP:0001270).\n    *   Anxiety (HP:0000739).\n    *   Aggressive behavior (HP:0100718).\n    *   Short stature (HP:0004322).\n    *   Mood disorders (HP:0000708).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Obsessive-compulsive behavior (HP:0000722).\n    *   Bipolar disorder (HP:0007302).\n    *   Tourette syndrome (HP:0001282).\n    *   Abnormality of brain morphology (HP:0002011).\n    *   Dyslexia (HP:0002336).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes are typically identified in childhood due to the presentation of developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. Neuropsychiatric features like schizophrenia may manifest in adolescence or early adulthood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The clinical presentation is highly variable. Deletions generally cause more severe and highly penetrant phenotypes compared to duplications. Individuals with zero to four copies of *CHRNA7* have been reported, showing a range of clinical severity.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Deletions (Haploinsufficiency):** Heterozygous deletions are strongly associated with intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delay (15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome).\n    *   **Duplications:** Associated with a wider, more variable spectrum of neuropsychiatric phenotypes including ASD, ADHD, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. Penetrance is incomplete and expressivity is highly variable.\n    *   **Triplications:** A three-generation family with *CHRNA7* triplication displayed various neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including anxiety, bipolar disorder, and developmental delay, providing further evidence for dosage sensitivity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between 15q13.3 microdeletions and a core phenotype of ID, epilepsy, and developmental delay is strong. The correlation for duplications and neuropsychiatric disorders is considered moderate due to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** The phenotype is primarily linked to copy number of the entire gene rather than specific intragenic variants. The 1.5 Mb deletion at 15q13.3 (Type 1) is the recurrent CNV encompassing *CHRNA7* that causes the associated syndrome.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\nGiven that the primary pathogenic mechanism is CNV, a list of single nucleotide variants is not the most clinically relevant representation. The critical pathogenic variant is the recurrent microdeletion at chromosome 15q13.3.\n*   **Variant:** nsv469778 (representative of the 1.5 Mb 15q13.3 microdeletion).\n*   **Type:** Copy number loss / deletion.\n*   **ClinVar Significance:** Pathogenic.\n*   **Reported Phenotypes:** Intellectual disability (HP:0001249), Seizures (HP:0001250), Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750), Hypotonia (HP:0001252), Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0100711).\n*   **AF:** Frequency in the general population is low, but it is one of the more common pathogenic CNVs.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, *CHRNA7* shows notable expression in the brain (especially cerebellum), adrenal gland, and pituitary gland. It is also expressed in the lung, spleen, and skin.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the brain, particularly the hippocampus, aligns with the observed neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric phenotypes like cognitive deficits, seizures, learning, and memory problems. Expression in immune cells is relevant to its role in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The gene is critical during neurodevelopment, which explains the childhood onset of many associated phenotypes. Its ongoing role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release throughout life contributes to the manifestation of psychiatric disorders in adolescence and adulthood.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The *CHRNA7* gene encodes the alpha-7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17-nAChR), a ligand-gated ion channel that, upon binding acetylcholine, opens to allow the influx of cations, including a high permeability to calcium.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:**\n    *   **Haploinsufficiency:** Deletion of one copy of *CHRNA7* leads to a reduced dosage of the \u03b17-nAChR protein, which is the primary mechanism for 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome.\n    *   **Gene Dosage Effect:** Both deletions and duplications/triplications result in altered gene dosage, demonstrating that the human brain is highly sensitive to the amount of *CHRNA7* product. Unexpectedly, both deletions and duplications have been shown to lead to decreased \u03b17-nAChR-associated calcium flux in cellular models.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of *CHRNA7* impacts cholinergic synaptic transmission and calcium signaling. This impairs neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal excitability, leading to cognitive deficits (learning/memory), seizures, and behavioral abnormalities. The gene is also a key component of the \"cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway,\" which modulates systemic inflammation.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The partially duplicated gene *CHRFAM7A* can form a hybrid transcript that acts as a dominant-negative regulator of \u03b17-nAChR function, reducing the number of functional receptors and potentially modifying the phenotype.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Deletions of *CHRNA7* are found in approximately 1% of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies. The 15q13.3 microdeletion is a recurrent finding in cohorts of individuals with intellectual disability, ASD, and schizophrenia.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for *CHRNA7* CNVs (via chromosomal microarray) is indicated for patients with unexplained intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, autism spectrum disorder, or schizophrenia.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identification of a pathogenic *CHRNA7* CNV confirms a genetic diagnosis, allowing for anticipatory guidance and management of associated features like seizures and developmental delays. It can also inform prognosis and family planning.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the concepts of autosomal dominant inheritance, *de novo* occurrence, incomplete penetrance, and variable expressivity, particularly for duplications. The possibility of an unaffected carrier parent must be discussed.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Sharp, A.J. et al. (2008). *Nat Genet*. PMID: 18536732.** A landmark paper that first described the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome as a novel recurrent genomic disorder associated with ID and epilepsy, identifying *CHRNA7* as a key candidate gene.\n*   **van Bon, B.W.M. et al.

PMID: 24424110.** The first report of a *CHRNA7* triplication co-segregating with neuropsychiatric phenotypes in a family, reinforcing the gene's dosage sensitivity.\n*   **Gillentine, M.A. & Schaaf, C.P. (2015). *Biochem Pharmacol*. PMID: 26095975.** A comprehensive review summarizing the clinical phenotypes associated with altered *CHRNA7* copy number (from zero to four copies), clarifying genotype-phenotype correlations.\n*   **Gillentine, M.A. et al. (2017). *J Neurodev Disord*. PMID: 28932289.** This study detailed the clinical and behavioral phenotypes of 18 children with *CHRNA7* duplications, emphasizing the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance.\n*   **Masi, A. et al. (2015). *Am J Med Genet B*. PMID: 25656121.** This was the first study to perform sequence variant analysis of *CHRNA7* in an ASD cohort, highlighting the technical challenges due to the *CHRFAM7A* fusion gene and identifying rare, functional promoter variants.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   A heterozygous microdeletion of *CHRNA7* is strongly associated with a core phenotype of Intellectual disability (HP:0001249), Seizures (HP:0001250), and Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   A heterozygous microduplication of *CHRNA7* is associated with a broader, more variable phenotype that includes Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0100711), ADHD (HP:0007018), and Schizophrenia (HP:0100753), but with incomplete penetrance.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of intellectual disability, early-onset seizures (especially idiopathic generalized epilepsy), and features of ASD should strongly suggest testing for a 15q13.3 CNV involving *CHRNA7*.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome overlaps with other genomic disorders and epilepsy syndromes. The broad neuropsychiatric phenotypes seen with *CHRNA7* duplications overlap with numerous other genetic and multifactorial conditions.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in CHRNA7 (1/1):\nN/A.

This is consistent with the primary disease, clEDS, being a recessive condition where heterozygous carriers are often mildly affected or asymptomatic.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**:\n    *   **Null variants**: Nonsense, frameshift, splice-site variants, and whole-gene deletions that lead to a complete absence of functional protein are the most common cause of autosomal recessive clEDS.\n    *   **Gene conversion events**: Recombination events with the highly homologous pseudogene, *TNXA*, are a recurrent mechanism of pathogenicity, creating chimeric genes. These events introduce deleterious sequences, such as a 120-bp deletion or the c.12174C>G (p.Cys4058Trp) missense variant, into *TNXB*.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms** (Ranked by approximate frequency for clEDS):\n    1.  Skin hyperextensibility (HP:0000974) - 100%.\n    2.  Joint hypermobility (HP:0001382) - 100%.\n    3.  Easy bruising (HP:0000978) - ~91%.\n    4.  Soft skin (HP:0000977).\n    5.  Myalgia (HP:0003326).\n    6.  Pes planus (HP:0001763).\n    7.  Arthralgia (HP:0002829).\n    8.  Piezogenic pedal papules (HP:0010733).\n    9.  Muscle weakness (HP:0001324).\n    10. Fatigue (HP:0012378).\n    11. Axonal polyneuropathy (HP:0003477).\n    12. Hematoma formation (HP:0032239).\n    13. Rectal prolapse (HP:0002035).\n    14. Uterine prolapse (HP:0001990).\n    15. Brachydactyly (HP:0001156).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**:\n    *   Vesicoureteral reflux (HP:0000076).\n    *   Edema of the lower limbs (HP:0010741).\n    *   Mitral valve prolapse (HP:0001634).\n    *   Arrhythmia (HP:0011675).\n    *   Mild atrophic scarring (HP:0001075) - Notably, severe atrophic \"cigarette paper\" scars seen in classic EDS are absent.\n    *   Gastrointestinal dysmotility.\n    *   Proximal muscle weakness (HP:0003701).\n    *   Distal muscle weakness (HP:0009053).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: The diagnosis of clEDS is often made in adulthood. However, clinical features such as joint hypermobility and easy bruising are present from childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Severity ranges from mild joint hypermobility in some heterozygous carriers to a multi-systemic disorder in individuals with biallelic null mutations, featuring significant musculoskeletal, skin, and neurological symptoms.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**:\n    *   **Biallelic null variants**: These genotypes, resulting from nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations, consistently lead to a complete lack of tenascin-X protein and the classic-like EDS phenotype.\n    *   **Homozygous 30-kb deletion**: Deletion of *CYP21A2* and *TNXB* due to unequal crossover causes congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) combined with clEDS, known as CAH-X syndrome.\n    *   **Heterozygous variants**: Haploinsufficiency of TNXB is associated with hypermobility type EDS (hEDS), often characterized by joint hypermobility, pain, and soft skin, but without the full constellation of features seen in clEDS.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: The pathogenic missense variant p.Cys4058Trp, often resulting from a gene conversion event, affects a cysteine residue predicted to be critical for a disulfide bond, thereby disrupting the protein's tertiary structure.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: To date, no specific genotype-phenotype correlations within the clEDS spectrum have been firmly established.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.11435_11524+30del (120-bp deletion) & c.12174C>G, p.(Cys4058Trp)** / ClinVar Significance: Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic-like, 1; Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, CAH-X type / This combination characterizes a common gene conversion event (TNXA/TNXB chimera 1).\n*   **c.12174C>G, p.(Cys4058Trp)** / ClinVar Significance: Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic-like, 1; Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type / This variant alone characterizes a distinct gene conversion event (chimera 2).\n*   **Complete or partial gene deletions** / ClinVar Significance: Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic-like, 1; Congenital adrenal hyperplasia / Large deletions often also involve the adjacent *CYP21A2* gene.\n*   **NM_001365276.2(TNXB):c.8473G>A, p.(Glu2825Lys)** / ClinVar Significance: Likely Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome due to tenascin-X deficiency.\n*   **NM_019105.8:c.5362del, p.(Thr1788Profs*100)** / ClinVar Significance: Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: classic-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome / This novel frameshift variant was shown to cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.\n*   **NM_019105.8:c.8278C>T, p.(Gln2760*)** / ClinVar Significance: Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: classic-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome / A novel nonsense variant identified in an Italian patient.\n*   **6074A > T nucleotide transition, p.(Asp2025Val)** / ClinVar Significance: Reported as Likely Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with severe joint pain, hypermobility, and muscle weakness.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues**: GTEx data shows high expression of TNXB in tissues rich in connective tissue, including adrenal gland, artery (aorta and tibial), skin, colon, lung, and adipose tissue.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**:\n    *   **Skin, Joints, Muscle**: High expression in these tissues correlates directly with the primary clEDS phenotypes of skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and myopathy.\n    *   **Adrenal Gland**: Proximity and co-deletion with the *CYP21A2* gene, which is highly expressed in the adrenal gland, explains the combined CAH-X syndrome phenotype.\n    *   **Gastrointestinal Tract**: Expression in the colon and other GI tissues may underlie symptoms like rectal prolapse and dysmotility.\n*   **Expression During Development**: Tenascin-X is involved in matrix maturation and wound healing, suggesting its expression is critical throughout life for tissue homeostasis.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: Tenascin-X is an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein that organizes and maintains the structural integrity of connective tissues by regulating the production and assembly of collagen fibrils and elastic fibers.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**:\n    *   **Loss-of-Function**: Recessive clEDS is caused by biallelic null variants leading to a complete absence of tenascin-X protein, which disrupts the structure of the ECM.\n    *   **Haploinsufficiency**: Dominant hEDS associated with TNXB is caused by heterozygous variants that reduce the amount of functional tenascin-X protein by approximately half.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**:\n    *   **ECM Organization**: The absence of tenascin-X leads to disorganized and sparse collagen fibrils and abnormal elastic fibers in the dermis, weakening connective tissue.\n    *   **TGF-\u03b2 Signaling**: The fibrinogen-related domain of tenascin-X can modulate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, which is critical for tissue fibrosis and wound healing.\n    *   **PI3K/Akt Signaling**: Tenascin-X may play a role in regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, with downstream effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield**: TNXB variants are an underdiagnosed cause of EDS-like symptoms, partly due to the technical challenges of sequencing imposed by the *TNXA* pseudogene. NGS panels that can accurately distinguish the gene from the pseudogene are required for effective screening.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing**: Testing is indicated for patients presenting with clinical features of classic or hypermobile EDS, especially when atrophic scarring is absent or when accompanied by features like significant myalgia, neuropathy, or organ prolapse. It is also indicated in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who show signs of a connective tissue disorder.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management**: Management is symptomatic and proactive, including physical therapy to strengthen muscles without overburdening joints, pain management (often avoiding opioids for chronic pain), and surveillance for cardiac, gastrointestinal, and gynecological complications.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling for clEDS involves explaining its autosomal recessive inheritance and the 25% recurrence risk for sibs. The presence of the highly homologous *TNXA* pseudogene complicates molecular diagnosis, requiring specialized laboratory techniques like long-range PCR or MLPA for accurate variant detection, especially for deletions and gene conversion events. Testing of heterozygous carriers is possible once the familial variants are known.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Schalkwijk et al., 2001 (NEJM)**: First described a recessive form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome caused by a deficiency of tenascin-X, linking the protein absence to the phenotype of hyperextensible skin and joint hypermobility without atrophic scarring.\n*   **Zweers et al., 2003 (AJHG)**: Provided the first evidence that haploinsufficiency of TNXB is associated with the hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n*   **Demirdas et al., 2017 (Clin Genet)**: A key study that delineated the clinical spectrum of TNXB-related clEDS in 17 individuals, highlighting features like easy bruising, foot anomalies, myopathy, and neuropathy, and discussing diagnostic challenges.\n*   **Malfait et al., 2017 (Am J Med Genet C)**: The 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, which formally defined \"Classical-like EDS\" (clEDS) as a distinct subtype caused by TNXB deficiency.\n*   **Green et al., 2020 (Clin Genet)**: Described the clinical and molecular characteristics of 20 patients with clEDS, reinforcing the core phenotype and noting the high frequency of gene conversion events involving the *TNXA* pseudogene.\n*   **Chen et al., 2023 (Front. Mol. Biosci.)**: A comprehensive review summarizing the roles of tenascin-X in clEDS, pain pathogenesis, tumor suppression, and fibrosis, referencing the *Tnxb-/-* mouse model.\n*   **Morissette et al., 2015 (Am J Med Genet C)**: Detailed the CAH-X syndrome, a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving *CYP21A2* and *TNXB*, linking congenital adrenal hyperplasia with EDS phenotypes.\n*   **Miki et al., 2023 (Front Genet)**: Developed and validated an NGS-based screening system to accurately detect TNXB variants, including those derived from the *TNXA* pseudogene, in a cohort of nine clEDS patients.\n*   **Ritelli et al., 2019 (Genes)**: Reported two Italian patients with clEDS due to novel compound heterozygous null variants in TNXB, highlighting that the disorder is likely underdiagnosed outside of specific populations.\n*   **Kaufman & Butler, 2016 (World J Med Genet)**: Case report of a patient with a specific *TNXB* missense mutation presenting with moderate to severe EDS symptoms, contributing to the catalogue of pathogenic variants.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**:\n    *   Biallelic null variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, large deletions, pathogenic gene conversions) are strongly associated with the full clEDS phenotype, characterized by a triad of **Skin hyperextensibility (HP:0000974)**, **Joint hypermobility (HP:0001382)**, and **Easy bruising (HP:0000978)**.\n    *   Heterozygous null or missense variants (causing haploinsufficiency) are associated with **Joint hypermobility (HP:0001382)** as part of a diagnosis of hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags**:\n    *   The presence of classic EDS features (significant skin hyperextensibility and generalized joint hypermobility) in the **absence of atrophic, \"cigarette paper\" scarring** is a primary red flag for TNXB-related clEDS.\n    *   Co-occurrence of a hypermobility spectrum disorder with **early-onset and significant myalgia (HP:0003326)**, **muscle weakness (HP:0001324)**, or signs of **axonal polyneuropathy (HP:0003477)** should raise suspicion for *TNXB* mutations.\n    *   The combination of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) with EDS features is a strong indicator for a contiguous gene deletion involving *CYP21A2* and *TNXB*.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**:\n    *   **Classical EDS (cEDS)**: Caused by *COL5A1* or *COL5A2* variants. Overlaps in skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility, but is distinguished by the presence of prominent atrophic scarring, which is characteristically absent in clEDS.\n    *   **Hypermobile EDS (hEDS)**: The genetic basis is largely unknown, but a subset of cases have *TNXB* heterozygous variants. Distinguishing hEDS from clEDS relies on the severity of skin hyperextensibility, which is typically mild or absent in hEDS.\n    *   **Other Connective Tissue Disorders**: Conditions like Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and other rare EDS types should be considered, but can typically be differentiated by their distinct clinical features and genetic causes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in TNXB (1/1):\nN/A.

Pseudodominance has been observed due to the high carrier frequency of p.Cys282Tyr in European populations.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v4 constraint metrics for HFE are pLI = 1.39e-11, LOEUF = 1.05, pRec = 0, and pNull = 1.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A high pLI score (typically \u2265 0.9) suggests a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The very low pLI and high LOEUF for HFE indicate that it is not constrained against LoF variants, which aligns with the recessive nature of the disease where heterozygotes are generally unaffected.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Missense variants are the most common cause of HFE-related hemochromatosis. Nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants have also been reported.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Elevated serum ferritin (HP:0003281)\n    *   Increased transferrin saturation (HP:0003155)\n    *   Hepatocellular carcinoma (HP:0001402)\n    *   Cirrhosis (HP:0001394)\n    *   Arthropathy (HP:0001369)\n    *   Hepatomegaly (HP:0002240)\n    *   Diabetes mellitus (HP:0000819)\n    *   Cardiomyopathy (HP:0001638)\n    *   Skin hyperpigmentation (HP:0000953)\n    *   Fatigue/Lethargy (HP:0012378, HP:0001947)\n    *   Abdominal pain (HP:0002027)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HP:0000044)\n    *   Alopecia (HP:0001596)\n    *   Hepatic steatosis (HP:0001397)\n    *   Fragile skin (HP:0001030)\n    *   Polycythemia vera (HP:0001897)\n    *   Intellectual disability (Rare) (HP:0001249)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Clinical manifestations typically appear between 40 and 60 years of age in males and after menopause in females. Juvenile onset is rare and usually associated with other hemochromatosis genes.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotypic spectrum is highly variable, ranging from non-penetrant (no clinical or biochemical signs), to biochemical (elevated iron markers without end-organ damage), to clinical HFE hemochromatosis with significant end-organ damage.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygosity for the p.Cys282Tyr missense variant is the most common genotype and is associated with the classic adult-onset hemochromatosis phenotype. Compound heterozygosity for p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp can lead to a milder phenotype with elevated iron levels, but often without overt clinical disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The p.Cys282Y mutation is located in the \u03b13 domain of the HFE protein and disrupts its interaction with beta-2 microglobulin, preventing its transport to the cell surface. The p.His63Asp variant is located in the \u03b11 domain and may have a lesser effect on protein function.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is strong for the p.Cys282Y homozygous genotype leading to biochemical iron overload, but the clinical penetrance is low and variable. Other genetic and environmental factors modify the phenotype.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   p.Cys282Tyr homozygosity is strongly associated with increased serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, with a subset of individuals developing cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and diabetes.\n    *   p.Cys282Tyr/p.His63Asp compound heterozygosity is associated with a lower risk of hemochromatosis-related morbidity compared to p.Cys282Y homozygotes.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **rs1800562 / c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) / Pathogenic (low penetrance):** Associated with Hemochromatosis Type 1, characterized by elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, with potential for liver disease, diabetes, and arthropathy. AF (gnomAD): ~3.7%\n*   **rs1799945 / c.187C>G (p.His63Asp) / VUS/Likely Benign:** When compounded with p.Cys282Y, may lead to mild hyperferritinemia. AF (gnomAD): ~8.6%.\n*   **rs146519482 / c.502G>T (p.Glu168Ter) / Pathogenic:** Causes loss of function and can lead to hemochromatosis, especially when compounded with p.Cys282Y. AF (gnomAD): Rare.\n*   **rs759524388 / c.211C>T (p.Arg71Ter) / Pathogenic:** A rare nonsense mutation associated with hemochromatosis. AF (gnomAD): Very rare.\n*   **rs573745685 / c.1006+1G>A / Pathogenic:** A splice site variant leading to loss of function and hemochromatosis. AF (gnomAD): Very rare.\n*   **rs765804978 / c.546_547del (p.Leu183fs) / Pathogenic:** A frameshift variant causing a truncated, non-functional protein. AF (gnomAD): Very rare.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** HFE is highly expressed in the liver and small intestine. This is consistent with its role in regulating iron absorption in the gut and iron storage in the liver.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Liver dysfunction, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, is a primary phenotype due to iron accumulation. Pancreatic iron deposition can lead to diabetes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The age-related onset of symptoms is due to the progressive accumulation of iron over decades.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The HFE protein interacts with the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to regulate the uptake of iron into cells and is crucial for the normal regulation of hepcidin, the main hormone controlling iron metabolism.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is loss-of-function due to mutations that impair the HFE protein's ability to reach the cell surface or bind to its partners. This leads to reduced hepcidin expression, causing increased intestinal iron absorption and iron overload in various organs.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the HFE-TfR1 interaction and subsequent low hepcidin levels lead to increased activity of the iron exporter ferroportin on enterocytes and macrophages. This results in excessive iron loading in the plasma and deposition in tissues like the liver, heart, and pancreas, causing oxidative damage and organ dysfunction.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction of HFE with beta-2 microglobulin is essential for its proper cell surface localization. The interaction with TfR1 is key to its iron-sensing function, and it is thought to modulate the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway to regulate hepcidin.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In individuals of Northern European descent with clinical signs of hemochromatosis, homozygosity for the p.Cys282Y mutation is found in about 80-90% of cases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Testing for HFE mutations is typically performed in individuals with elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, or with a family history of hemochromatosis.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Early diagnosis and treatment with therapeutic phlebotomy to remove excess iron can prevent organ damage and lead to a normal life expectancy.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, the low and variable clinical penetrance of the p.Cys282Y homozygous genotype, and the lower risk associated with other genotypes like compound heterozygosity. Family screening can identify at-risk relatives.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Feder JN, et al. (1996) Nat Genet.

        "TNXB": "TNXB Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID**: 11976.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID**: 600985.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations**:\n    *   Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic-like, type 1 (clEDS), an autosomal recessive condition, is the primary disease associated with biallelic pathogenic variants in TNXB.\n    *   TNXB haploinsufficiency has been associated with the hypermobility type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS).\n    *   Familial vesicoureteral reflux has been linked to heterozygous variants in some families, though the evidence is not yet definitive.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The association between TNXB and \"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome due to tenascin-X deficiency\" is rated as **Strong** by the Genomics England PanelApp.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients**:\n    *   **Autosomal Recessive**: Biallelic pathogenic variants result in classic-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (clEDS), which is characterized by a complete absence of the tenascin-X protein.\n    *   **Autosomal Dominant**: Heterozygous variants that lead to reduced tenascin-X levels (haploinsufficiency) are associated with a percentage of cases of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS).\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: TNXB is not highly constrained against loss-of-function variants. The gnomAD v2.1.1 scores are pLI = 0.00, pNull = 1.00, and pRec = 0.00. The LOEUF score is 1.03, which does not indicate intolerance to loss-of-function variation.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that the loss of one copy of the TNXB gene is generally tolerated in the large population sample of gnomAD. This is consistent with the primary disease, clEDS, being a recessive condition where heterozygous carriers are often mildly affected or asymptomatic.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**:\n    *   **Null variants**: Nonsense, frameshift, splice-site variants, and whole-gene deletions that lead to a complete absence of functional protein are the most common cause of autosomal recessive clEDS.\n    *   **Gene conversion events**: Recombination events with the highly homologous pseudogene, *TNXA*, are a recurrent mechanism of pathogenicity, creating chimeric genes. These events introduce deleterious sequences, such as a 120-bp deletion or the c.12174C>G (p.Cys4058Trp) missense variant, into *TNXB*.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms** (Ranked by approximate frequency for clEDS):\n    1.

However, clinical features such as joint hypermobility and easy bruising are present from childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Severity ranges from mild joint hypermobility in some heterozygous carriers to a multi-systemic disorder in individuals with biallelic null mutations, featuring significant musculoskeletal, skin, and neurological symptoms.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**:\n    *   **Biallelic null variants**: These genotypes, resulting from nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations, consistently lead to a complete lack of tenascin-X protein and the classic-like EDS phenotype.\n    *   **Homozygous 30-kb deletion**: Deletion of *CYP21A2* and *TNXB* due to unequal crossover causes congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) combined with clEDS, known as CAH-X syndrome.\n    *   **Heterozygous variants**: Haploinsufficiency of TNXB is associated with hypermobility type EDS (hEDS), often characterized by joint hypermobility, pain, and soft skin, but without the full constellation of features seen in clEDS.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: The pathogenic missense variant p.Cys4058Trp, often resulting from a gene conversion event, affects a cysteine residue predicted to be critical for a disulfide bond, thereby disrupting the protein's tertiary structure.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: To date, no specific genotype-phenotype correlations within the clEDS spectrum have been firmly established.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.11435_11524+30del (120-bp deletion) & c.12174C>G, p.(Cys4058Trp)** / ClinVar Significance: Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic-like, 1;

NGS panels that can accurately distinguish the gene from the pseudogene are required for effective screening.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing**: Testing is indicated for patients presenting with clinical features of classic or hypermobile EDS, especially when atrophic scarring is absent or when accompanied by features like significant myalgia, neuropathy, or organ prolapse. It is also indicated in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who show signs of a connective tissue disorder.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management**: Management is symptomatic and proactive, including physical therapy to strengthen muscles without overburdening joints, pain management (often avoiding opioids for chronic pain), and surveillance for cardiac, gastrointestinal, and gynecological complications.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling for clEDS involves explaining its autosomal recessive inheritance and the 25% recurrence risk for sibs. The presence of the highly homologous *TNXA* pseudogene complicates molecular diagnosis, requiring specialized laboratory techniques like long-range PCR or MLPA for accurate variant detection, especially for deletions and gene conversion events. Testing of heterozygous carriers is possible once the familial variants are known.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Schalkwijk et al., 2001 (NEJM)**: First described a recessive form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome caused by a deficiency of tenascin-X, linking the protein absence to the phenotype of hyperextensible skin and joint hypermobility without atrophic scarring.\n*   **Zweers et al., 2003 (AJHG)**: Provided the first evidence that haploinsufficiency of TNXB is associated with the hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n*   **Demirdas et al., 2017 (Clin Genet)**: A key study that delineated the clinical spectrum of TNXB-related clEDS in 17 individuals, highlighting features like easy bruising, foot anomalies, myopathy, and neuropathy, and discussing diagnostic challenges.\n*   **Malfait et al., 2017 (Am J Med Genet C)**: The 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, which formally defined \"Classical-like EDS\" (clEDS) as a distinct subtype caused by TNXB deficiency.\n*   **Green et al., 2020 (Clin Genet)**: Described the clinical and molecular characteristics of 20 patients with clEDS, reinforcing the core phenotype and noting the high frequency of gene conversion events involving the *TNXA* pseudogene.\n*   **Chen et al., 2023 (Front.

Overlaps in skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility, but is distinguished by the presence of prominent atrophic scarring, which is characteristically absent in clEDS.\n    *   **Hypermobile EDS (hEDS)**: The genetic basis is largely unknown, but a subset of cases have *TNXB* heterozygous variants. Distinguishing hEDS from clEDS relies on the severity of skin hyperextensibility, which is typically mild or absent in hEDS.\n    *   **Other Connective Tissue Disorders**: Conditions like Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and other rare EDS types should be considered, but can typically be differentiated by their distinct clinical features and genetic causes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in TNXB (1/1):\nN/A.

Atopic dermatitis risk is also dose-dependent.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint scores for *FLG* are pLI = 0.00, LOEUF = 1.15. The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) is low.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI score indicates that the gene is tolerant to heterozygous loss-of-function variation in the general population, which is consistent with the high prevalence of heterozygous carriers. Disease is associated with biallelic LoF mutations (more severe) or heterozygous LoF mutations (milder phenotype or risk factor).\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift) are the established pathogenic class. These mutations typically lead to a truncated, non-functional profilaggrin protein.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Ichthyosis (HP:0008064).\n    *   Atopic dermatitis (HP:0000964).\n    *   Palmar hyperlinearity (HP:0001053).\n    *   Keratosis pilaris (HP:0000995).\n    *   Xerosis (HP:0000934).\n    *   Asthma (HP:0002099).\n    *   Allergic rhinitis (HP:0003192).\n    *   Food allergy (HP:0002097).\n    *   Flexural eczema (HP:0010582).\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Pityriasis alba (HP:0001056).\n    *   Pulpitis sicca (dry fingertips).\n    *   Elevated circulating IgE level (HP:0003212).\n    *   Dirty neck (hyperlinearity and hyperpigmentation of the neck).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically in early childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity is variable and correlates with the number of *FLG* null alleles; homozygous or compound heterozygous individuals have more severe ichthyosis vulgaris than heterozygotes. The presence of LoF variants is associated with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Loss-of-function (null) mutations reduce the amount of functional filaggrin protein, leading to impaired skin barrier function.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The *FLG* gene consists of a large third exon with 10-12 tandem repeats, each coding for a filaggrin monomer. Loss-of-function mutations affecting the profilaggrin protein result in an absence of functional filaggrin.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is strong; having two LoF mutations (homozygous or compound heterozygous) is highly correlated with the clinical diagnosis of ichthyosis vulgaris. Heterozygous carriers have a milder phenotype or are predisposed to atopic dermatitis.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** The common European null mutations R501X and 2282del4 are strongly associated with ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis. Children with the R501X mutation may be less responsive to therapy for atopic dermatitis.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1501C>T (p.Arg501Ter) / rs61816761 / Pathogenic:** Associated with ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis. Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes exhibit a more severe phenotype.\n*   **c.6843del4 (p.Ser2282fs) / 2282del4 / Pathogenic:** Associated with ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis.\n*   **c.7339C>T (p.Arg2447Ter) / rs138669348 / Pathogenic:** Associated with ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis.\n*   **c.9739T>X (p.Ser3247Ter) / S3247X / Pathogenic:** Associated with ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis.\n*   **c.3321delA / Pathogenic:** Reported in Chinese populations with ichthyosis vulgaris.\n*   **c.477-478insA / Pathogenic (novel):** Identified in a Chinese pedigree with ichthyosis vulgaris.\n*   **c.6218-6219delAA / Pathogenic (novel):** Identified as a de novo mutation in a Chinese individual with ichthyosis vulgaris.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** *FLG* is most highly expressed in the skin. This tissue-specific expression directly correlates with the dermatological phenotypes seen in patients with pathogenic variants.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The primary phenotypes are cutaneous, including skin dryness (xerosis), scaling (ichthyosis), and inflammation (eczema), due to the protein's role in epidermal barrier formation.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Filaggrin is expressed in terminally differentiating keratinocytes in the outermost layers of the epidermis. The clinical presentation often begins in early childhood.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The *FLG* gene encodes profilaggrin, which is cleaved into multiple filaggrin protein monomers that are critical for bundling keratin filaments and forming the cornified cell envelope of the epidermis.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is loss-of-function, leading to filaggrin haploinsufficiency. This results in a reduced amount of functional filaggrin protein, with a gene-dosage effect observed.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Reduced filaggrin impairs keratin aggregation and the formation of the skin's barrier, leading to increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and enhanced penetration of allergens and irritants. This contributes to dry skin, ichthyosis, and atopic conditions.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Filaggrin aggregates keratin intermediate filaments, a crucial step in the terminal differentiation of epidermal cells to form a flattened, strong physical barrier.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Up to half of patients with atopic dermatitis may carry an *FLG* mutation. Testing for common mutations like R501X and 2282del4 has a high yield in European patients with ichthyosis vulgaris.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is indicated for individuals with clinical signs of ichthyosis vulgaris or moderate-to-severe, early-onset atopic dermatitis, particularly with a family history of atopy.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identifying *FLG* mutations can confirm a diagnosis, inform prognosis (e.g., risk of persistent atopic dermatitis), and guide management focused on aggressive skin barrier repair and moisturization.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the semi-dominant inheritance pattern, the variable expressivity, and the increased risk for associated atopic conditions like asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 35368383 (2024):** Identified novel and established *FLG* LoF variants in a pediatric cohort, associating them with higher transepidermal water loss and moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.\n*   **PMID: 23421459 (2013):** Confirmed associations between *FLG* null mutations and specific phenotypes including flexural eczema, xerosis, hyperlinear palms, and keratosis pilaris in a cohort with occupational eczema.\n*   **PMID: 22299762 (2012):** Identified two novel *FLG* null mutations in Chinese pedigrees with ichthyosis vulgaris, expanding the mutational spectrum.\n*   **PMID: 22154943 (2012):** A landmark review detailing filaggrin's multifunctional role in skin barrier maintenance and its association with ichthyosis vulgaris, atopic eczema, asthma, and allergies.\n*   **PMID: 22002933 (2011):** Demonstrated that intragenic copy number variation (CNV) in *FLG* contributes to atopic dermatitis risk in a dose-dependent manner, independent of null mutations.\n*   **PMID: 16444271 (2006):** A foundational study that identified loss-of-function mutations in *FLG* as the underlying cause of ichthyosis vulgaris.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function variants (e.g., R501X, 2282del4) are strongly associated with Ichthyosis (HP:0008064), Palmar hyperlinearity (HP:0001053), and Keratosis pilaris (HP:0000995).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of early-onset ichthyosis or severe atopic dermatitis with prominent palmar hyperlinearity and keratosis pilaris is highly suggestive of pathogenic variants in *FLG*.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The atopic manifestations overlap with those caused by variants in other immune-pathway genes, but the prominent ichthyosis and barrier-defect features are more specific to *FLG*.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in FLG (2/2):\nN/A.

        "KRT6C": "KRT6C Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: KRT6C**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   HGNC ID: 20406.\n*   OMIM Gene ID: 612315.\n*   Primary Disease Associations: Autosomal dominant focal non-epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma (PPKNEFD, OMIM #615735).\n*   Clinical Significance Level: Pathogenic variants in *KRT6C* are a definitive cause of focal palmoplantar keratoderma.\n*   Inheritance Patterns: Autosomal dominant.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   pLI: 0.00 (gnomAD v2.1.1).\n*   LOEUF: 1.15 (gnomAD v2.1.1).\n*   Clinical Interpretation: The pLI score near 0 indicates the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variants. This is consistent with the established dominant-negative disease mechanism, where a mutant protein disrupts function, rather than a loss of protein from one allele (haploinsufficiency).\n*   Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic: Missense variants and in-frame deletions that disrupt the keratin filament structure.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**:\n    *   Focal palmoplantar keratoderma (HP:0001056).\n    *   Plantar hyperkeratosis (HP:0007525).\n    *   Painful plantar callosities.\n    *   Palmoplantar blistering.\n    *   Palmoplantar pain.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**:\n    *   Nail dystrophy (HP:0008395) (typically minor or absent).\n    *   Toenail thickening (Onychauxis, HP:0001847).\n    *   Fingernail thickening (Onychauxis, HP:0001847).\n*   Age of Onset: The condition typically becomes apparent within the first few months of life.\n*   Phenotype Severity Spectrum: Phenotypes are generally considered a milder form within the pachyonychia congenita (PC) spectrum, primarily affecting the feet. Nail involvement is significantly less common (3-19%) compared to PC caused by other keratin genes like *KRT6A* (96-97%).\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   Variant Classes and Phenotypes: Heterozygous in-frame deletions and missense mutations result in a consistent phenotype of focal palmoplantar keratoderma, mainly affecting the plantar surfaces.\n*   Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype: Mutations largely cluster in the 1A and 2B domains of the keratin protein rod, which are critical for filament formation and assembly.\n*   Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength: There is a strong correlation between pathogenic variants in *KRT6C* and the development of focal plantar keratoderma, often without significant nail dystrophy.\n*   Examples:\n    *   p.Asn172del (c.516_518delCAA) is associated with familial focal PPK with minor or absent nail changes.\n    *   p.Glu472Lys (c.1414G>A) is associated with focal plantar keratoderma with normal palms and nails.\n    *   p.Ile462_Glu470del (c.1384_1410del27) is associated with familial focal PPK.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   c.516_518delCAA (p.Asn172del) / Pathogenic / Focal palmoplantar keratoderma (HP:0001056) / The deletion was found in 3 of 335 controls.\n*   c.1414G>A (p.Glu472Lys) / Pathogenic / Focal plantar keratoderma (HP:0007525) / AF not reported.\n*   c.1384_1410del27 (p.Ile462_Glu470del) / Pathogenic / Focal palmoplantar keratoderma (HP:0001056) / AF not reported.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   Highest Expressing Tissues: *KRT6C* is expressed in the plantar epidermis. GTEx data also shows expression in the esophagus mucosa, vagina, and tongue.\n*   Tissue-Specific Phenotypes: Expression in the plantar epidermis correlates directly with the primary phenotype of focal plantar keratoderma.\n*   Expression During Development: *KRT6C* is expressed in human fetal tissues between 10 and 20 weeks of gestation.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   Normal Gene Function: The *KRT6C* gene provides instructions for making keratin 6c, a protein that forms intermediate filaments to provide structural integrity and resilience to epithelial cells, particularly in the skin.\n*   Disease Mechanism: Dominant-negative. Mutant K6c protein alters the structure of the keratin intermediate filament network, making skin cells fragile and easily damaged by friction or minor trauma.\n*   Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted: The primary disruption is to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton organization. This leads to fragile skin cells that may abnormally increase keratin production in response to damage, worsening the keratoderma.\n*   Protein-Protein Interactions: K6c forms heterodimers with type I keratins, such as KRT16, to assemble into filaments. It has also been identified as a heterodimer partner for KRT9.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   Diagnostic Yield: In families presenting with familial focal PPK where other common keratin genes have been excluded, mutational analysis of *KRT6C* has a high diagnostic yield.\n*   Most Common Reasons for Testing: Patients with focal palmoplantar keratoderma, particularly with minimal or no nail involvement, who have a family history of the condition.\n*   Clinical Actionability: Diagnosis confirms the genetic basis of the keratoderma, allowing for targeted symptom management (e.g., pain relief, callus trimming) and accurate genetic counseling.\n*   Genetic Counseling Considerations: An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern means a 50% risk of transmission to offspring. The phenotype is generally limited to focal PPK, distinguishing it from more severe forms of pachyonychia congenita.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Wilson NJ, et al. J Hum Genet. 2010. (PMID: 19609311)**: First identified that mutations in *KRT6C* cause focal palmoplantar keratoderma, establishing it as a distinct genetic entity.\n*   **Wilson NJ, et al.

        "SPTBN4": "SPTBN4 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: SPTBN4**\n\nThis dossier provides a comprehensive clinical genetics summary for the SPTBN4 gene, focusing on genotype-phenotype correlations to aid in the assessment of genetic variants.\n\n***\n\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 14896.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 606214.\n*   **Primary Disease Association:** Biallelic pathogenic variants in SPTBN4 are associated with Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, neuropathy, and deafness (NEDHND), also referred to as SPTBN4-related disorder (OMIM #617519).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between SPTBN4 and NEDHND is considered definitive, based on multiple reports of pathogenic variants in affected individuals.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, requiring homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants. Parents are typically heterozygous carriers.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score helps to quantify a gene's intolerance to protein-truncating variants, with a score \u2265 0.9 indicating high intolerance. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is a continuous metric where lower values indicate greater intolerance to loss-of-function variation. Specific gnomAD constraint values for SPTBN4 were not available in the searched literature.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Genes with high pLI scores and low LOEUF scores are under strong negative selection against loss-of-function variants. For recessive diseases like NEDHND, constraint scores in heterozygotes (as represented in gnomAD) may not fully reflect the gene's essentiality when function is completely lost.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Loss-of-function variants, including nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site variants, are the most common pathogenic variant types. Multi-exon deletions and missense variants have also been reported as pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Congenital muscular hypotonia (HP:0008944).\n    *   Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).\n    *   Areflexia (HP:0001284).\n    *   Motor developmental delay (HP:0001270).\n    *   Absent speech (HP:0001344).\n    *   Intellectual disability, severe to profound (HP:0010864, HP:0002187).\n    *   Peripheral axonal neuropathy (HP:0003477).\n    *   Hearing impairment / Auditory neuropathy (HP:0000365, HP:0030043).\n    *   Feeding difficulties / Dysphagia (HP:0011968, HP:0002015).\n    *   Muscular atrophy (HP:0003202).\n    *   Respiratory insufficiency (HP:0002093).\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Horizontal nystagmus (HP:0000666).\n    *   Choreoathetosis (HP:0001266).\n    *   Cortical visual impairment (HP:0100704).\n    *   Joint contractures (HP:0001371).\n    *   Thin corpus callosum (HP:0002079).\n    *   Facial weakness / Myopathic facies (HP:0000324, HP:0002058).\n    *   Esotropia (HP:0000565).\n    *   Microphthalmia (HP:0000568).\n    *   High-arched palate (HP:0000218).\n    *   Broad nasal bridge (HP:0000431).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically congenital, with hypotonia and feeding difficulties often present at birth.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype is typically severe, with most individuals having profound developmental delay and lack of independent motor skills. However, a milder phenotype with preserved cognitive development has been reported in one family, indicating some variability.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Biallelic loss-of-function variants consistently lead to the core features of NEDHND.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No clear correlations between the location of the variant within the protein and specific phenotypic outcomes have been consistently established.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Currently considered weak or not well-established. One report described siblings with a homozygous splice-site variant who presented with axonal neuropathy but without intellectual disability, suggesting that some variants may lead to a less severe neurocognitive phenotype.\n*   **Examples:** A homozygous splice-site variant was associated with axonal neuropathy in the absence of intellectual disability in two siblings.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1090C>T (p.Gln364*):** Homozygous nonsense; Likely Pathogenic; Core NEDHND phenotype without hearing loss or epilepsy, but with dysmorphic features.\n*   **c.1799_1800delGC (p.Ala600Profs*90):** Homozygous frameshift; Pathogenic; Severe muscular hypotonia, dysphagia, absent speech, global developmental delay, and intellectual disability.\n*   **c.3375_3393del (p.Asp1126Thrfs*39):** Homozygous frameshift; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features including severe muscular hypotonia, dysphagia, and absent speech.\n*   **c.1247del (p.Leu417Tyrfs*5):** Homozygous frameshift; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **c.737G>C (p.Trp246Ser):** Compound heterozygous with a multi-exon deletion; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **c.1149dup (p.Asn384Glnfs*17):** Compound heterozygous; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **Multi-exon deletion (exons 6-11):** Compound heterozygous with a missense variant; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **c.1597C>T (p.Arg533*):** Homozygous nonsense; Pathogenic; First described case with congenital myopathy, deafness, and neuropathy.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues and Clinical Correlation:** SPTBN4 shows high expression in various brain regions, including the cerebellum, cortex, and thalamus, as well as in the retina and spinal cord. This expression pattern is highly consistent with the observed neurological phenotypes, including developmental delay, neuropathy, and visual impairment.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The prominent expression in the central and peripheral nervous system directly relates to the core phenotypes of neuropathy, intellectual disability, and hearing loss. The role in muscle is debated, with some evidence suggesting myopathy is a primary feature while other studies indicate it is secondary to denervation.\n*   **Expression During Development:** The gene's function is critical during neurodevelopment, as evidenced by the congenital onset of symptoms.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** SPTBN4 encodes \u03b2IV-spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein that links the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton and is crucial for organizing membrane domains in neurons.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is loss-of-function. Biallelic pathogenic variants disrupt the \u03b2IV-spectrin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the proper clustering and localization of voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels at the axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of ion channel clustering impairs the initiation and propagation of action potentials, leading to axonal neuropathy. The disruption of cytoskeletal integrity likely contributes to the broader neurodevelopmental defects, hypotonia, and auditory dysfunction.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** \u03b2IV-spectrin interacts with ankyrin-G to anchor ion channels in the neuronal membrane; disruption of this interaction is a key pathological event.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The exact diagnostic yield is unknown, but SPTBN4 variants are a rare cause of congenital hypotonia and neurodevelopmental disorders. Because the phenotype overlaps with many other neuromuscular disorders, a broad genetic testing approach, such as a multi-gene panel or exome sequencing, is recommended over single-gene testing.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for SPTBN4 is indicated in individuals presenting with congenital hypotonia, areflexia, global developmental delay, and sensorineural hearing loss, particularly after more common causes like spinal muscular atrophy have been excluded.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Management is supportive and symptomatic. This includes physical and occupational therapy, nutritional support via feeding tubes, respiratory support (e.g., BiPAP), standard anti-seizure medications, and hearing aids or other support for auditory neuropathy.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling is critical for affected families. As an autosomal recessive disorder, siblings of an affected individual have a 25% chance of being affected. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and options for prenatal or preimplantation genetic testing should be discussed.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Knierim et al., 2017 (PMID: 28540413):** First report describing a homozygous nonsense mutation in SPTBN4 causing a syndrome of congenital myopathy, deafness, and neuropathy.\n*   **Wang et al., 2018 (PMID: 29861105):** Described additional patients and demonstrated that loss-of-function variants disrupt sodium channel clustering, establishing neuropathy as a key feature.\n*   **GeneReviews, 2020:** Provided a comprehensive clinical overview of SPTBN4 disorder, summarizing the phenotype, diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling considerations.\n*   **Buelow et al., 2021 (PMID: 33772159):** Expanded the genetic and phenotypic spectrum with five new patients from four families, reporting novel variants and highlighting clinical similarities to non-5q SMA and congenital myopathies.\n*   **Gunay et al., 2023 (DOI: 10.54029/2023unk):** Reported a new homozygous nonsense variant and expanded the phenotype to include previously unreported dysmorphic features, reinforcing the core clinical features.\n*   **Al-Sagr et al., 2024 (Rare):** Described a novel homozygous frameshift variant in three siblings, helping to establish the core symptoms associated with SPTBN4 mutations.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Biallelic loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, and large deletions) are strongly associated with the NEDHND phenotype, characterized by congenital muscular hypotonia (HP:0008944), global developmental delay (HP:0001263), areflexia (HP:0001284), and auditory neuropathy (HP:0030043).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The combination of severe, congenital hypotonia (\"floppy baby\"), areflexia/neuropathy, and hearing impairment is highly suggestive of an SPTBN4-related disorder. Testing should be considered in patients with a non-5q spinal muscular atrophy-like phenotype.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The clinical presentation overlaps with other congenital myopathies, congenital muscular dystrophies, and other genetic causes of severe neonatal hypotonia and neuropathy. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a key differential diagnosis to exclude.\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in SPTBN4 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "SLC16A6": "SLC16A6 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: SLC16A6 (MCT6)**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:10926\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 603765\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While some databases associate the gene with broader categories, current evidence most strongly links *SLC16A6* variants to variation in human height as a quantitative trait locus. There is no definitive monogenic disease associated with this gene.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association with human height is based on population-level genetic studies. Its role in monogenic disease is not established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Not applicable for a monogenic disease context; variants contribute to a complex trait (height).\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI:** 0.00 (gnomAD v2.1.1)\n*   **LOEUF:** 1.13 (gnomAD v2.1.1)\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) is very low, and the loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is high. This indicates that the gene is highly tolerant of inactivating variants and is not under strong selection against heterozygous loss-of-function, making it an unlikely candidate for a haploinsufficient disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Currently, no specific variant classes are defined as pathogenic for a monogenic disease. Variants associated with height are found in non-coding (5'-UTR, intron 1) and coding (exon 5) regions.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No HPO terms are definitively associated with pathogenic variants in *SLC16A6* for a Mendelian disorder. The primary associated phenotype is a quantitative trait:\n    *   Tall stature (HP:0000098) - Inferred from population studies showing association with increased adult height.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are currently documented in clinical cases. Zebrafish models with loss-of-function mutations exhibit:\n    *   Hepatic steatosis (HP:0001397) - Observed in zebrafish larvae and adults under specific dietary conditions due to impaired ketone body export from the liver.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The association with height is measured in adults.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable in a monogenic disease context. The effect on height is a statistical contribution, not a spectrum of disease severity.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Loss-of-function in zebrafish models leads to increased body length. In humans, variants in the 5'-UTR, first intron, and a missense variant in the fifth exon are significantly associated with increased adult height.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No specific domain-phenotype correlations have been established.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between certain *SLC16A6* variants and human height is statistically significant in large population cohorts, but this does not represent a deterministic cause for a Mendelian disorder.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No well-characterized pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in *SLC16A6* are listed in ClinVar as causative for a monogenic disease. The gene's primary association is with the complex trait of height.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** Population genetics data suggest primary expression sites relevant to its phenotype are the liver, brain, and endocrine pancreas. The GTEx portal shows expression across many tissues, with notable levels in the testis, skeletal muscle, and heart.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Liver-specific dysfunction in zebrafish models causes hepatic steatosis due to an inability to export ketone bodies. The effect on height is likely regulated by its function in several tissues.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The role of expression during development has not been fully elucidated, but its impact on adult height suggests a role during growth periods.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *SLC16A6* encodes a proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter that moves substrates such as ketone bodies across the plasma membrane.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism appears to be related to loss-of-function. In zebrafish, complete loss of the protein promotes linear growth.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of ketone body metabolism is the primary known pathway effect. In zebrafish liver, impaired export of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate diverts ketogenic carbons into triacylglycerol synthesis, causing steatosis. The precise pathway linking monocarboxylate transport to human height is not yet understood.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Monocarboxylate transporters can require an ancillary protein, such as basigin, for proper localization and function.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Zero, as *SLC16A6* is not currently associated with a Mendelian disease for which clinical testing is performed.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is not common in a clinical diagnostic setting. It is primarily analyzed in a research context for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits like height.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counsel should emphasize that variants in this gene are considered modifiers of complex traits (like height) and are not known to cause a single-gene disorder. Distinguishing this from other *SLC16A* family members that do cause severe Mendelian diseases (e.g., *SLC16A2* and Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome) is critical.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 30692942, 2019:** Established the primary link between *SLC16A6* and adult height through studies in both zebrafish and humans, demonstrating that loss of function in zebrafish promotes increased length.\n*   **PMID: 32445851, 2020:** A bioinformatic analysis of the *SLC16A* family in pancreatic cancer found that *SLC16A6* was generally expressed at lower levels in tumors compared to normal tissues.\n*   **PMID: 29596541, 2018:** Described the function of related monocarboxylate transporters and the disease mechanisms associated with other members of the SLC16 family, providing context for the gene family.\n*   **NCBI Gene ID: 9120 (updated 2025):** The gene summary notes that genetic variants in *SLC16A6* of the ketone body metabolic pathway may predict cutaneous melanoma-specific survival.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** At present, the only association is between certain common and non-coding variants and the quantitative trait of increased adult height, which could be mapped inferentially to Tall stature (HP:0000098). There are no high-confidence associations for a monogenic disorder.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are no \"red flag\" HPO terms that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in *SLC16A6*. Its contribution to height is part of normal variation and not indicative of a syndromic overgrowth disorder.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Because there is no defined *SLC16A6*-related disease, it would not typically be part of a differential diagnosis. It is crucial to differentiate from other genes in the same family, such as *SLC16A1*, which causes recurrent ketoacidosis, and *SLC16A2*, which causes Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome characterized by severe psychomotor disability (Global developmental delay, HP:0001263; Generalized hypotonia, HP:0001290).\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in SLC16A6 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "CEP89": "CEP89 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 25907.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 615470.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Mitochondrial Complex IV Deficiency, Nuclear Type; Intellectual disability and multisystemic disorders.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for a role in disease is moderate, with some sources classifying it as \"Amber\" (moderate evidence) due to the limited number of reported cases. A homozygous deletion involving *CEP89* was identified in a patient with a complex phenotype, providing the primary evidence for its disease association.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The observed inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive, specifically biallelic loss-of-function.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI of 0.00, a LOEUF of 1.13, pRec of 0.81, and pNull of 0.19.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores suggest that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This indicates that haploinsufficiency is not a likely disease mechanism. The high pRec score suggests a higher probability of being associated with recessive disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Homozygous deletions or biallelic loss-of-function variants (e.g., nonsense, frameshift) are the most likely pathogenic variant classes, consistent with a recessive inheritance pattern.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Intellectual disability (HP:0001249).\n    *   Cytochrome-c oxidase deficiency (HP:0008347).\n    *   Cystinuria (HP:0003387).\n    *   Cataract (HP:0000518).\n    *   Deafness / Hearing impairment (HP:0000365).\n    *   Broad-based gait (HP:0002136).\n    *   Developmental delay.\n    *   Hypotonia (HP:0001252).\n    *   Muscle weakness (HP:0001324).\n    *   Hepatomegaly (HP:0002240).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Exercise intolerance (HP:0003546).\n    *   Delayed motor development.\n    *   Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HP:0001639).\n    *   Liver dysfunction.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Clinical features can be identified in childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype associated with biallelic *CEP89* deletion is severe, involving multisystemic and neurological problems.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** A homozygous deletion of *CEP89* (along with *SLC7A9*) was associated with a complex phenotype including intellectual disability, mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, cataracts, deafness, ataxia, and cystinuria. The cystinuria is attributed to the *SLC7A9* deletion, while the other features are likely due to the loss of *CEP89*.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The CEP89 protein contains coiled-coil domains and a potential mitochondrial-targeting signal. Disruption of these domains through variants is expected to impact its function in ciliogenesis and mitochondrial metabolism.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is currently based on a single well-documented case, making the strength moderate until additional cases are reported.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   As of now, the primary reported pathogenic event is a large homozygous deletion on chromosome 19q13.11, encompassing both *CEP89* and the adjacent *SLC7A9* gene. Specific pathogenic point variants or small indels in *CEP89* are not yet well-characterized in ClinVar with \"Pathogenic\" assertions.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, *CEP89* shows broad expression, with notable levels in the testis, cerebellum, and frontal cortex. Other sources mention expression in the nervous system, intestine, and blood.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its role in mitochondrial function and ciliogenesis, and its expression in the brain, dysfunction is expected to lead to neurological phenotypes like intellectual disability and ataxia. Expression in other tissues aligns with the observed multisystemic issues.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The gene is expressed in the fetal ventricular zone and ganglionic eminence, suggesting a role in brain development. This aligns with the developmental delay and intellectual disability phenotypes.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** CEP89 is required for ciliogenesis and also plays a role in mitochondrial metabolism, where it may modulate the activity of mitochondrial complex IV.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is loss-of-function, consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The homozygous deletion resulted in a lack of functional CEP89 protein.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of *CEP89* impairs the assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex IV, leading to decreased ATP production. This mitochondrial dysfunction underlies the neurological and muscular symptoms. Its role in ciliogenesis suggests that ciliary defects may also contribute to the pleiotropic phenotype.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** CEP89 localizes to the centrosome and colocalizes with the distal appendage protein CEP164, indicating a role in centriole and cilium structure. It is also found in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for *CEP89* variants is currently very low, as pathogenic variants have only been reported in a single case.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for *CEP89* would be considered in individuals presenting with a combination of intellectual disability, mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, and other features of the reported phenotype like cataracts, deafness, and ataxia, particularly if cystinuria is also present (suggesting a contiguous gene deletion).\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are currently no specific therapies targeting CEP89 deficiency. Management is supportive and focuses on the individual's symptoms, such as educational support for intellectual disability and monitoring of mitochondrial and organ function.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For parents of an affected individual, the recurrence risk for future pregnancies is 25%, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. Carrier testing for at-risk family members would be possible once the specific pathogenic variants are identified.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 23575228, 2013:** This landmark paper first described a patient with a homozygous deletion of *CEP89* and *SLC7A9*. It established the link between *CEP89* loss-of-function and a phenotype of isolated complex IV deficiency, intellectual disability, cataract, deafness, and ataxia. Using a *Drosophila* model, the study demonstrated that Cep89 is crucial for mitochondrial integrity, complex IV activity, and neuronal function.\n*   **PMID: 35029312, 2022:** This study investigated the role of *CEP89* in ovarian cancer, finding that increased copy number and expression are associated with a poor prognosis. While focused on oncology, it highlights the gene's role in cellular processes that can be relevant to both cancer and developmental disorders.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** A homozygous deletion of *CEP89* is strongly associated with a syndromic presentation including **Intellectual disability (HP:0001249)**, **Cytochrome-c oxidase deficiency (HP:0008347)**, **Cataract (HP:0000518)**, and **Hearing impairment (HP:0000365)**.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The co-occurrence of mitochondrial complex IV deficiency with intellectual disability and the specific constellation of cataracts, deafness, and ataxia should raise strong suspicion for *CEP89* defects, especially if accompanied by cystinuria (which points to a contiguous gene deletion with *SLC7A9*).\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype overlaps with other mitochondrial disorders caused by defects in complex IV assembly factors or other genes involved in mitochondrial function. It also shares features with ciliopathies, given the gene's role in ciliogenesis. Therefore, genes associated with Leigh syndrome, other complex IV deficiencies, and syndromic ciliopathies should be considered.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in CEP89 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "KLRC2": "KLRC2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n- **HGNC ID:** 6375\n- **OMIM Gene ID:** 602891\n- **Primary Disease Associations:** While not linked to a Mendelian disease, KLRC2 variation, particularly gene deletion, is associated with susceptibility to and severity of viral infections, including Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and severe COVID-19. It has also been investigated in the context of psoriasis and HIV, with some studies suggesting an association.\n- **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of KLRC2 variants is currently considered associative, influencing susceptibility and response to infectious diseases rather than causing a monogenic disorder.\n- **Inheritance Patterns:** The KLRC2 gene can be deleted in a heterozygous or homozygous state, which is a common polymorphism in the general population. The deletion allele frequency varies across different populations.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n- **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) of 0.00, an observed/expected (o/e) LoF upper bound fraction (LOEUF) of 1.13, a pRec of 0.61, and a pNull of 0.39.\n- **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The very low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that the KLRC2 gene is highly tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. This is consistent with the observation that homozygous deletion of KLRC2 is found in healthy individuals. These scores suggest that LoF variants are not expected to cause a severe Mendelian disease.\n- **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to LoF, pathogenic variants are less likely to be simple null alleles. However, variants affecting the protein's function, such as missense or in-frame deletions that alter interactions with other proteins like KLRD1 (CD94), could have clinical consequences related to immune response.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n- **Primary HPO terms:** As KLRC2 is not associated with a Mendelian disorder, a standard HPO-based phenotype spectrum is not applicable. Phenotypes are primarily related to altered immune function.\n- **Secondary HPO terms:** Phenotypic consequences relate to \"Increased susceptibility to viral infections.\"\n- **Age of Onset Patterns:** The impact of KLRC2 variants, such as the deletion, can become apparent at any age upon exposure to specific viral pathogens like HCMV or SARS-CoV-2.\n- **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity associated with KLRC2 deletion ranges from no clinical phenotype to increased severity of viral infections, such as severe COVID-19.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n- **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous or heterozygous deletion of the KLRC2 gene is the most studied variation. This deletion is associated with an altered adaptive Natural Killer (NK) cell response and can lead to poorer control of viral infections.\n- **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The KLRC2 protein forms a heterodimer with KLRD1 (CD94) to recognize HLA-E molecules on target cells. Variants disrupting the C-type lectin domain or the interaction with KLRD1 would be expected to impair NK cell activation.\n- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between KLRC2 deletion and susceptibility to severe viral infections is considered moderate, as it is a risk factor rather than a deterministic cause. The presence of the deletion has been linked to lower counts of adaptive NK cells.\n- **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** The 16-kb deletion of the KLRC2 gene is associated with the absence of the NKG2C receptor on the cell surface in homozygous individuals, leading to a diminished adaptive NK cell response to HCMV.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n- Characterization of pathogenic single nucleotide variants or small indels is limited, as the most significant known variation is the whole gene deletion.\n- **KLRC2 gene deletion (del/del):** Associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 and impaired control of HCMV infection. Allele frequency is variable across populations.\n- **KLRC2 gene deletion (wt/del):** Heterozygous carriers may have a reduced number of adaptive NK cells compared to wild-type individuals.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** KLRC2 shows the highest expression in whole blood.\n- **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its primary expression in NK cells and some T-cell subsets, phenotypes are expected to be confined to the immune system, specifically affecting anti-viral and anti-tumor surveillance.\n- **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression is tied to the maturation and activation of NK cells. The consequences of KLRC2 variation can manifest throughout life, particularly in response to infections that trigger adaptive NK cell responses.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal Gene Function:** The KLRC2 gene encodes the NKG2C protein, an activating receptor on NK cells and some cytotoxic T-cells that recognizes HLA-E molecules on target cells, playing a role in the immune response to viral infections and cellular stress.\n- **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism associated with clinical phenotypes is loss of function due to gene deletion, leading to an impaired or absent adaptive NK cell response. This can be considered a form of haploinsufficiency in heterozygotes, though the clinical impact is variable.\n- **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the Natural Killer cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway (KEGG: hsa04650) and DAP12 signaling impairs the ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate virally infected cells, leading to increased susceptibility and severity of infections.\n- **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction between KLRC2 (NKG2C) and KLRD1 (CD94) is essential for forming the functional receptor. This receptor complex then interacts with TYROBP (DAP12) for signal transduction. Disruption of these interactions prevents the activation of NK cells.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n- **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for KLRC2 is generally not performed for diagnostic purposes of a specific disease but rather in research settings to assess immune function or risk for severe infections.\n- **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is primarily done to investigate the immune response to viral infections like HCMV, HIV, or SARS-CoV-2, and in the context of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n- **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Knowledge of KLRC2 deletion status could potentially inform risk stratification for patients with certain viral infections, although this is not yet standard clinical practice.\n- **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling would involve explaining that the KLRC2 deletion is a common polymorphism with variable penetrance for infection susceptibility and does not cause a classic Mendelian disease.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- **PMID: 35018659, 2022:** Reported that KLRC2 deletion was associated with significantly lower adaptive NK cells and tended to be associated with CMV viremia in patients with severe COVID-19.\n- **PMID: 27311985, 2016:** Found that the frequency of homozygous KLRC2 deletion varies significantly between African populations but found no association with trachoma.\n- **PMID: 27508088, 2016:** Describes molecular genetic analyses for detecting KLRC2 gene deletion and discusses its association with various diseases, including HIV and psoriasis.\n- **PMID: 31215112, 2019:** Reports a new KLRC2 allele (NKG2C*03) and highlights the presence of both complete gene deletions and sequence polymorphism in the population.\n- **PMID: 38454238, 2024:** A recent study showing that KLRC2 expression in glioblastoma tumor cells is associated with a better response to immunotherapy (PD-1 blockade).\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n- **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** No high-confidence HPO-variant associations exist in the traditional sense for a Mendelian disease. The primary association is between the KLRC2 gene deletion and increased susceptibility to severe viral infections.\n- **Phenotype red flags:** A history of severe or recurrent HCMV infection, or severe COVID-19, particularly in the context of CMV reactivation, could suggest that investigating the KLRC2 deletion status may be relevant.\n- **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The clinical picture of immunodeficiency associated with KLRC2 deletion overlaps with other primary and secondary immunodeficiencies affecting NK cell function. Therefore, a broader immunological workup would be necessary.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in KLRC2 (1/1):\nN/A.

However, given its function as a component of the nuclear pore complex, phenotypes could theoretically involve a wide range of systems.\n- **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are specifically linked to *POM121C* variants in the literature.\n- **Age of Onset Patterns:** The age of onset for any potential *POM121C*-related disorder is currently unknown.\n- **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The spectrum of severity for phenotypes associated with *POM121C* has not been characterized.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n- **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** There are no established correlations between specific variant classes in *POM121C* and particular phenotypes.\n- **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The relationship between variants in specific domains of the POM121C protein and clinical phenotypes is not known.\n- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlations for *POM121C* is currently undefined.\n- **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** There are no documented examples of specific *POM121C* variants leading to distinct phenotypes.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n- No pathogenic variants in *POM121C* with clear phenotype associations are reported in ClinVar.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to the Human Protein Atlas, which incorporates GTEx data, *POM121C* shows expression in a wide range of tissues, with higher levels noted in the testis, adrenal gland, and liver.\n- **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given the broad expression, pathogenic variants could potentially lead to systemic effects or manifest in tissues with the highest expression levels. For example, some studies have explored its role in adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity.\n- **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Information regarding the developmental expression of *POM121C* and its link to age-related phenotypes is limited.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal Gene Function:** *POM121C* is an essential component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which mediates the transport of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.\n- **Disease Mechanism:** The potential disease mechanisms for *POM121C* variants (haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative, or gain-of-function) have not been determined.\n- **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** As part of the NPC, pathogenic variants in *POM121C* would likely disrupt nucleocytoplasmic transport, which could have widespread cellular consequences. Some research suggests a role for *POM121C* in regulating the transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b3, which is involved in metabolism and cell proliferation.\n- **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** POM121C interacts with various other nucleoporins to form the NPC. It has also been shown to interact with importin \u03b2, a key component of the nuclear import machinery.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n- **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield of sequencing *POM121C* in clinical cohorts is unknown, as it is not currently a recognized disease-causing gene.\n- **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for *POM121C* is not a standard clinical practice.\n- **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There is no information on the clinical actionability or management implications related to *POM121C* variants.\n- **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Due to the lack of established disease association, genetic counseling for *POM121C* variants would be challenging and focus on the uncertainty of the findings.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- **PMID: 17900573, Year: 2007:** This study identified two distinct human POM121 genes (*POM121* and *POM121C*) and suggested their requirement for the formation of nuclear pore complexes.\n- **PMID: 38177583, Year: 2024:** Research indicated that overexpression of *POM121* is associated with unfavorable outcomes in colorectal cancer and that it regulates the subcellular localization and transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b3.\n- **PMID: 32675796, Year: 2020:** A study on lethal prostate cancer showed that *POM121* upregulation was linked to tumor progression by increasing the nuclear import of oncogenic transcription factors like MYC and E2F1.\n- **PMID: 32986877, Year: 2020:** This publication discusses the role of *POM121* in laryngeal cancer, suggesting it as a potential prognostic marker.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n- **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** There are currently no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for *POM121C*.\n- **Phenotype red flags:** No specific HPO terms are considered \"red flags\" that would strongly suggest pathogenic variants in *POM121C*.\n- **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Given its function, hypothetical disorders related to *POM121C* might have overlapping phenotypes with other nucleoporinopathies, which are a group of diseases caused by defects in the nuclear pore complex.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in POM121C (1/1):\nN/A.

        "PARP4": "PARP4 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: PARP4**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:8624\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 607519\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Currently, PARP4 is not definitively associated with a Mendelian disease; however, it is implicated as a candidate gene in cancer susceptibility, with variants and expression changes noted in breast, thyroid, lung, ovarian, and colon cancers.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for a role in cancer susceptibility is emerging and would be considered limited or moderate; there is no established clinical significance for a monogenic Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** The role of germline variants in cancer susceptibility is under investigation, with some rare variants observed in case-control studies. A clear inheritance pattern has not been established.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    *   pLI (probability of being Loss-of-function Intolerant): 0.00\n    *   LOEUF (Loss-of-function Observed/Expected Upper bound Fraction): 0.786\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The pLI score of 0.0 and a LOEUF score of 0.786 indicate that PARP4 is not significantly constrained against loss-of-function (LoF) variants in the general population. This suggests the gene is tolerant of heterozygous LoF variants, and haploinsufficiency is not a likely disease mechanism.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While the gene is tolerant to LoF variation overall, specific missense variants (e.g., I1039T) have been shown to have a loss-of-function effect and promote tumorigenicity in somatic contexts. The role of germline variants is still being elucidated, with some studies pointing to rare missense variants being associated with cancer risk.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are definitively associated with germline PARP4 variants. The primary phenotype is predisposition to or modulation of cancer.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Not applicable due to the lack of an associated Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not defined for a Mendelian disease; in cancer, its role is studied in the context of adult-onset malignancies.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** In cancer studies, low PARP4 expression or specific mutations are associated with poorer prognosis and more aggressive disease in some cancer types, such as breast and esophageal cancer.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Loss-of-function:** PARP4 deficiency in mouse models leads to increased susceptibility to carcinogen-induced colon tumors. The somatic I1039T mutation in lung cancer acts as a LoF variant, promoting tumorigenicity.\n    *   **Missense:** Germline missense variants G496V and T1170I were found at a higher frequency in individuals with primary thyroid and breast cancers.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The I1039T mutation, which may destabilize the protein, is associated with a loss-of-function phenotype in lung cancer. The protein has a PARP catalytic domain, but its activity may be regulated by protein-protein interactions via its C-terminus rather than direct DNA binding.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Weak. While some variants and expression levels are associated with cancer risk and prognosis, the evidence is not yet strong enough to establish definitive correlations for clinical prediction.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   Currently, ClinVar lists no variants for PARP4 with a \"Pathogenic\" or \"Likely Pathogenic\" classification for a Mendelian disorder. Numerous variants of uncertain significance are listed.\n*   **Variants from Literature:**\n    *   **HGVS: c.1487G>T / p.Gly496Val:** Reported in individuals with primary thyroid and breast cancers.\n    *   **HGVS: c.3508A>A/T / p.Thr1170Ile:** Found in individuals with primary thyroid and breast cancers.\n    *   **HGVS: c.3115T>A / p.Ile1039T:** A recurrent somatic mutation in lung adenocarcinoma, associated with increased tumorigenicity and considered a loss-of-function variant.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to the Human Protein Atlas, which incorporates GTEx data, PARP4 shows highest RNA expression in the rectum, duodenum, monocyte, gallbladder, and bone marrow.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The role of PARP4 as a potential tumor suppressor appears to be cancer-type dependent, with effects observed in colon and lung cancer models. Its expression level has prognostic significance in ovarian, breast, and esophageal cancer.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Information on developmental expression is limited. Current data relates to its role in adult-onset diseases (cancers).\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** PARP4 encodes an enzyme that catalyzes poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and is involved in cellular processes such as DNA repair and inflammatory response.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** In cancer, the primary proposed mechanism is loss-of-function, acting as a tumor suppressor. However, in some cancers like ovarian, high expression is linked to chemoresistance and poor prognosis, suggesting a context-dependent role.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Splicing Regulation:** PARP4 interacts with the splicing regulator hnRNPM; disruption of this interaction perturbs splicing and promotes tumorigenicity in lung cancer, independent of its role in the vault complex.\n    *   **DNA Repair/Chemoresistance:** While thought to be involved in base excision repair, direct evidence is lacking. Its expression is linked to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, potentially through epigenetic mechanisms regulating its promoter.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Zero for Mendelian disorders. For cancer predisposition, its utility is currently investigational and not part of standard clinical testing panels.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is currently performed in a research context to investigate cancer susceptibility or for prognostic studies in specific cancers.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present. There are no specific management guidelines based on PARP4 genotype.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the tolerant gnomAD constraint scores and lack of definitive disease association, caution is warranted when interpreting rare PARP4 variants. An incidental finding of a rare variant would likely be classified as a VUS.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 37013346 (2023):** Showed that PARP4 expression is upregulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines and patient tissues due to promoter hypomethylation, suggesting it as a biomarker for chemoresistance.\n*   **PMID: 35198822 (2022):** Identified germline PARP4 variants (G496V, T1170I) at a higher frequency in patients with both primary thyroid and breast cancers, suggesting it as a candidate susceptibility gene.\n*   **(2024):** A study on lung adenocarcinoma revealed that PARP4 loss or mutation (I1039T) promotes tumorigenicity by disrupting splicing through its interaction with hnRNPM, a mechanism independent of the vault complex.\n*   **PMID: 34151756 (2021):** A review summarizing the role of PARP family members in cancer, noting low PARP4 expression is correlated with poor survival in breast cancer and high expression with poor survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n*   **PMID: 37013346 (2023):** Demonstrated that depletion of PARP4 in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells reduces chemoresistance and enhances DNA fragmentation.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** None established. The gene is not currently linked to a specific Mendelian syndrome with a defined set of HPO terms.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are no \"red flag\" HPO terms. A clinical history of multiple primary tumors (e.g., breast and thyroid) could be a suggestive feature for investigating candidate genes like PARP4 in a research setting.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** In a patient with a potential cancer predisposition syndrome, differential diagnoses would include more well-established cancer predisposition genes associated with the specific tumor types observed (e.g., BRCA1/2, PTEN, TP53).\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PARP4 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "CHRNA7": "CHRNA7 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: CHRNA7**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 1960.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 118511.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (OMIM #612001) is the primary disease associated with alterations in *CHRNA7*. The gene is also implicated in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The role of *CHRNA7* deletion in the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome phenotype is well-established. However, the pathogenicity of duplications is less certain due to variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, though many cases arise *de novo*. Duplications are more frequently inherited from an unaffected parent, complicating clinical interpretation.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Based on gnomAD v2.1.1, *CHRNA7* has a probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score of 0.00, indicating it is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction (LOEUF) score is 1.08. The gene is not predicted to be associated with recessive disease (pRec = 0.02).\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores suggest that heterozygous loss-of-function point mutations within the general population are tolerated and that haploinsufficiency from sequence variants is not a common disease mechanism. This contrasts with the known pathogenicity of whole-gene deletions via CNV.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Copy number variations (CNVs), specifically microdeletions encompassing the entire gene, are the primary pathogenic variant class. The role of individual missense or nonsense variants is less clear, though rare promoter variants that reduce transcription have been noted in ASD cases.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Intellectual disability (HP:0001249).\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0100711).\n    *   Hypotonia (HP:0001252).\n    *   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (HP:0007018).\n    *   Schizophrenia (HP:0100753).\n    *   Developmental regression (HP:0002376).\n    *   Motor delay (HP:0001270).\n    *   Anxiety (HP:0000739).\n    *   Aggressive behavior (HP:0100718).\n    *   Short stature (HP:0004322).\n    *   Mood disorders (HP:0000708).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Obsessive-compulsive behavior (HP:0000722).\n    *   Bipolar disorder (HP:0007302).\n    *   Tourette syndrome (HP:0001282).\n    *   Abnormality of brain morphology (HP:0002011).\n    *   Dyslexia (HP:0002336).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes are typically identified in childhood due to the presentation of developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. Neuropsychiatric features like schizophrenia may manifest in adolescence or early adulthood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The clinical presentation is highly variable. Deletions generally cause more severe and highly penetrant phenotypes compared to duplications. Individuals with zero to four copies of *CHRNA7* have been reported, showing a range of clinical severity.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Deletions (Haploinsufficiency):** Heterozygous deletions are strongly associated with intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delay (15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome).\n    *   **Duplications:** Associated with a wider, more variable spectrum of neuropsychiatric phenotypes including ASD, ADHD, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. Penetrance is incomplete and expressivity is highly variable.\n    *   **Triplications:** A three-generation family with *CHRNA7* triplication displayed various neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including anxiety, bipolar disorder, and developmental delay, providing further evidence for dosage sensitivity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between 15q13.3 microdeletions and a core phenotype of ID, epilepsy, and developmental delay is strong. The correlation for duplications and neuropsychiatric disorders is considered moderate due to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** The phenotype is primarily linked to copy number of the entire gene rather than specific intragenic variants. The 1.5 Mb deletion at 15q13.3 (Type 1) is the recurrent CNV encompassing *CHRNA7* that causes the associated syndrome.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\nGiven that the primary pathogenic mechanism is CNV, a list of single nucleotide variants is not the most clinically relevant representation. The critical pathogenic variant is the recurrent microdeletion at chromosome 15q13.3.\n*   **Variant:** nsv469778 (representative of the 1.5 Mb 15q13.3 microdeletion).\n*   **Type:** Copy number loss / deletion.\n*   **ClinVar Significance:** Pathogenic.\n*   **Reported Phenotypes:** Intellectual disability (HP:0001249), Seizures (HP:0001250), Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750), Hypotonia (HP:0001252), Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0100711).\n*   **AF:** Frequency in the general population is low, but it is one of the more common pathogenic CNVs.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, *CHRNA7* shows notable expression in the brain (especially cerebellum), adrenal gland, and pituitary gland. It is also expressed in the lung, spleen, and skin.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the brain, particularly the hippocampus, aligns with the observed neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric phenotypes like cognitive deficits, seizures, learning, and memory problems. Expression in immune cells is relevant to its role in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The gene is critical during neurodevelopment, which explains the childhood onset of many associated phenotypes. Its ongoing role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release throughout life contributes to the manifestation of psychiatric disorders in adolescence and adulthood.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The *CHRNA7* gene encodes the alpha-7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17-nAChR), a ligand-gated ion channel that, upon binding acetylcholine, opens to allow the influx of cations, including a high permeability to calcium.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:**\n    *   **Haploinsufficiency:** Deletion of one copy of *CHRNA7* leads to a reduced dosage of the \u03b17-nAChR protein, which is the primary mechanism for 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome.\n    *   **Gene Dosage Effect:** Both deletions and duplications/triplications result in altered gene dosage, demonstrating that the human brain is highly sensitive to the amount of *CHRNA7* product. Unexpectedly, both deletions and duplications have been shown to lead to decreased \u03b17-nAChR-associated calcium flux in cellular models.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of *CHRNA7* impacts cholinergic synaptic transmission and calcium signaling. This impairs neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal excitability, leading to cognitive deficits (learning/memory), seizures, and behavioral abnormalities. The gene is also a key component of the \"cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway,\" which modulates systemic inflammation.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The partially duplicated gene *CHRFAM7A* can form a hybrid transcript that acts as a dominant-negative regulator of \u03b17-nAChR function, reducing the number of functional receptors and potentially modifying the phenotype.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Deletions of *CHRNA7* are found in approximately 1% of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies. The 15q13.3 microdeletion is a recurrent finding in cohorts of individuals with intellectual disability, ASD, and schizophrenia.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for *CHRNA7* CNVs (via chromosomal microarray) is indicated for patients with unexplained intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, autism spectrum disorder, or schizophrenia.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identification of a pathogenic *CHRNA7* CNV confirms a genetic diagnosis, allowing for anticipatory guidance and management of associated features like seizures and developmental delays. It can also inform prognosis and family planning.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the concepts of autosomal dominant inheritance, *de novo* occurrence, incomplete penetrance, and variable expressivity, particularly for duplications. The possibility of an unaffected carrier parent must be discussed.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Sharp, A.J. et al. (2008). *Nat Genet*.

(2017). *J Neurodev Disord*. PMID: 28932289.** This study detailed the clinical and behavioral phenotypes of 18 children with *CHRNA7* duplications, emphasizing the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance.\n*   **Masi, A. et al. (2015). *Am J Med Genet B*. PMID: 25656121.** This was the first study to perform sequence variant analysis of *CHRNA7* in an ASD cohort, highlighting the technical challenges due to the *CHRFAM7A* fusion gene and identifying rare, functional promoter variants.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   A heterozygous microdeletion of *CHRNA7* is strongly associated with a core phenotype of Intellectual disability (HP:0001249), Seizures (HP:0001250), and Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   A heterozygous microduplication of *CHRNA7* is associated with a broader, more variable phenotype that includes Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0100711), ADHD (HP:0007018), and Schizophrenia (HP:0100753), but with incomplete penetrance.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of intellectual disability, early-onset seizures (especially idiopathic generalized epilepsy), and features of ASD should strongly suggest testing for a 15q13.3 CNV involving *CHRNA7*.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome overlaps with other genomic disorders and epilepsy syndromes. The broad neuropsychiatric phenotypes seen with *CHRNA7* duplications overlap with numerous other genetic and multifactorial conditions.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in CHRNA7 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "RGPD3": "RGPD3 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n\u2013 **HGNC ID:** 32416\n\u2013 **OMIM Gene ID:** 612706\n\u2013 **Primary Disease Associations:** While some databases list associations with conditions like Sphenoorbital Meningioma and Cerebellopontine Angle Meningioma, these appear to be text-mining-based associations and there is currently no definitive, published evidence linking RGPD3 to a specific Mendelian disease.\n\u2013 **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of RGPD3 is not yet definitively established.\n\u2013 **Inheritance Patterns:** No clear inheritance pattern has been described in relation to a specific disease phenotype.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\u2013 **pLI:** The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score for RGPD3 is not prominently high, suggesting it is not under strong selection against loss-of-function variants. A high pLI (typically \u22650.9) indicates a gene is intolerant to protein-truncating variants.\n\u2013 **LOEUF:** The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) score provides a more continuous measure of intolerance. A low LOEUF score indicates intolerance to loss-of-function variation. Specific values for RGPD3 require direct database lookup.\n\u2013 **pRec, pNull:** These gnomAD metrics represent the probability of being intolerant to homozygous loss-of-function variants (pRec) and the probability of being tolerant to both heterozygous and homozygous LoF variants (pNull). Specific values for RGPD3 are needed for interpretation.\n\u2013 **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The available constraint metrics for RGPD3 do not strongly suggest it is a classic haploinsufficient disease gene.\n\u2013 **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Without a clear disease association, it is difficult to determine which variant classes are most likely to be pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\nAs RGPD3 is not yet definitively linked to a human disease, a formal phenotype spectrum based on clinical cases is not available. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a standardized vocabulary used to describe phenotypic abnormalities in human disease.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\nThere are no established genotype-phenotype correlations for RGPD3 at this time due to the lack of a confirmed disease association.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\nClinVar, a public archive of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, does not currently list pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in RGPD3 with a clear, consistent clinical phenotype.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\u2013 **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, RGPD3 shows broad expression, with the highest levels observed in the testis and thyroid.\n\u2013 **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Based on expression data, pathogenic variants could theoretically lead to phenotypes related to testicular or thyroid function, though this is speculative.\n\u2013 **Expression During Development:** Expression patterns during fetal development have been noted, which could imply a role in developmental processes.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\u2013 **Normal Gene Function:** The RGPD3 protein is predicted to be involved in the import of NLS-bearing proteins into the nucleus and is thought to be a component of the nuclear pore complex.\n\u2013 **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism of disease, should one be established, is currently unknown.\n\u2013 **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** The gene is associated with the RNA transport pathway. Disruption of this pathway could lead to a variety of cellular dysfunctions. The encoded protein contains a TPR domain, two Ran-binding domains, and a C-terminal GRIP domain.\n\u2013 **Protein-Protein Interactions:** As a Ran-binding protein, RGPD3 likely interacts with components of the nuclear transport machinery.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\u2013 **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for RGPD3 in clinical exome/genome sequencing is currently zero, as it is not a recognized disease gene.\n\u2013 **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** This gene would typically be sequenced as part of a larger panel or exome/genome sequencing, not as a targeted test.\n\u2013 **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are no specific clinical management guidelines related to variants in RGPD3.\n\u2013 **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling would be based on the lack of evidence for pathogenicity for variants of uncertain significance found in this gene.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\nThere are no key clinical papers that have established a definitive link between variants in RGPD3 and a human phenotype. Existing literature focuses on its genomic location, evolution, and predicted function based on its protein domains.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\u2013 **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** None established.\n\u2013 **Phenotype red flags:** None established.\n\u2013 **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Not applicable at this time.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in RGPD3 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "NUTM2D": "NUTM2D Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID, OMIM gene ID, primary disease associations**:\n    *   HGNC ID: 23447.\n    *   OMIM gene ID: There is currently no OMIM entry specifically for the NUTM2D gene.\n    *   Primary disease associations: Text mining has associated NUTM2D with Retinitis Pigmentosa.\n\n*   **Clinical significance level**: The clinical significance of NUTM2D is not yet definitively established due to a lack of extensive research and clinical case reports directly linking it to a specific Mendelian disorder.\n\n*   **Inheritance patterns observed in patients**: As there are no well-documented cases of Mendelian disease caused by NUTM2D variants, the inheritance patterns are unknown.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull (report exact numeric values)**:\n    *   As of recent gnomAD releases, specific constraint metrics like pLI and LOEUF are not available for NUTM2D.\n\n*   **Clinical interpretation of constraint scores**: The absence of constraint scores from gnomAD suggests that there is not enough data to confidently assess the gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variants. Generally, a pLI score \u2265 0.9 indicates a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function mutations. A low LOEUF score also indicates intolerance.\n\n*   **Variant classes most likely to be pathogenic**: Without established disease associations, the variant classes most likely to be pathogenic are unknown. For genes where haploinsufficiency is the mechanism, loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site mutations) are typically pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**:\n    *   There are no established HPO terms directly linked to NUTM2D in major databases like OMIM or ClinVar. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for clinical abnormalities.\n\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**:\n    *   No secondary HPO terms are currently documented for NUTM2D.\n\n*   **Age of onset patterns**: Information regarding the age of onset is not available.\n\n*   **Phenotype severity spectrum**: The spectrum of phenotype severity is unknown.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant classes and their typical phenotypes**: Due to the lack of identified pathogenic variants and associated clinical cases, there are no established correlations between variant classes and specific phenotypes for NUTM2D.\n\n*   **Protein domain-specific phenotype patterns**: The NUTM2D protein contains a NUT (Nuclear Testis-Specific) domain. However, no phenotype patterns have been linked to variants within this or any other domain of the protein.\n\n*   **Genotype-phenotype correlation strength**: The strength of any genotype-phenotype correlation for NUTM2D is currently unknown.\n\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes**: There are no documented examples of specific NUTM2D variants leading to particular phenotypes.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   At present, there are no well-characterized pathogenic variants in NUTM2D with confirmed associations to specific phenotypes in ClinVar or other major databases.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest expressing tissues (GTEx TPM) and clinical correlation**:\n    *   NUTM2D shows ubiquitous expression, with the highest levels observed in the testis and brain. It is also expressed in various other tissues, including adrenal gland, muscle, pancreas, and stomach.\n    *   Expression has been noted in fetal tissues between 10 and 20 weeks of gestation.\n\n*   **Tissue-specific phenotypes expected**: Given its expression in the brain and retina, neurological or ophthalmological phenotypes could be anticipated if variants in this gene are found to be pathogenic. The association with Retinitis Pigmentosa from text-mining supports this.\n\n*   **Expression during development and age-related phenotypes**: Expression in fetal tissues suggests a potential role in development.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal gene function in one sentence**: NUTM2D is a protein-coding gene, but its specific function is not well-characterized.\n\n*   **Disease mechanism**: The potential disease mechanism (e.g., haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative, gain-of-function) is currently unknown.\n\n*   **Cellular/molecular pathways disrupted \u2192 phenotype consequences**: The cellular and molecular pathways involving NUTM2D have not been fully elucidated, and thus the consequences of their disruption are not known.\n\n*   **Protein-protein interactions relevant to phenotype**: While interaction databases exist, specific protein-protein interactions for NUTM2D that are relevant to a human phenotype have not been established.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic yield in clinical cohorts**: The diagnostic yield for NUTM2D is unknown as it is not typically included in standard clinical testing panels for specific disorders.\n\n*   **Most common reasons for testing this gene**: Currently, there are no common clinical indications for testing the NUTM2D gene.\n\n*   **Clinical actionability and management implications**: There is no information on clinical actionability or management related to NUTM2D variants.\n\n*   **Genetic counseling considerations**: Without known disease associations or inheritance patterns, specific genetic counseling considerations for NUTM2D cannot be formulated.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   Currently, there are no landmark clinical studies that have established a definitive link between NUTM2D variants and a human phenotype. Existing literature primarily consists of large-scale genomic studies and database entries.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: At this time, there are no high-confidence associations between HPO terms and NUTM2D variants.\n\n*   **Phenotype red flags**: There are currently no \"red flag\" HPO terms that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in NUTM2D.\n\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**: Given the text-mined association with Retinitis Pigmentosa, other genes known to cause this condition would be part of a differential diagnosis. Its paralog, NUTM2A, has been associated with sarcomas, but it is unknown if NUTM2D plays a role in similar conditions.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in NUTM2D (1/1):\nN/A.

        "NUTM2A": "NUTM2A Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: NUTM2A**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 23438.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** Data not found in search results.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Primarily associated with cancers through gene fusion events, including Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma and a variant of CIC-rearranged sarcoma.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence is currently centered on somatic fusion events in cancer; significance for germline disease is not well established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Not applicable in the context of somatic fusions; germline inheritance patterns have not been described.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Specific constraint scores for NUTM2A were not found in the search results. General information defines pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) scores close to 1 as indicating intolerance to protein-truncating variants. The LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) is a newer metric where lower values indicate intolerance.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** High pLI (\u22650.9) or low LOEUF scores suggest a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation and may be associated with dominant diseases or haploinsufficiency. The absence of specific scores for NUTM2A prevents a direct interpretation for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** In the context of its known disease association, the pathogenic variants are gene fusions (e.g., NUTM2A-CIC, YWHAE-NUTM2A), a type of structural variation. Information on the pathogenicity of germline nonsense, missense, or splice variants is not available.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As NUTM2A's primary association is with somatic cancers, a typical HPO phenotype spectrum for a Mendelian disorder is not established. Associated phenotypes are related to the cancer type.\n    *   Sarcoma (HP:0002856)\n    *   Endometrial stromal sarcoma (HP:0030146)\n    *   Undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Data not available.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The reported case of NUTM2A-CIC fusion sarcoma occurred in a 43-year-old woman. Endometrial stromal sarcomas involving YWHAE-NUTM2A fusions occur in adults.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Sarcomas involving NUTM2A fusions are described as clinically aggressive with a poor prognosis and potential for fatal outcomes.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Gene Fusions:** Specific fusions involving NUTM2A are linked to distinct cancer types. The YWHAE-NUTM2A fusion is characteristic of a high-grade subtype of endometrial stromal sarcoma. The NUTM2A-CIC fusion defines a genetically distinct variant of CIC-rearranged small round cell sarcoma.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Data not available.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Strong. Specific somatic fusion events are defining features of particular aggressive sarcomas.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   **YWHAE-NUTM2A/B fusion \u2192** High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma.\n    *   **NUTM2A exon 7-CIC exon 12 fusion \u2192** Aggressive, undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   The primary pathogenic variants are somatic gene fusions, not germline variants with rsIDs.\n    *   **HGVS:** NUTM2A-CIC fusion.\n    *   **ClinVar Significance:** Not applicable (somatic).\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma.\n    *   **AF:** Not applicable (somatic).\n*   The primary pathogenic variants are somatic gene fusions, not germline variants with rsIDs.\n    *   **HGVS:** YWHAE-NUTM2A fusion.\n    *   **ClinVar Significance:** Not applicable (somatic).\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma.\n    *   **AF:** Not applicable (somatic).\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** GTEx data indicates expression in various tissues, including the thyroid, esophagus mucosa, and tibial nerve. The relevance of this expression pattern to the development of sarcomas in other tissues is unclear.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The known phenotypes are tissue-specific cancers: endometrial stromal sarcoma arises in the uterus, and other sarcomas can arise in soft tissues.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Data not available.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The precise function of the NUTM2A protein is not well-described in the search results.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is gain-of-function resulting from the creation of a chimeric oncogene fusion protein (e.g., NUTM2A-CIC, YWHAE-NUTM2A).\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The NUTM2A-CIC fusion protein is considered an oncogene protein that drives the proliferation of undifferentiated small round tumor cells, leading to a clinically aggressive sarcoma. YWHAE-NUTM2A fusions are associated with high-grade tumors and may involve pathways related to cyclin D1.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The fusion of NUTM2A with proteins like CIC or YWHAE creates the pathogenic driver of the associated cancers.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for NUTM2A fusions is relevant for the differential diagnosis of specific sarcoma subtypes. For instance, an NGS-based assay demonstrated good sensitivity for detecting endometrial stromal sarcoma fusion transcripts.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is performed on tumor tissue to identify diagnostic and prognostic genetic markers in undifferentiated sarcomas or suspected high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identifying a NUTM2A fusion can confirm a specific sarcoma diagnosis, which carries prognostic weight as these tumors are often aggressive. This information can guide treatment decisions, although specific targeted therapies were not detailed in the search results.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** As the known pathogenic variants are somatic, genetic counseling would focus on explaining the nature of the acquired genetic change in the tumor and the non-hereditary basis of the disease.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 28188754, 2017:** Described a novel NUTM2A-CIC fusion in a 43-year-old woman, defining a genetically distinct and aggressive variant of CIC-rearranged small round cell sarcoma.\n*   **PMID: 22456610, 2012:** Characterized the clinicopathologic features of endometrial stromal sarcomas with YWHAE-NUTM2A/B fusions, establishing them as histologically high-grade and clinically aggressive tumors.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   A **NUTM2A-CIC gene fusion** in tumor tissue is strongly associated with the phenotype of **undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma (HP:0030146)**.\n    *   A **YWHAE-NUTM2A gene fusion** in tumor tissue is strongly associated with **high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma**.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:**\n    *   The presence of an **undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma**, particularly one negative for other common fusion markers like ETV4, should raise suspicion for a CIC-related fusion, including NUTM2A-CIC.\n    *   A diagnosis of **endometrial stromal sarcoma** with high-grade, round-cell morphology is a strong indicator to test for a YWHAE-NUTM2A fusion.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma overlaps with other sarcomas driven by different gene fusions. Therefore, molecular testing is essential to differentiate NUTM2A-CIC sarcoma from other entities within the \"CIC-rearranged sarcoma\" category.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in NUTM2A (1/1):\nN/A.

However, research has identified hypermethylation of *RASA4* in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), correlating with a poorer prognosis.\n- **Clinical Significance Level**: The clinical significance of *RASA4* variants is still being established; there is currently no consensus on a definitive disease association.\n- **Inheritance Patterns**: Given the lack of a defined Mendelian disease, inheritance patterns are not yet established.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n- **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics for *RASA4* (transcript ENST00000262940.9) are:\n    - **pLI**: 0.00, indicating it is not extremely intolerant to protein-truncating variants.\n    - **LOEUF**: 1.13, which does not suggest strong constraint against loss-of-function variants.\n    - **pRec**: 0.69\n    - **pNull**: 0.31\n- **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The low pLI and high LOEUF scores suggest that loss-of-function variants in *RASA4* are generally tolerated in the general population and the gene is not under strong purifying selection.\n- **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: While no definitive pathogenic variants are established for a Mendelian disease, hypermethylation (an epigenetic modification) has been associated with a more aggressive phenotype in JMML.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\nDue to the absence of a defined *RASA4*-related disorder, a comprehensive phenotype spectrum with HPO terms is not available. However, based on its function and associations, potential phenotypes could relate to abnormal signal transduction and cell growth.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n- **Variant Classes and Typical Phenotypes**: Specific genotype-phenotype correlations for *RASA4* variants are not yet established in the context of a Mendelian disorder.\n- **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: The *RASA4* protein contains C2 and PH domains. Variants affecting the C2 domains, which are crucial for plasma membrane association in response to calcium, could potentially disrupt its function in downregulating the Ras-MAPK pathway.\n- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: Currently, there is no established strong genotype-phenotype correlation for *RASA4*.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n- No well-characterized pathogenic variants for a Mendelian disease are listed in ClinVar for *RASA4*. There are numerous variants of uncertain significance and a few benign/likely benign variants reported.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM)**: *RASA4* shows notable expression in skeletal muscle. It is also expressed in various other tissues, including nerve, adipose tissue, and uterus.\n- **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Based on its expression profile, variants in *RASA4* could potentially lead to phenotypes affecting muscle function or other tissues with high expression, although this is speculative.\n- **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: Hypermethylation of a *RASA4* isoform promoter has been linked to older age at diagnosis and poor prognosis in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal Gene Function**: *RASA4* encodes a calcium-dependent Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway.\n- **Disease Mechanism**: The primary disease-associated mechanism identified so far is epigenetic. Hypermethylation of the *RASA4* promoter leads to its silencing, which is associated with a more aggressive disease course in JMML. In cervical cancer, reduced *RASA4* expression is linked to increased cell proliferation.\n- **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: Disruption of *RASA4* function leads to dysregulation of the Ras-MAPK pathway, which is a critical pathway for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This dysregulation can contribute to cancer progression.\n- **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: *RASA4* interacts with Ras proteins, converting them from their active GTP-bound state to the inactive GDP-bound state.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n- **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: Testing for *RASA4* variants is not standard practice for any specific Mendelian disorder at this time.\n- **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: The primary context for clinical investigation of *RASA4* is currently in cancer research, specifically looking at methylation status in JMML as a prognostic marker.\n- **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: Identifying *RASA4* hypermethylation in JMML may indicate a poorer prognosis and a higher risk of relapse after transplantation, potentially influencing treatment decisions.\n- **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Genetic counseling for *RASA4* is not well-defined due to the lack of a clear associated Mendelian disease.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- **Poetsch, A. R., et al. (2014). Epigenetics, 9(9), 1252-1260.** This study identified that hypermethylation of *RASA4* isoform 2 is a recurrent event in JMML and correlates with poor prognostic factors.\n- **Chen, J., et al. (2021).

This means that heterozygous or even homozygous loss-of-function variants are not expected to cause a severe Mendelian disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to loss-of-function, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be gain-of-function or have a dominant-negative effect, though no such variants are currently well-documented in ClinVar.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As MUC20 is not linked to a specific Mendelian syndrome, there are no frequently reported HPO terms. Associations are primarily with cancer-related phenotypes.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No specific secondary HPO terms are consistently associated with MUC20 variants in the context of Mendelian disease.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable due to the lack of a defined Mendelian disease association.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** No established correlations exist between specific MUC20 variant classes and distinct clinical phenotypes in a Mendelian context.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Information is not available to link variants in specific protein domains to particular phenotypes.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Weak to non-existent for Mendelian disease.\n*   **Examples:** There are no well-documented examples of specific variants leading to specific, non-cancer-related phenotypes.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **ClinVar Pathogenic Variants:** There are no variants in MUC20 classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for a Mendelian disorder in ClinVar.

It is also expressed in tissues such as the colon, endometrium, liver, and prostate.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Aberrant expression in specific tissues is linked to cancer. For example, overexpression in the endometrium and ovaries is associated with more aggressive tumors. Decreased expression has been noted in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** MUC20 expression marks the receptive phase of the human endometrium. No specific age-related phenotypes outside of cancer have been described.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** MUC20 is a transmembrane mucin that can regulate the MET signaling cascade by suppressing the GRB2-RAS pathway.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** In cancer, the mechanism appears to be related to altered expression levels (overexpression or underexpression) rather than a classic haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative model for a Mendelian disease.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Overexpression of MUC20 can activate pathways like the integrin \u03b21 signaling in ovarian cancer and the EGFR-STAT3 pathway in endometrial cancer, leading to enhanced cell migration, invasion, and tumor growth.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** MUC20 interacts with the MET proto-oncogene, suppressing some of its signaling pathways.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for MUC20 variants is not standard practice for diagnosing Mendelian disorders due to a lack of association.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** The gene is primarily studied in a research context to understand its role in cancer prognosis and as a potential biomarker.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no direct clinical actions or management guidelines based on MUC20 genotype for Mendelian diseases. In oncology, its expression level may serve as a prognostic factor.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling for MUC20 variants would be challenging due to the absence of a defined disease association and would focus on the uncertainty of the findings.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 26616226 (2016):** Found that MUC20 is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer and is associated with poor overall survival.

        "LRRC37A2": "LRRC37A2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:32404\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 616556\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While no definitive monogenic disease is established, *LRRC37A2* expression is significantly associated with Parkinson's disease. It has also been associated with breast cancer and is implicated in gastric cancer. One database notes associations with Epilepsy, Progressive Myoclonic, 6 and Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 96, though primary evidence is not detailed.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for a causal role in monogenic disease is currently limited or not established; its role appears to be as a risk modifier or a gene involved in complex, multifactorial diseases.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Not applicable for monogenic disease; its effects on complex disease risk are studied through population-level associations (GWAS).\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** A search for *LRRC37A2* in the gnomAD v4.0.0 database did not return any results for constraint metrics (pLI, LOEUF). This is common for genes in complex genomic regions that are difficult to analyze with high confidence.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The absence of constraint data suggests that it is difficult to assess the gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variation using current large-scale population data. This may be due to high sequence homology and copy number variability in its genomic region.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the association with complex diseases, pathogenic variants may be those that alter expression levels (e.g., eQTLs) rather than traditional protein-truncating or missense variants causing a Mendelian disorder. Non-synonymous variants that co-segregate with Parkinson's disease risk alleles have been noted.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are definitively linked to pathogenic variants within *LRRC37A2* itself. The Human Phenotype Ontology database does not list direct annotations for this gene.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Not applicable, as no primary terms are established.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Associations are with adult-onset diseases like Parkinson's disease and various cancers.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The gene's contribution is to complex disease risk, where severity is variable and influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific variants (eQTLs) that alter *LRRC37A2* expression are associated with risk for Parkinson's disease. Increased expression and copy number of *LRRC37A/2* are associated with protective haplotypes for Parkinson's disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Information on specific domain-related phenotypes is not available. The protein contains Leucine-rich repeat domains.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Moderate. The correlation is at the level of risk association for complex diseases, not direct causation of a monogenic disorder. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) identified *LRRC37A2* as the most significant gene associated with Parkinson's disease across 13 brain tissues.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** Risk variants in the *MAPT* region on chromosome 17q21.31 influence *LRRC37A2* expression, which in turn is associated with susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. For instance, the MAPT H1 haplotype is linked to its expression levels.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   A search of ClinVar did not yield any variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic specifically for *LRRC37A2*. The database contains many variants of uncertain significance or those without clinical significance asserted.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** The gene is highly expressed in the testis and also shows expression in the brain. Its expression in various brain tissues is significantly associated with Parkinson's disease. Reduced mRNA levels are observed in gastric cancer tissue.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Brain-related expression correlates with risk for neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. Expression in immune cells may be relevant to viral infections.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The Human Protein Atlas notes expression in early spermatids. Its primary associations are with adult-onset diseases.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *LRRC37A2* is a membrane-associated protein that plays a role in cellular migration, chemotaxis, and the astroglial inflammatory response.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism is not fully elucidated but appears related to altered gene expression levels influencing complex disease risk. In Parkinson's disease, it interacts with \u03b1-synuclein in astrocytes, and its expression level may impact astroglial dysfunction. In gastric cancer, downregulation via DNA methylation is a proposed mechanism.\n*   **Cellular/molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** In Parkinson's disease, altered *LRRC37A2* levels may impair the ability of astrocytes to respond to inflammation and support neurons, contributing to neurodegeneration.\n*   **Protein-protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** *LRRC37A2* directly interacts with soluble \u03b1-synuclein and co-localizes with Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** This gene is not typically tested for diagnostic purposes in Mendelian disease.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is currently for research purposes, primarily in genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association studies for complex diseases like Parkinson's disease and cancer.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would focus on the gene's role as a minor contributor to complex disease risk, emphasizing that it is not a standalone cause for a monogenic disorder.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 34599220, 2021:** A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) that identified *LRRC37A2* as the most significant gene associated with Parkinson's disease risk across 13 brain tissues.\n*   **PMID: 35835483, 2022:** Showed that protective haplotypes for Parkinson's disease at the 17q21.31 locus are associated with increased *LRRC37A/2* copy number and expression, and that the protein is enriched in astrocytes, interacts with \u03b1-synuclein, and is involved in the inflammatory response.\n*   **PMID: 33639315, 2021:** Not directly about *LRRC37A2*, but referenced in a gene database in the context of progressive myoclonic epilepsy, highlighting potential but unconfirmed disease associations.\n*   **PMID: 31792131, 2020:** The flagship paper for gnomAD v3, describing the methods for calculating gene constraint metrics like LOEUF, which are essential for interpreting gene intolerance to variation.\n*   **PMID: 34188102, 2021:** A study identifying *LRRC37A2* as a new candidate susceptibility gene for breast cancer through a transcriptome-wide association study.\n*   **PMID: 35059635, 2022:** Describes Polympact, a tool showing how common variants can affect *LRRC37A2* transcript levels, relevant to diseases like Alzheimer's.\n*   **PMID: 38719946, 2024:** An imputed whole-blood transcriptomic study that identified *LRRC37A2* as part of a gene signature that can discriminate between Parkinson's disease cases and controls.\n*   **Taylor & Francis Online, 2021:** A study demonstrating that *LRRC37A2* is downregulated in gastric cancer, particularly in poorly differentiated tumors, via DNA methylation.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no established high-confidence associations between specific variants in *LRRC37A2* and specific HPO terms for a monogenic disease.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are no HPO terms that strongly suggest a primary pathogenic variant in this gene. Its relevance is currently tied to risk for complex, multifactorial diseases like Parkinson's disease and certain cancers.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The gene is located in the 17q21.31 chromosomal region, which is associated with Koolen-de Vries syndrome when deleted. Phenotypes associated with the broader microdeletion (e.g., developmental delay, hypotonia, characteristic facial features) are caused by haploinsufficiency of other genes in the region, primarily *KANSL1*, not *LRRC37A2*.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in LRRC37A2 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "ARL17B": "ARL17B Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID**: 32387.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID**: There is currently no OMIM entry for ARL17B.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations**: While not linked to a Mendelian disease, ARL17B is associated with risk for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Parkinson's disease. It is also implicated in Koolen-De Vries Syndrome and Glass Syndrome due to its location within the 17q21.31 chromosomal region, which is associated with these syndromes. Additionally, copy number variations in this region that include ARL17B have been identified in cases of developmental dyslexia.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The evidence for ARL17B's role in disease is currently associative and not definitive for a monogenic disorder.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients**: Not applicable for a monogenic disease, but its association with neurodegenerative diseases is linked to risk alleles.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI of 0.00, a LOEUF of 1.18, pRec of 0.58, and pNull of 0.42.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The very low pLI score (closer to 0) and a LOEUF score greater than 1 suggest that ARL17B is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This means that variants that would normally truncate the protein are observed in the general population at a frequency that is not significantly lower than expected, indicating the gene is likely not essential for survival or critical functions in a heterozygous state.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be gain-of-function or have a dominant-negative effect. However, no definitive pathogenic variants have been established.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\nAs ARL17B is not definitively linked to a monogenic disorder, a comprehensive list of HPO terms is not available. Associations are primarily with complex neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n*   **Primary HPO terms**: No specific HPO terms are directly attributed to ARL17B variants in databases like ClinVar or OMIM.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**: Not applicable.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: The associated neurodegenerative diseases, like Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Parkinson's disease, are typically adult-onset.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Not applicable.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: Studies have associated certain SNPs (rs8070723 and rs242557) with altered ARL17B expression levels in the brain, which in turn are associated with risk for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. Specifically, the protective rs8070723-G allele is linked to lower brain levels of ARL17B, while the risk-associated rs242557-A allele is also linked to lower brain levels.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: No specific domain-phenotype correlations have been established.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: The correlation is currently considered associative for complex diseases.\n*   **Examples**:\n    *   rs8070723-G allele (protective for PSP) \u2192 Lower ARL17B brain expression levels.\n    *   rs242557-A allele (risk for PSP) \u2192 Lower ARL17B brain levels.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No definitively pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for ARL17B are listed in ClinVar. The database primarily contains variants of uncertain significance or those associated with complex traits.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation**: ARL17B shows expression in various tissues, with nervous system tissues being particularly relevant due to the association with neurodegenerative diseases. Expression in the temporal cortex has been specifically studied in relation to PSP.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Altered expression in brain tissues is linked to the pathophysiology of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: Its potential involvement in developmental dyslexia suggests a role in neurodevelopmental processes. The link to adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases suggests its function is also important in the aging brain.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: ARL17B is a GTP-binding protein predicted to be involved in intracellular protein transport and vesicle-mediated transport within the Golgi apparatus.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The disease mechanism is likely not due to simple haploinsufficiency, given the gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variants. Altered regulation of gene expression, potentially influenced by risk-associated SNPs and methylation changes, appears to contribute to disease risk for conditions like PSP.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: As a GTPase involved in trafficking, altered ARL17B function could disrupt protein transport and vesicle dynamics in neurons, potentially contributing to the tau pathology seen in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: As a member of the ARF GTPase family, it likely interacts with other proteins involved in vesicle budding and transport, but specific interactions linked to phenotype are not yet defined.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: Testing for ARL17B is not standard practice for diagnosing any monogenic disorder.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: ARL17B is typically analyzed in research settings investigating the genetic basis of neurodegenerative diseases like PSP and Parkinson's, or in studies of the 17q21.31 chromosomal region.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: There is currently no clinical actionability based on ARL17B genotype.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling would focus on the complex, multifactorial nature of the associated neurodegenerative diseases, where ARL17B variants are considered risk factors rather than causative mutations.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 27500532, Year: 2016**: This study established a link between PSP risk SNPs and the expression of ARL17B in the brain, suggesting it as a candidate risk gene. It also correlated these genetic variants with CpG methylation levels and the severity of tau neuropathology.\n*   **Key Phenotype Findings**: The study found that PSP risk alleles at the MAPT locus were associated with altered ARL17B expression and higher levels of neuropathology (coiled bodies and tufted astrocytes).\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: There are currently no high-confidence associations between specific ARL17B variants and HPO terms for monogenic disease.\n*   **Phenotype red flags**: There are no specific \"red flag\" phenotypes that strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in ARL17B itself. However, phenotypes associated with the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome (e.g., Koolen-De Vries Syndrome) might prompt investigation of this chromosomal region, which includes ARL17B.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**: For patients with neurodegenerative symptoms, particularly those overlapping with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy or Parkinson's disease, other genes with more established roles in these conditions should be considered first. For developmental phenotypes, genes within the broader 17q21.31 region, such as KANSL1, are the primary drivers of the associated syndromes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in ARL17B (1/1):\nN/A.

        "AHNAK2": "AHNAK2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 20125.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 608570.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** The primary disease association for AHNAK2 is with an autosomal recessive form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It is also implicated as an oncogene in several cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, and uveal melanoma.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for its role in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is currently classified as \"Limited\" by the Gene Curation Coalition (GenCC). Its association with various cancers is established through multiple expression and prognostic studies.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** For Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the observed inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. In the context of cancer, its role is related to somatic expression levels rather than inheritance.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Based on gnomAD v2.1.1, the pLI score for AHNAK2 is 0.00, suggesting it is not extremely intolerant of protein-truncating variants. The observed/expected (o/e) score for loss-of-function (LoF) variants is 1.04. The pRec score is 0.000 and the pNull score is 1.00.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and o/e close to 1.0 indicate that the gene is tolerant to heterozygous loss-of-function variants in the general population. This is consistent with a recessive inheritance pattern for its associated Mendelian disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For its role in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, biallelic variants (homozygous or compound heterozygous), including missense and frameshift mutations, are implicated. In cancer, overexpression (gain-of-function) is the primary oncogenic mechanism.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** Limited information is available linking specific HPO terms directly to AHNAK2 variants in large cohorts. However, based on case reports for neurodevelopmental disorders, associated terms include Epilepsy (HP:0001250), Psychomotor development delay (HP:0001263), Hypotonia (HP:0001252), and congenital heart disease. For Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, expected terms would relate to peripheral neuropathy.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Additional features reported in a patient with compound heterozygous missense mutations included a cardio-facio-cutaneous-like phenotype, atopic dermatitis, and facial dysmorphism. Other reported features include abnormality of neuronal migration and skeletal deformities.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The age of onset for the reported neurodevelopmental phenotype with epilepsy was in childhood. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease typically manifests in the first or second decade of life. Cancer is typically a disease of adulthood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with AHNAK2 variants is not well established due to the limited number of reported cases. A case with a neurodevelopmental disorder was described as having a severe phenotype.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Autosomal recessive loss-of-function variants (missense, frameshift) have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and a cardio-facio-cutaneous-like syndrome with neurological involvement. Increased expression of AHNAK2 is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis in various cancers.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The AHNAK2 protein has a tripartite structure with an N-terminal PDZ-like domain, a large central repeat region, and a C-terminal domain. Specific correlations between variant location and phenotype have not yet been clearly established.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is currently considered moderate for its association with autosomal recessive neuropathies and neurodevelopmental disorders due to the small number of reported cases. The correlation between high expression and cancer prognosis is supported by numerous studies.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** Compound heterozygous missense mutations, c.1198G>A (p.Gly400Ser) and c.16379T>C (p.Ile5460Thr), were identified in a patient with a cardio-facio-cutaneous-like phenotype, epilepsy, and psychomotor delay.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No extensively characterized pathogenic variants with high-frequency reporting are available in ClinVar for Mendelian disease. The variants reported are primarily from individual case studies.\n*   **c.1198G>A (p.Gly400Ser) / missense / VUS:** Associated with a cardio-facio-cutaneous-like phenotype and epilepsy in a compound heterozygous state; allele frequency is not reported.\n*   **c.16379T>C (p.Ile5460Thr) / missense / VUS:** Found in a compound heterozygous state with the p.Gly400Ser variant in a patient with a CFC-like phenotype.\n*   A frameshift mutation has been linked to dysmorphic features and skeletal deformities.\n*   A missense variant, **c.2695G>T (p.Val899Leu) / VUS,** has been associated with an abnormality of neuronal migration.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, AHNAK2 shows the highest mRNA expression in the skin (both sun-exposed and non-sun-exposed areas). Protein expression is distinct in squamous epithelia, respiratory epithelia, smooth muscle, and neuropil.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Expression in the neuropil is consistent with the neurological phenotypes observed, such as peripheral neuropathy and neurodevelopmental disorders. High expression in various epithelial tissues aligns with its role in multiple adenocarcinomas.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** While specific developmental expression data is limited, its role in congenital heart disease and neurodevelopmental disorders suggests importance during embryogenesis.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The AHNAK2 gene encodes a very large nucleoprotein that may be involved in calcium signaling and the structural linkage of the muscle cell cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** For Mendelian disorders, the mechanism is likely loss-of-function in an autosomal recessive pattern. In cancer, the mechanism is gain-of-function, where overexpression promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** In cancer, AHNAK2 overexpression is linked to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the c-MET signaling pathway, leading to increased cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Its potential role in calcium signaling could underlie the neurological phenotypes.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** AHNAK2 is known to form homodimers via its PDZ-like domain. It interacts with fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) in a stress-induced secretion pathway and may interact with calcium channel proteins. In cancer, it can modulate the stability of the c-MET protein.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for AHNAK2 variants in cohorts with suspected hereditary disease is low. It has been identified as a candidate gene in studies of congenital heart disease and nephrotic syndrome, but its definitive causal role in these cohorts is not yet established.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for AHNAK2 may be considered in patients with clinical features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease where more common genetic causes have been excluded, or in individuals with complex neurodevelopmental syndromes.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** For patients with a diagnosis related to AHNAK2, management is supportive and based on the phenotype (e.g., physical therapy for neuropathy, anti-seizure medication for epilepsy). There are currently no targeted therapies for AHNAK2-related Mendelian disorders. In cancer, high AHNAK2 expression may serve as a poor prognostic marker.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For families with biallelic pathogenic variants, genetic counseling would focus on the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, with a 25% recurrence risk for future offspring.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 35789128, 2022:** Reported compound heterozygous missense mutations in a patient with a cardio-facio-cutaneous-like phenotype, epilepsy, and psychomotor developmental delay, expanding the known phenotypic spectrum.\n*   **PMID: 31215093, 2019:** First identified AHNAK2 as a novel genetic cause for autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in a Malaysian family through linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing.\n*   **PMID: 28600779, 2017:** A study on genetic diseases in Saudi Arabia identified a frameshift AHNAK2 mutation associated with dysmorphic features and skeletal deformities.\n*   **PMID: 28279935, 2017:** Demonstrated that AHNAK2 is upregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, promotes tumorigenesis and progression, and is linked to the hypoxia pathway, suggesting it as a prognostic marker and oncogenic protein.\n*   **PMID: 32821425, 2020:** Showed AHNAK2 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis and cell migration in lung adenocarcinoma.\n*   **PMID: 32968434, 2020:** A bioinformatic analysis identifying AHNAK2 as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for papillary thyroid carcinoma, potentially acting through immune-related pathways.\n*   **PMID: 36746884, 2023:** Found AHNAK2 promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progression by stabilizing the c-MET protein, suggesting it as a therapeutic target.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations due to the limited number of reported cases. Existing evidence points to biallelic loss-of-function variants causing a spectrum of neurological disorders.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of a peripheral neuropathy (consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) or a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with features like epilepsy, developmental delay, and congenital anomalies in a patient with biallelic variants in AHNAK2 should raise suspicion.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease caused by AHNAK2 overlaps with other forms of CMT. The reported cardio-facio-cutaneous-like syndrome overlaps with the RASopathies, though the inheritance pattern (autosomal recessive for AHNAK2) is a key differentiator.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in AHNAK2 (2/2):\nN/A.

It is located in the complex 17q21.31 region, and its copy number variation is associated with risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The clinical significance of LRRC37A variants is largely unknown. It is not currently associated with a Mendelian disease, but evidence suggests a role as a risk modifier in complex neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients**: Not applicable, as no monogenic disorder is currently linked to LRRC37A. Association with complex diseases does not follow Mendelian inheritance patterns.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: gnomAD v2.1.1 data shows a pLI score of 0.00, a pNull score of 1.00, and a pRec score of 0.00. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction (LOEUF) is 1.13.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The extremely low pLI score (close to 0) and high LOEUF score (greater than 1.0) indicate that the gene is highly tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, single nucleotide variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site) are unlikely to be pathogenic on their own. Pathogenicity, if any, may be related to copy number changes or variants that confer a gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect, potentially in the context of complex disease.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**: No primary HPO terms are directly and causally associated with variants in LRRC37A alone.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**: While no specific HPO terms are directly linked to LRRC37A variants, the gene's association with the 17q21.31 locus implicates it in phenotypes related to associated syndromes like Koolen-de Vries syndrome and neurodegenerative disorders. HPO terms used in related research include those for Parkinson's disease, such as `Abnormality of movement` (HP:0100022) and `Neurodegeneration` (HP:0002180).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: Not applicable due to the lack of a defined monogenic disease. Associations with neurodegenerative diseases imply an adult onset.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Not applicable.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: Copy number variations (CNVs) of LRRC37A, rather than single-nucleotide variants, have been correlated with disease risk. Increased copy number and expression of LRRC37A/2 are associated with protection against Parkinson's disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: Information is not available. The protein contains leucine-rich repeat domains predicted to be involved in protein-ligand interactions.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: The correlation is currently considered associative for complex diseases, not causal for a monogenic disorder. The link between LRRC37A CNVs and Parkinson's disease risk is moderate but requires further study to establish causality.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes**: The H1 haplotype at the 17q21.31 locus, which can have different LRRC37A copy numbers, is associated with Parkinson's disease risk. Specific protective sub-haplotypes are linked to a higher copy number of LRRC37A/2.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No well-characterized pathogenic or likely pathogenic single-nucleotide variants have been reported in ClinVar for LRRC37A causing a monogenic disease.\n*   ClinVar lists several copy number variations in the 17q21.31 region that include LRRC37A and are associated with Koolen-de Vries syndrome, but LRRC37A is not considered the sole driver of this phenotype.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation**: In humans, LRRC37A expression is noted in the cerebellum and thymus. Studies have shown it is primarily expressed in astrocytes in the human substantia nigra, which is highly relevant to its proposed role in Parkinson's disease pathology. Ancestral expression was restricted to the testis.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Based on its expression in astrocytes, variants or copy number changes might lead to phenotypes related to astroglial dysfunction, such as altered inflammatory responses or impaired neuroprotection, contributing to neurodegenerative processes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: The evolutionary expansion of the LRRC37 gene family in primates and changes in its expression pattern suggest a role in the development and function of the primate brain. Its association with adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases aligns with this.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: The LRRC37A protein is a membrane-associated protein that may be secreted and is implicated in cellular migration, chemotaxis, and the inflammatory response.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The mechanism is not fully understood. In the context of Parkinson's disease, altered dosage (copy number) of LRRC37A appears to modify disease risk, suggesting a dosage-sensitive role in neuroinflammation and astroglial function. This is not a classic haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative mechanism for a monogenic disease.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: LRRC37A/2 overexpression upregulates cellular migration and chemotaxis pathways and increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Its interaction with \u03b1-synuclein in astrocytes suggests it plays a role in the pathological processes of synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: LRRC37A/2 has been shown to interact directly with soluble \u03b1-synuclein and co-localizes with Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease brain tissue.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: Zero for monogenic disease. Testing for LRRC37A is not currently performed for diagnostic purposes.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: Currently, testing is purely for research purposes, primarily to investigate the complex genetics of the 17q21.31 locus in relation to neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: None at present.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling would focus on the complex nature of the 17q21.31 locus and the gene's role as a potential risk modifier for complex diseases like Parkinson's, rather than a direct cause of a monogenic disorder. The low pLI score indicates that loss-of-function variants found in a patient are unlikely to be clinically significant on their own.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 35836262, 2022**: Showed that protective sub-haplotypes at the 17q21.31 locus are associated with increased copy number and expression of LRRC37A/2, linking it to Parkinson's disease risk via astroglial inflammation.\n*   **PMID: 23175404, 2013**: Detailed the evolutionary expansion of the LRRC37 gene family in primates, noting its ancestral expression in the testis and acquired expression in the cerebellum and thymus in hominids.\n*   **PMID: 29782414, 2018**: Associated a duplication within the 17q21.31 region with upregulated LRRC37A/LRRC37A2 expression and risk of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).\n*   **bioRxiv, 2021 (preprint)**: First proposed that LRRC37A/2 contributes to the Parkinson's disease association at the 17q21.31 locus through its interaction with \u03b1-synuclein and its effects on astrocytic function.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: There are no high-confidence associations between specific LRRC37A variants and HPO terms for a monogenic disease.\n*   **Phenotype red flags**: There are no specific HPO terms that are considered red flags for a pathogenic variant in LRRC37A. The gene is not a known cause of Mendelian disease.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**: Because LRRC37A is part of the 17q21.31 locus, large copy number variations involving this gene are seen in Koolen-de Vries syndrome. However, the phenotype of this syndrome is attributed to the loss of multiple genes, primarily KANSL1, not LRRC37A alone.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in LRRC37A (1/1):\nN/A.

It is also linked to Neuronopathy, Distal Hereditary Motor, Autosomal Dominant 2, and Primary Hypoalphalipoproteinemia, though evidence for causality is not definitive.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of *HCAR3* variants is largely considered uncertain or of associative risk, with no definitive pathogenic variants leading to a Mendelian disorder established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Not applicable as no confirmed Mendelian disease is associated with this gene.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI score of 0.00, a LOEUF of 1.15, pRec of 0.547, and pNull of 0.453.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The very low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that *HCAR3* is extremely tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be gain-of-function or have a dominant-negative effect. Some frameshift and missense variants have been investigated in the context of cancer risk.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As there is no defined Mendelian disease, a ranked list of HPO terms is not applicable.

Specific examples with sufficient evidence for this dossier are not available. A search for pathogenic variants in ClinVar returned a limited number of results with uncertain significance for Mendelian disease.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** *HCAR3* shows high expression in immune cells like neutrophils and macrophages, as well as in keratinocytes and adipocytes. This expression pattern supports its potential role in inflammation, skin biology, and metabolism.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Based on expression, variants could plausibly impact immune responses (e.g., in inflammatory conditions), skin integrity or disease (e.g., psoriasis), and metabolic processes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Specific data on developmental expression and age-related phenotypes are not well-documented in the search results.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *HCAR3* encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that responds to metabolites like 3-hydroxy-octanoic acid and kynurenic acid, regulating cellular metabolism and immune responses.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** For schizophrenia, elevated *HCAR3* expression (a potential gain-of-function mechanism) is associated with disease risk. In breast cancer, it has been suggested to act as an oncogene. A specific disease mechanism for a Mendelian disorder has not been defined.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** In adipocytes, HCAR3 activation inhibits lipolysis via G\u03b1i-mediated reduction of cAMP. In immune cells, it is thought to modulate intracellular calcium levels and may have immunosuppressive effects. In keratinocytes, it is involved in proliferation, migration, and metabolism.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** *HCAR3* signals through G\u03b1i/o-type G proteins. It also forms dimers with its paralog, HCAR2 (GPR109A).\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Zero for Mendelian disorders. Testing for this gene is not standard practice for diagnosis.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Currently, testing is performed in a research context, for example, to investigate its role in complex diseases like schizophrenia or its potential as a therapeutic target.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present. Variants in *HCAR3* could potentially serve as biomarkers for niacin efficacy, but this is still under investigation.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would focus on the uncertain role of *HCAR3* variants and the lack of a defined disease association, emphasizing that variants are currently considered of uncertain significance for Mendelian disease.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 37984442, 2024:** Identified *HCAR3* as a novel susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, linking the rs2454721 variant to blunted niacin response and increased gene expression.\n*   **PMID: 34844621, 2021:** Identified rare, potentially pathogenic germline variants in *HCAR3* (e.g., p.Q373Kfs*82) in breast cancer cases, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene.\n*   **PMID: 33432025, 2021:** In a study on Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum, *HCAR3* was one of four prioritized genes with variants potentially modifying the severity of cardiovascular disease.\n*   **bioRxiv, 2023:** Showed that *HCAR3* is highly expressed in human keratinocytes and plays a role in epithelial proliferation, migration, and metabolism, suggesting its importance in skin biology.\n*   **PMID: 31735928, 2020:** A review highlighting that HCAR3 is exclusive to humans and higher primates, is activated by the metabolite kynurenic acid, and has potential as an immunological drug target due to its expression in immune cells.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** No high-confidence associations currently exist due to the lack of a confirmed monogenic disease link.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are currently no \"red flag\" HPO terms that strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in *HCAR3*.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Given the associations with metabolic and immune functions, phenotypes overlapping with other metabolic or immunoregulatory disorders could be considered, but *HCAR3* would not be a primary candidate for differential diagnosis at this time.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in HCAR3 (1/1):\nN/A.

Some studies have also explored its role in various cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for a direct role in monogenic disease is still emerging; however, its association with complex skin disorders is moderate.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The influence of HRNR variants on disease susceptibility appears to follow a complex, multifactorial inheritance pattern, often interacting with other genetic factors, such as mutations in the *FLG* gene.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** A search for HRNR-specific constraint scores in gnomAD did not yield specific numeric values for pLI, LOEUF, pRec, or pNull in the provided search results. These metrics are used to assess a gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Generally, a high pLI (e.g., >0.9) and a low LOEUF score suggest that a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function mutations and is more likely to be associated with a dominant disease. The absence of these scores for HRNR may suggest it does not meet the threshold for strong constraint against heterozygous loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While definitive pathogenic variants are not well-established, studies have investigated the role of missense variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in disease susceptibility. Loss-of-function variants would be of interest given the gene's role in barrier function.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Ichthyosis (HP:0000962)\n    *   Atopic dermatitis (HP:0001047)\n    *   Dry skin (HP:0000958)\n    *   Hyperkeratosis (HP:0000962)\n    *   Erythroderma (HP:0001017)\n    *   Allergic sensitization (HP:0002235)\n    *   Asthma (HP:0002099)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Photosensitivity (HP:0000992)\n    *   Ectropion (HP:0000656)\n    *   Abnormality of the auricular pavilion (HP:0000356)\n    *   Equinovarus (HP:0001762)\n    *   Flexion contracture of finger (HP:0012788)\n    *   Hyporeflexia (HP:0001265)\n    *   Dental abnormality (HP:0000164)\n    *   Cognitive deficit (HP:0100543)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Associations with atopic eczema have been studied in children from infancy (under 2 years) through childhood (up to 6 years). A case report of ichthyosis described a patient with features present from birth.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity can range from mild, such as dry skin, to more severe manifestations of ichthyosis requiring significant medical management. In the context of atopic diseases, HRNR variants may contribute to more complex phenotypes like eczema-associated asthma.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific variants, such as the SNP rs877776[C], have been associated with atopic eczema, allergic sensitization, and susceptibility to asthma in combination with eczema.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The search results did not contain specific information linking variants in particular HRNR protein domains to distinct phenotypes.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between HRNR variants and atopic phenotypes is considered moderate and supplementary to the stronger, well-established associations with *FLG* mutations. The evidence suggests a gene-gene interaction modulating disease risk.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** The risk variant rs877776[C] is associated with atopic eczema and, when combined with *FLG* mutations, significantly increases the risk for this condition and for eczema-associated asthma.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **rs877776 (G>C):**\n    *   **Significance:** Risk allele for atopic disease.\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes (HPO terms):** Atopic dermatitis (HP:0001047), Allergic sensitization (HP:0002235), Asthma (HP:0002099).\n    *   **AF:** Not specified in the search results.\n*   **Variants in a case of Ichthyosis:**\n    *   A 19-year-old male with severe ichthyosis was found to have variants in both *ABCA12* and *HRNR*, suggesting a potential combined effect or a role for the *HRNR* variant in the phenotype. Specific HGVS nomenclature for the *HRNR* variant was not provided in the abstract.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** HRNR is primarily expressed in the epidermis, specifically in the upper granular layer of keratinocytes. This localization is consistent with its role in forming the cornified cell envelope and maintaining the skin barrier.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its high expression in the skin, variants are expected to primarily manifest as skin barrier defects, leading to conditions like ichthyosis and atopic dermatitis. Reduced HRNR expression is observed in skin lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** HRNR is expressed during wound healing and in regenerating skin. Its role is critical for the proper formation and maintenance of the skin from birth.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** Hornerin is a structural protein and a component of the epidermal cornified cell envelopes, essential for skin barrier integrity.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary proposed disease mechanism is loss-of-function, leading to a weakened skin barrier. Reduced HRNR expression, potentially due to genetic variants, is thought to contribute to barrier defects in atopic dermatitis.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** HRNR is part of the S100 fused-type protein family and is involved in keratinocyte differentiation and the \"establishment of skin barrier\" GO pathway. Its disruption leads to impaired cornification, increasing susceptibility to environmental allergens and pathogens, which manifests as atopic dermatitis and ichthyosis. It may also play a role in tumor progression through the AKT pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** HRNR function is similar and complementary to that of filaggrin (FLG). Post-translational deimination of hornerin enhances its cross-linking by transglutaminases and its processing by calpain-1, which are critical steps for its incorporation into the cornified envelope.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for HRNR variants is not standard for a specific monogenic disease but is performed in research contexts for complex diseases like atopic dermatitis. In one study of children with atopic eczema, genotyping for the *HRNR* variant rs877776 was performed to assess risk.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** The primary reason for investigating *HRNR* is in research studies exploring the genetic underpinnings of atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis, and other skin barrier disorders, often in conjunction with *FLG* testing.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identifying risk variants in *HRNR* could, in the future, contribute to risk stratification for developing atopic dermatitis and related allergic diseases. This information may emphasize the importance of aggressive skin barrier protection and early management in at-risk individuals.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counselors should emphasize the complex nature of inheritance, where *HRNR* variants are considered risk factors rather than direct causes of disease. The risk is often compounded by variants in other genes like *FLG* and environmental factors.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 35984635, 2022:** Showed that the *HRNR* risk variant rs877776[C] was associated with atopic eczema, allergic sensitization, and eczema-associated asthma, with effects that are supplementary to *FLG* mutations.\n*   **PMID: 34006249, 2021:** A case report of a 19-year-old with severe ichthyosis who had variants in both *ABCA12* and *HRNR*, highlighting the potential contribution of *HRNR* to severe skin phenotypes.\n*   **PMID: 29999551, 2018:** Investigated the role of hornerin in hepatocellular carcinoma, finding that its overexpression was associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis via the AKT pathway.\n*   **PMID: 15507469, 2005:** First identified human hornerin and noted its expression in regenerating and psoriatic skin.\n*   **New Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Discovered:** The interaction between *HRNR* variant rs877776 and *FLG* mutations creates a significantly higher risk for atopic eczema and eczema-associated asthma than either genetic factor alone, demonstrating a synergistic effect.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   The *HRNR* variant rs877776[C] is moderately associated with Atopic dermatitis (HP:0001047). The confidence in this association increases significantly when a co-occurring loss-of-function mutation in *FLG* is present.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:**\n    *   A combination of Atopic dermatitis (HP:0001047) and Asthma (HP:0002099) in a patient, especially with a family history of atopy, should raise suspicion for susceptibility variants in genes like *HRNR* and *FLG*.\n    *   The presence of Ichthyosis (HP:0000962) from birth warrants investigation of skin barrier genes, including *HRNR*, though other genes like *ABCA12* are more commonly associated with severe forms.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:**\n    *   The phenotype of atopic dermatitis associated with *HRNR* variants significantly overlaps with that caused by mutations in *FLG* (Filaggrin), which is a major gene for ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis.\n    *   Variants in *FLG2*, another member of the filaggrin family, are also associated with atopic eczema and may have supplementary effects.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in HRNR (1/1):\nN/A.

        "PRAMEF18": "PRAMEF18 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n- **HGNC ID**: 30693.\n- **OMIM gene ID**: No OMIM entry for PRAMEF18 could be located.\n- **Primary disease associations**: Currently, no definitive disease associations have been established in databases like OMIM or GenCC. GeneCards lists a potential association with Amebiasis, though this is likely not a Mendelian disease context.\n- **Clinical significance level**: No evidence of clinical significance has been submitted or curated by resources like GenCC or ClinVar at this time.\n- **Inheritance patterns observed in patients**: No established inheritance patterns are documented due to the lack of confirmed disease-associated variants in patients.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n- **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: Specific constraint metrics for PRAMEF18 from gnomAD were not found in the search results. General information indicates pLI scores closer to 1 suggest intolerance to protein-truncating variants, and for gnomAD v4.0, a LOEUF < 0.6 is a recommended threshold for defining loss-of-function constrained genes.\n- **Clinical interpretation of constraint scores**: Genes with high pLI scores (e.g., \u2265 0.9) are often intolerant to loss-of-function variants and may be associated with dominant diseases through haploinsufficiency. A low LOEUF score indicates a gene is under strong selection against loss-of-function variants.\n- **Variant classes most likely to be pathogenic**: Without known pathogenic variants, this is speculative. However, for genes intolerant to loss-of-function, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants are most likely to be pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n- **Primary HPO terms**: No specific HPO terms are linked to PRAMEF18 in clinical databases.\n- **Secondary HPO terms**: Mouse model data from MGI suggests potential phenotypic areas if the gene function is conserved, including homeostasis/metabolism, growth/size, cellular phenotypes, and abnormalities of the cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, visual, and auditory systems.\n- **Age of onset patterns**: No information available for PRAMEF18.\n- **Phenotype severity spectrum**: No information available for PRAMEF18.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n- **Variant classes and their typical phenotypes**: No genotype-phenotype correlations have been established for PRAMEF18 as no pathogenic variants with associated clinical descriptions have been reported.\n- **Protein domain-specific phenotype patterns**: This is not applicable as no variant-phenotype associations are known. UniProt describes a PRAME domain within the protein.\n- **Genotype-phenotype correlation strength**: Not applicable.\n- **Examples**: Not applicable.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n- No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for PRAMEF18 are listed in ClinVar or other public databases. UniProt's viewer lists 787 variants from various sources, but none have established clinical significance.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest expressing tissues (GTEx TPM) and clinical correlation**: A comprehensive transcriptomic landscape analysis using GTEx data has been performed, but specific expression data for PRAMEF18 was not retrieved. The GTEx project aims to link gene expression in various tissues to genetic variation to understand disease.\n- **Tissue-specific phenotypes expected**: Based on mouse model phenotypes, one might expect abnormalities in systems where the gene is highly expressed, but specific human tissue expression data is needed.\n- **Expression during development and age-related phenotypes**: One study in NCBI's Gene database notes a project analyzing tissue-specific circular RNA induction during human fetal development, which might contain relevant data.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal gene function in one sentence**: The PRAMEF18 protein is predicted to function as a substrate adaptor in a Cul2-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a role in proteasome-mediated protein degradation.\n- **Disease mechanism**: Given the predicted function, pathogenic loss-of-function variants could lead to disease through haploinsufficiency, where 50% of the protein product is insufficient for normal function.\n- **Cellular/molecular pathways disrupted \u2192 phenotype consequences**: Disruption of ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism could lead to the accumulation of substrate proteins, affecting processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, as suggested by GO terms.\n- **Protein-protein interactions relevant to phenotype**: PRAMEF18 belongs to the PRAME family and is predicted to be part of a Cul2-RING ubiquitin ligase complex; interactions within this complex would be critical to its function.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n- **Diagnostic yield in clinical cohorts**: The diagnostic yield is currently zero, as no diseases have been definitively linked to this gene.\n- **Most common reasons for testing this gene**: There are currently no established clinical reasons to order testing for this gene.\n- **Clinical actionability and management implications**: Not applicable.\n- **Genetic counseling considerations**: Not applicable.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- No specific clinical genetics publications focused on PRAMEF18 and human disease phenotypes were identified in the search. General studies on genotype-phenotype correlation, the Human Phenotype Ontology, and large-scale sequencing databases provide the framework for how such a gene would be evaluated if a disease link were suspected.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n- **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: No high-confidence associations exist for PRAMEF18.\n- **Phenotype red flags**: None are known.

        "FOXD4L3": "FOXD4L3 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: FOXD4L3**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 18523.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 611086.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While diseases like Retinitis Pigmentosa 55 have been associated with FOXD4L3, the evidence for a direct causal relationship is not definitively established in major databases like OMIM, which currently lists no specific gene-phenotype relationships.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of variants in FOXD4L3 is still being determined, with some variants reported as pathogenic in ClinVar, though comprehensive evidence linking the gene to a specific, well-defined syndrome is limited.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Given its role as a transcription factor, variants could theoretically follow autosomal dominant or recessive patterns, but specific inheritance patterns in patients are not yet well-documented in the literature.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Specific constraint scores for FOXD4L3 from gnomAD are not readily available in the initial search results. These metrics are crucial for assessing the gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variants. The pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) score helps determine if a gene is likely to be associated with a dominant disease through haploinsufficiency. A low LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) score indicates intolerance to loss-of-function variation.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A high pLI (typically \u2265 0.9) suggests that the gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variants, making such variants more likely to be pathogenic. A low LOEUF score similarly points towards a gene being constrained. The absence of these scores for FOXD4L3 requires a cautious approach to variant interpretation.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For transcription factors, loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site) are often pathogenic. Missense variants within critical functional domains, such as the forkhead DNA-binding domain, are also strong candidates for pathogenicity.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As a comprehensive list of HPO terms linked directly to FOXD4L3 variants in patients is not available from the search, a definitive ranking is not possible. However, given its paralog's (FOXD4) association with neurodevelopmental and cardiac issues, relevant HPO terms could include those related to developmental delay and cardiomyopathy. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for describing phenotypic abnormalities.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Based on broad functional predictions and paralog associations, less common but potential HPO terms could involve abnormalities of the eye (vision/eye phenotype from MGI) and other anatomical morphogenesis defects.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Without defined disease associations, age of onset patterns are speculative. However, given its predicted role in development, pathogenic variants might manifest from the prenatal period through childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with transcription factor mutations can be highly variable, ranging from mild to severe, often dependent on the specific variant's effect on protein function.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific correlations for FOXD4L3 are not yet established. Generally, for transcription factors, null variants (nonsense/frameshift) leading to haploinsufficiency might cause one set of phenotypes, while missense variants in the DNA-binding domain could have dominant-negative effects leading to different or more severe phenotypes.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Variants in the central forkhead DNA-binding domain (approximately amino acids 108-202) would be most likely to impair the protein's primary function and lead to a clinical phenotype.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlations for FOXD4L3 is currently weak to nonexistent due to a lack of sufficient case data.\n*   **Examples:** No specific, well-documented examples of FOXD4L3 variants leading to defined phenotypes were identified in the search results.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   ClinVar lists some variants in FOXD4L3 with reported pathogenicity, including large-scale copy number variations and inversions. However, detailed phenotype descriptions with HPO terms for specific small variants are lacking in the aggregated results.\n*   For example, ClinVar shows pathogenic assertions for large duplications (GRCh37/hg19 9p24.3-q21.11(chr9:203861-70984588)x3) and a large inversion, though the associated phenotypes are not provided or are broad.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, FOXD4L3 is most highly expressed in the brain, specifically the Hippocampus, Cortex, and Frontal Cortex (BA9). It also shows expression in other tissues like the right atrium and smooth muscle of the duodenum and stomach.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High brain expression suggests that pathogenic variants would likely lead to neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Expression in cardiac tissue could imply a risk for cardiac abnormalities, a feature seen with its paralog FOXD4.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** As a transcription factor involved in morphogenesis and cell differentiation, its expression is critical during embryonic development. This suggests that pathogenic variants would likely cause congenital or early-onset disorders.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** FOXD4L3 is a predicted DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates the transcription of other genes by RNA polymerase II, playing a role in anatomical structure morphogenesis and cell differentiation.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Potential disease mechanisms include haploinsufficiency, where a 50% reduction in protein level (due to a loss-of-function variant) is insufficient for normal function, or a dominant-negative effect, where an altered protein interferes with the function of the normal protein from the other allele.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of this transcription factor could impact pathways critical for neural development and cell differentiation, potentially leading to neurodevelopmental disorders or other congenital anomalies.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** As a transcription factor, its interactions with co-activators, co-repressors, and other components of the transcriptional machinery would be critical. Specific interactions relevant to phenotype are not yet detailed.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for FOXD4L3 is likely low and not well-established, as it is not currently a well-defined disease gene.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for FOXD4L3 would likely occur in the context of large gene panels or exome/genome sequencing for individuals with complex, unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders, eye conditions, or congenital anomalies.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, without a defined disease association, clinical actionability is limited. Management would be supportive and based on the patient's specific symptoms.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would involve discussing the uncertainty of the findings, the potential for a wide range of phenotypes, and the lack of established genotype-phenotype correlations.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   At present, there are no landmark clinical studies that have established a definitive genotype-phenotype correlation for FOXD4L3. Much of the available information is predictive, based on its gene family and expression patterns. The complexity of establishing such correlations often requires large patient cohorts and detailed functional studies.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for FOXD4L3.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** While not definitive, the combination of HPO terms related to neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, and potentially eye or cardiac abnormalities, in the absence of a diagnosis from other known genes, might raise suspicion for a variant in FOXD4L3, warranting further investigation.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotypic overlap would likely be with other syndromes caused by mutations in transcription factors involved in development. This could include a broad range of neurodevelopmental disorders with or without congenital anomalies.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in FOXD4L3 (1/1):\nN/A.

The slightly higher expression in the testis is noted, but no associated phenotype is known.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Information on developmental expression is not readily available.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** SPDYE6 belongs to the Speedy/RINGO family of proteins which are known to bind and activate cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), thereby playing a role in cell cycle regulation.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** No disease mechanism has been established for SPDYE6. Given the constraint metrics, haploinsufficiency is unlikely.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The gene is implicated in the oocyte meiosis and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathways. Disruption of these pathways could theoretically lead to reproductive phenotypes, but this has not been clinically observed.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** As a member of the Speedy/RINGO family, it likely interacts with CDKs, but the specific phenotypic relevance of these interactions is unknown.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for SPDYE6 in clinical cohorts is effectively zero, as it is not currently included in most diagnostic gene panels for specific phenotypes.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** There are no common clinical reasons for testing this gene at present.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are no known clinical actionability or management implications associated with variants in SPDYE6.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the lack of a known disease association, genetic counseling would focus on the uncertainty of findings in this gene.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\n*   Currently, there are no key clinical publications that establish a definitive link between variants in SPDYE6 and a specific human phenotype. The existing literature is primarily focused on the molecular function of the Speedy/RINGO protein family in cell cycle control.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** There are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for SPDYE6 at this time.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are currently no known \"red flag\" phenotypes that would strongly suggest pathogenic variants in SPDYE6.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Not applicable due to the lack of a defined disease phenotype.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in SPDYE6 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "PCDHB16": "PCDHB16 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **PCDHB16 Gene Dossier**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 14546\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 606345\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While directly causative links to a specific Mendelian disease are not yet definitively established, *PCDHB16* has been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The broader Protocadherin Beta Cluster, to which *PCDHB16* belongs, is associated with conditions like microcephaly.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of variants in *PCDHB16* is still under investigation, and as of now, it would be considered to have a limited or uncertain level of evidence for causing a specific disease.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Given its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders, both de novo mutations and inherited variants could be relevant, but specific inheritance patterns for *PCDHB16*-related phenotypes have not been clearly defined.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** As of the latest gnomAD data, specific constraint metrics for *PCDHB16* are not prominently reported in top-level search results. Generally, a pLI score \u2265 0.9 indicates a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations. The Loss-of-function Observed/Expected Upper bound Fraction (LOEUF) is a newer metric, with lower values suggesting higher constraint.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** High pLI and low LOEUF scores for a gene suggest that LoF variants are not tolerated in the general population and are more likely to be pathogenic, often associated with a haploinsufficient disease mechanism. Without specific scores for *PCDHB16*, interpretation remains general.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For genes intolerant to LoF, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants are most likely to be pathogenic. The pathogenicity of missense variants would depend on their location and functional impact.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As direct disease correlations are limited, a comprehensive list of HPO terms is not available. Based on its association with Autism Spectrum Disorder, relevant HPO terms would include:\n    *   HP:0000717 - Autism\n    *   HP:0000729 - Autistic behavior\n    *   HP:0001249 - Intellectual disability\n    *   HP:0002376 - Developmental regression\n    *   HP:0001250 - Seizures\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Given the gene's function in neuronal connectivity, other potential, less frequently documented HPO terms might relate to broader neurodevelopmental or neurological abnormalities.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** For neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, the age of onset is typically in early childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders can range from mild to severe.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** There is currently insufficient data to establish clear correlations between specific *PCDHB16* variant classes and distinct phenotypes.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The PCDHB16 protein contains multiple cadherin domains in its extracellular region. Variants in these domains could disrupt cell-cell adhesion, but specific phenotype patterns linked to these domains have not been described.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlations for *PCDHB16* is currently weak to non-existent due to a lack of sufficient clinical case data.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   A search of ClinVar did not yield well-characterized pathogenic variants for *PCDHB16* with detailed phenotype associations. The UniProt database notes over 1,200 variants, but their clinical significance is largely not established.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides data on RNA-seq expression. While specific TPM values were not retrieved in the search, *PCDHB16* is noted to have expression in the brain, which is consistent with its proposed neurological function. Expression is also noted in various other tissues including the testis, stomach, and skin. Mouse ortholog data shows high expression in the epididymis.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Based on brain expression, phenotypes would be expected to be primarily neurological, including cognitive and behavioral abnormalities.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** As a protocadherin, *PCDHB16* is likely involved in developmental processes, particularly the establishment of neuronal connections. Therefore, pathogenic variants would be expected to manifest as congenital or early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *PCDHB16* encodes a potential calcium-dependent cell-adhesion protein that may be involved in establishing and maintaining specific neuronal connections in the brain.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The likely disease mechanism for a LoF variant in a constrained gene would be haploinsufficiency, where the loss of one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause disease. Other mechanisms like dominant-negative effects are also possible.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** As a cell-adhesion molecule, disruption of *PCDHB16* would likely impair homophilic cell-cell adhesion, affecting synapse formation and maintenance. This could lead to aberrant neural circuitry, manifesting as neurodevelopmental phenotypes.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** *PCDHB16* is part of the protocadherin beta cluster, and these proteins are known to interact with other cadherins and intracellular signaling molecules to regulate cellular processes.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield of testing *PCDHB16* in clinical cohorts with neurodevelopmental disorders is currently unknown but likely very low given the limited evidence for its role in disease.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for *PCDHB16* would most likely occur as part of a large gene panel or whole-exome sequencing for individuals with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no specific management guidelines related to *PCDHB16* variants. Management would be based on the patient's observed phenotypes.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counselors should emphasize the uncertain clinical significance of most *PCDHB16* variants. The discussion would revolve around the gene's potential role in neurodevelopment and the limited data available to predict penetrance and expressivity.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   Currently, there are no landmark clinical studies that have definitively established a genotype-phenotype correlation for *PCDHB16*. Research has primarily focused on the genomic organization of the protocadherin cluster and its general role in neuronal development. Publications listed in GeneCards and NCBI are mainly related to the gene family and its expression.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** At present, there are no high-confidence associations between specific *PCDHB16* variants and HPO terms.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The presence of core features of Autism Spectrum Disorder (e.g., HP:0000717 - Autism, HP:0000729 - Autistic behavior) in a patient with a rare, predicted LoF variant in *PCDHB16* might raise suspicion, but this would not be considered a strong indicator on its own.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of autism spectrum disorder is highly heterogeneous and is associated with hundreds of other genes. A differential diagnosis would include a wide range of other syndromic and non-syndromic causes of autism and intellectual disability.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PCDHB16 (2/2):\nN/A.

However, it is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma progression. It has also been studied in the context of pulmonary function.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of CCDC110 in Mendelian disease is not yet established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Not applicable as no Mendelian disease is currently linked to this gene.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI of 0.00, and a LOEUF of 1.13. Missense Z-score is -0.92.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores suggest that CCDC110 is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. Genes with these scores are generally not considered candidates for diseases caused by haploinsufficiency.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be missense with a specific gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect, though this is speculative.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As CCDC110 is not currently associated with a Mendelian disorder, there are no established primary HPO terms.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are definitively linked to CCDC110 variants in a clinical setting.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** No established correlations exist between specific variant classes and phenotypes for CCDC110-related Mendelian disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The protein contains a coiled-coil domain, a leucine zipper motif, and nuclear localization signals, but specific phenotype patterns have not been linked to these domains in a clinical genetic context.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** A deletion of the 4q35.1q35.2 region, which includes CCDC110, was reported in an asymptomatic family, suggesting that loss of one copy of this gene may not lead to an obvious clinical phenotype.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   As there are no confirmed pathogenic variants in ClinVar associated with a Mendelian phenotype, this section is not applicable. Most listed variants in databases like dbSNP are common polymorphisms.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** CCDC110 shows the highest expression in the testis and pancreas. Its expression in various cancers, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, suggests a role in tumorigenesis.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given the high testis expression, a potential role in male infertility could be considered, though no such association has been established. Its association with pulmonary function in a GWAS study might suggest a role in respiratory phenotypes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Specific data on developmental expression and its link to age-related phenotypes is not readily available.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function in One Sentence:** CCDC110 is a coiled-coil domain-containing protein that localizes to the nucleus and centrosomes and is involved in cell cycle regulation.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** In the context of cancer, the mechanism appears to be related to overexpression promoting cell proliferation and migration. For potential Mendelian disease, the mechanism is unknown.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** In hepatocellular carcinoma, CCDC110 interacts with and stabilizes TGFBR1, activating the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhances malignant behavior.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction between CCDC110 and TGFBR1 is critical for its role in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma progression.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for CCDC110 variants is currently zero, as it is not included in standard gene panels for specific inherited diseases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for this gene is generally not performed in a clinical diagnostic setting for inherited diseases. It is primarily a subject of cancer research.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are no clinical actionability guidelines for variants in CCDC110.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling would focus on the lack of evidence for CCDC110 in causing Mendelian disease and the uncertain significance of any identified rare variants. The reported asymptomatic deletion carriers should be noted.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 38769395, 2025:** Demonstrated that high expression of CCDC110 in hepatocellular carcinoma promotes tumor progression by activating the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD pathway through interaction with TGFBR1.\n*   **PMID: 34737220, 2021:** Reported a familial 4.5-Mb deletion at 4q35.1q35.2, including CCDC110, in asymptomatic individuals, suggesting this deletion does not cause obvious congenital defects.\n*   **PMID: 15447989, 2004:** First identified CCDC110 (as KM-HN-1) as a novel human cancer/testis antigen, recognized by both cellular and humoral immune responses, and expressed in tumors.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence associations between HPO terms and CCDC110 variants for Mendelian disorders.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are no established \"red flag\" HPO terms that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in CCDC110.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Given the lack of a defined phenotype, differential diagnosis is not applicable.

        "BMP8A": "BMP8A Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n\u2013 **HGNC ID**: 21650\n\u2013 **OMIM Gene ID**: 620847\n\u2013 **Primary Disease Associations**: No definitive monogenic disease associations have been established in OMIM or ClinVar. GeneCards lists associations with Vestibular Nystagmus and Photoallergic Dermatitis, though the evidence for these is not specified.\n\u2013 **Clinical Significance Level**: The clinical significance of BMP8A in Mendelian disease is currently uncertain.\n\u2013 **Inheritance Patterns**: No clear inheritance patterns have been described in patients for any specific disease.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\u2013 **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI of 0.00, a LOEUF of 1.18, pRec of 0.81, and pNull of 0.19.\n\u2013 **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The low pLI score (closer to 0) and high LOEUF score (greater than 1) suggest that BMP8A is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This indicates that haploinsufficiency is not a likely mechanism of disease for this gene.\n\u2013 **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be gain-of-function or have dominant-negative effects. However, there is currently no strong evidence for this.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\u2013 **Primary HPO terms**: Currently, no specific HPO terms are definitively associated with pathogenic variants in BMP8A in human patients.\n\u2013 **Secondary HPO terms**: No secondary HPO terms are currently documented in relation to BMP8A variants in humans.\n\u2013 **Age of Onset Patterns**: Not applicable as no clear disease phenotype is established.\n\u2013 **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Not applicable.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\u2013 **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: There are no established correlations between variant classes and specific phenotypes for BMP8A.\n\u2013 **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: Information on protein domain-specific phenotypes is not available.\n\u2013 **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: Not applicable.\n\u2013 **Examples**: A study on peripheral arterial disease (PAD) found a genome-wide significant association for the interaction between traffic exposure and the variant rs755249, located in the 3' UTR of BMP8A. However, this is a complex association and not a monogenic disease correlation.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n\u2013 No variants in BMP8A have been classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for a Mendelian disorder in ClinVar.\n\u2013 The variant rs755249 has been associated with peripheral arterial disease in the context of traffic exposure, but its clinical significance is listed as uncertain.\n\u2013 One missense variant, c.878G>A (p.Arg293His), is listed in ClinVar with a classification of \"uncertain significance\".\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\u2013 **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM)**: According to GeneCards, BMP8A has the highest expression in the thyroid gland. It is also expressed in the testis. Studies have noted its expression in lung and bone marrow cells.\n\u2013 **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Based on mouse models and human tissue expression, potential phenotypes could relate to male fertility (spermatogenesis, epididymal function), bone metabolism, and adipose tissue regulation. Aberrant expression has been noted in some cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and triple-negative breast cancer.\n\u2013 **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: In mice, Bmp8a is expressed in male germ cells during the initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\u2013 **Normal Gene Function**: BMP8A is a secreted signaling protein from the TGF-beta superfamily that induces cartilage and bone formation and is involved in the regulation of thermogenesis, energy balance, and spermatogenesis.\n\u2013 **Disease Mechanism**: Given the gnomAD constraint scores, haploinsufficiency is an unlikely disease mechanism. The specific mechanism for any potential disease association is unknown.\n\u2013 **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: BMP8A signals through the canonical BMP pathway by binding to type I and type II receptors, leading to the phosphorylation of SMAD transcription factors (SMAD1/5/8 and SMAD2/3). Disruption of this signaling in animal models affects fertility and metabolism.\n\u2013 **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: BMP8A interacts with BMP receptors (BMPR1A, BMPR2) and activin receptors (ACVR2A, ACVR2B, ALK4, ALK5) to initiate signaling. In mouse studies, genetic interaction with Bmp7 exacerbates spermatogenesis and epididymal defects.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\u2013 **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: The diagnostic yield for BMP8A is expected to be very low to none, as it is not currently associated with a well-defined monogenic disorder.\n\u2013 **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: Testing for this gene would primarily be on a research basis, for instance in cohorts with unexplained male infertility, metabolic disorders, or certain cancers.\n\u2013 **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: There are currently no clinical actionability guidelines for variants in BMP8A.\n\u2013 **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling would focus on the uncertainty of any findings in BMP8A, explaining that there is no established evidence to classify variants as pathogenic for a specific disease.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\u2013 **PMID: 27082954, 2016**: Reported a genome-wide significant interaction between variant rs755249 in BMP8A and traffic exposure in relation to peripheral arterial disease.\n\u2013 **PMID: 37785535, 2023**: Showed that Bmp8a deletion in zebrafish leads to obesity and fatty liver by affecting fatty acid oxidation and adipocyte differentiation via the Smad2/3 pathway.\n\u2013 **PMID: 38293126, 2024**: Found that BMP8A is upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and associated with poorer distant metastasis-free survival, enhancing cancer cell invasion and migration.\n\u2013 **PMID: 11784057, 2001**: A study in mice demonstrating that a mutation in Bmp7 worsens the spermatogenesis and epididymis phenotype of Bmp8a mutant mice, suggesting functional redundancy.\n\u2013 **PMID: 9506538, 1998**: Landmark study in mice that inactivated the Bmp8a gene, establishing its role in the maintenance of spermatogenesis and the integrity of the epididymis.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\u2013 **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: There are currently no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for BMP8A.\n\u2013 **Phenotype red flags**: No specific HPO terms are considered red flags for pathogenic variants in BMP8A at this time.\n\u2013 **Differential diagnosis considerations**: Given the expression pattern and animal model data, genes involved in male infertility (e.g., BMP8B, BMP7), congenital hypothyroidism, or disorders of bone and mineral metabolism might be considered in a differential diagnosis if a patient presents with relevant features and a variant of uncertain significance in BMP8A.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in BMP8A (1/1):\nN/A.

        "ANKRD30A": "ANKRD30A Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 17234.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 610856.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Primarily associated with breast cancer. It has also been investigated in the context of other cancers like bladder cancer and melanoma, and a potential link to myopia-related traits has been suggested.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The role of ANKRD30A in Mendelian disease is not well-established. Its primary clinical relevance is in oncology, particularly as a biomarker in breast cancer.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No clear inheritance pattern for a Mendelian disorder has been defined.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI:** 0.00.\n*   **LOEUF:** 1.29.\n*   **pRec:** Not available.\n*   **pNull:** Not available.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The pLI score of 0.00 and LOEUF score of 1.29 indicate that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variants. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Currently, there is insufficient evidence to associate specific variant classes with pathogenicity for a Mendelian phenotype. In the context of cancer, altered expression levels (down-regulation) are more significant than specific variant classes.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\nNo definitive Mendelian phenotype or associated HPO terms have been established for ANKRD30A. Its clinical association is primarily with cancer phenotypes.\n\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** None established.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** None established.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable for a Mendelian disorder. In cancer, it is studied in the context of adult-onset disease.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable for a Mendelian disorder.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific genotype-phenotype correlations for Mendelian disease are not described. In breast cancer, low ANKRD30A expression is associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a more aggressive subtype, and larger tumor size.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No specific patterns have been established that link variants in particular protein domains to distinct phenotypes.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable for Mendelian disease.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** No specific pathogenic variants are consistently linked to a Mendelian phenotype.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\nThere are no well-characterized pathogenic variants for ANKRD30A reported in ClinVar associated with a Mendelian disease phenotype. The database primarily lists variants of uncertain significance or those related to cancer predisposition with varying interpretations.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** ANKRD30A is highly and specifically expressed in breast mammary tissue and testis. This breast-specific expression is relevant to its role as a biomarker in breast cancer.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its expression pattern, altered function could theoretically lead to phenotypes in the breast or testis, but this is speculative.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression has been noted in the developing human brain, but the significance is unclear. Its primary clinical relevance is in adult-onset cancers.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The gene encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism observed in cancer is altered gene expression, specifically down-regulation. Haploinsufficiency is unlikely given the gnomAD constraint metrics. The roles of dominant-negative or gain-of-function variants have not been described for any disease.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** In breast cancer, down-regulation of ANKRD30A is associated with the activation of cell-cycle-related signaling pathways, which can promote cell proliferation. It may also be involved in estrogen signaling pathways.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** ANKRD30A contains ankyrin repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions, but specific interactions linked to a disease phenotype are not well-defined.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for ANKRD30A is not standard for diagnosing Mendelian disorders.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is primarily done in a research context, especially for breast cancer prognostication and subtyping.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** In breast cancer, low expression of ANKRD30A is associated with a poorer prognosis, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, which may guide therapeutic strategies in the future.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Currently, there are no established genetic counseling guidelines for this gene in the context of inherited diseases.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 32558282, Year: 2020:** Identified ANKRD30A as one of only 96 breast-specific transcripts in the human genome and showed its downregulation in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a poorer prognosis.\n*   **PMID: 35342777, Year: 2022:** Confirmed that low ANKRD30A expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size in triple-negative breast cancer and that a four-gene panel including ANKRD30A was significantly associated with survival.\n*   **PMID: 16675566, Year: 2006:** Described the nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of the ANKRD30A protein (NY-BR-1) in primary breast cancer and lymph node metastases.\n*   **PMID: 11313741, Year: 2001:** First cloned ANKRD30A (termed NY-BR-1) and identified its expression in breast cancer and normal mammary and testis tissue.\n*   **A dissertation by Chen, C. (2020)** provided a comprehensive review of ANKRD30A's breast-specific expression, its downregulation in ER-negative breast cancer, and its role in cell cycle signaling.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** None established. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a standardized vocabulary for human disease phenotypes, but currently, no specific HPO terms are definitively associated with variants in ANKRD30A for a Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are currently no \"red flag\" HPO terms that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in ANKRD30A is the cause of a patient's primary phenotype.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Not applicable in the context of Mendelian disease. In oncology, its expression pattern is used to help differentiate breast cancer subtypes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in ANKRD30A (1/1):\nN/A.

All reported pathogenic variants are associated with a severe neurodevelopmental phenotype.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** The de novo frameshift variant c.277del (p.Ala93Profs*11) and the de novo missense variant c.466T>C (p.Tyr156His) both resulted in severe global developmental delay, absent speech, motor delay, and intellectual disability.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.466T>C (p.Tyr156His):**\n    *   **Significance:** Likely Pathogenic.\n    *   **Phenotypes:** Severe global developmental delay (HP:0001263), Absent speech (HP:0001344), Motor delay (HP:0001270), Intellectual disability, severe (HP:0010864).\n    *   **Allele Frequency (gnomAD):** Not reported.\n*   **c.277del (p.Ala93Profs*11):**\n    *   **Significance:** Likely Pathogenic.\n    *   **Phenotypes:** Severe global developmental delay (HP:0001263), Absent speech (HP:0001344), Motor delay (HP:0001270), Intellectual disability, severe (HP:0010864).\n    *   **Allele Frequency (gnomAD):** Not reported.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx):** The gene has broad expression across many tissues, with the highest levels observed in the testis. Significant expression is also noted in the brain, which is consistent with the observed neurodevelopmental phenotype.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The prominent neurological features, such as intellectual disability and seizures, correlate well with the gene's expression in various brain regions.\n*   **Expression During Development:** While specific developmental expression data is limited, the early onset of symptoms suggests a critical role during prenatal or early postnatal development.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** FAM86B1 is a protein methyltransferase that specifically methylates the \u03b5-amino group of a conserved lysine residue in the Eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 (EEF2).\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Haploinsufficiency is the likely disease mechanism, as loss-of-function variants are associated with the phenotype and the gene is intolerant to such changes.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of FAM86B1 function leads to loss of EEF2 methylation, which may impair the regulation of protein synthesis, a crucial process for normal neuronal development and function.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** The diagnostic yield is currently unknown as FAM86B1 is a recently identified disease gene and not typically included in standard intellectual disability gene panels.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** This gene would be tested in individuals with unexplained severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and/or motor delays, particularly when initial genetic testing (e.g., chromosomal microarray) is uninformative.\n*   **Clinical Actionability:** There are currently no specific treatments for FAM86B1-related intellectual developmental disorder. Management is supportive and symptomatic, including physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as seizure management.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and the high likelihood of de novo occurrence in individuals with unaffected parents. The recurrence risk for parents of a child with a de novo pathogenic variant is low, but not zero due to the possibility of germline mosaicism.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 35140131 (2022):** This study identified de novo heterozygous missense and loss-of-function variants in FAM86B1 in two individuals, establishing the gene's link to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder (MRT73). Key phenotypes included severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and motor delay.\n*   **PMID: 34999859 (2022):** This research characterized FAM86B1 as the enzyme responsible for methylating lysine-525 in EEF2, providing a molecular basis for its function and the potential pathway disrupted in the associated disease.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Both loss-of-function and missense variants in FAM86B1 are strongly associated with a core phenotype of severe global developmental delay (HP:0001263), severe intellectual disability (HP:0010864), and delayed or absent speech (HP:0000750).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The combination of severe, early-onset global developmental delay with motor deficits and lack of speech should prompt consideration of pathogenic variants in FAM86B1, especially after more common causes have been excluded.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of MRT73 overlaps with numerous other monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders. Genes involved in other forms of autosomal dominant intellectual disability should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in FAM86B1 (1/1):\nN/A.
