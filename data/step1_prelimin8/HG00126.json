                "description": "CAPN3 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** CAPN3 (HGNC:1480).\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 114240.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy autosomal recessive 1 (LGMDR1, formerly LGMD2A) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy autosomal dominant 4 (LGMDD4).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between *CAPN3* and autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A is classified as \"Definitive\" and \"Strong\".\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Primarily autosomal recessive. An autosomal dominant pattern associated with a milder, later-onset phenotype has also been described.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** In gnomAD v2.1.1, *CAPN3* has a pLI score of 0.00, a pRec score of 0.99, and a pNull score of 9.2e-13. The LOEUF score is 1.25.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variants in the heterozygous state, which is consistent with its primary recessive inheritance pattern. The high pRec score suggests the gene is intolerant to homozygous loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) are established pathogenic mechanisms for the recessive form. Missense mutations are also very common. Specific in-frame deletions and missense variants have been associated with the dominant form.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Proximal muscle weakness (HP:0003701).\n    *   Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (HP:0003236).\n    *   Limb-girdle muscle weakness (HP:0006785).\n    *   Scapular winging (HP:0003691).\n    *   Waddling gait (HP:0002515).\n    *   Difficulty walking (HP:0002355).\n    *   Myopathy (HP:0003198).\n    *   Gait disturbance (HP:0001288).\n    *   Achilles tendon contracture (HP:0001771).\n    *   Calf muscle hypertrophy (HP:0008952).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Myalgia (HP:0003326).\n    *   Flexion contracture (HP:0001371).\n    *   Scoliosis (HP:0002650).\n    *   Distal muscle weakness (HP:0002460).\n    *   Exercise intolerance (HP:0003546).\n    *   Loss of ambulation (HP:0002505).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset for the recessive form (LGMDR1) is typically in late childhood or early adolescence, often between ages 6 and 18. The dominant form (LGMDD4) has a later onset, with an average age of 34 years. Asymptomatic hyper-CK-emia can be a pre-symptomatic finding in children.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity is variable. The recessive form generally leads to loss of ambulation within 20-30 years of onset. The dominant form is typically milder. Null mutations are generally associated with a more severe phenotype.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous or compound heterozygous null variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) are generally associated with a more severe phenotype and complete loss of calpain-3 protein. Patients with at least one missense mutation may have a less severe course.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Pathogenic missense mutations are frequently located in the protease domain (domain II) and domain III. Variants near the calmodulin-binding site have been associated with the autosomal dominant form.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Moderate. While some general correlations exist, such as null variants leading to more severe disease, significant phenotypic variability is observed even among individuals with the same mutations.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   The c.643_663del21 in-frame deletion is associated with autosomal dominant LGMDD4, characterized by later onset, myalgia, and a generally milder phenotype.\n    *   Compound heterozygosity for the c.1746-20C>G variant along with another pathogenic variant often results in a mild-to-moderate phenotype.\n    *   The 2362AG->TCATCT mutation (exon 22) is a frequent cause of LGMDR1 but does not appear to be a specific risk factor for wheelchair dependence at a certain age.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.550delA (p.Thr184Argfs*36) / rs80338814 / Pathogenic /** LGMDR1, proximal muscle weakness, elevated CK.

There is typically no cardiac involvement or intellectual disability.\n*   **Expression During Development:** *CAPN3* is believed to play a role in the early stages of myogenesis (muscle formation) and muscle remodeling.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *CAPN3* encodes calpain-3, a calcium-dependent, non-lysosomal cysteine protease specific to skeletal muscle that plays a role in muscle protein turnover, sarcomere maintenance, and muscle remodeling.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism for recessive LGMDR1 is loss-of-function. For the dominant LGMDD4 associated with the c.643_663del21 variant, a dominant-negative effect on the calpain-3 homodimer has been proposed.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   Disruption of calpain-3's proteolytic activity may lead to the accumulation of damaged proteins and dysregulation of protein turnover in muscle.\n    *   *CAPN3* deficiency can lead to degradation of SERCA proteins, impairing calcium homeostasis and storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n    *   Loss of function can dysregulate the NF-\u03baB pathway, potentially leading to protein degradation, inflammation, and fibrosis in skeletal muscle.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Calpain-3 binds to titin (TTN), a giant protein essential for sarcomere structure and elasticity, which localizes calpain-3 to the sarcomere. This interaction is critical for muscle function and maintenance.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In cohorts of patients with suspected limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, *CAPN3* is one of the most frequently mutated genes, accounting for 17% to 30% of solved cases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** This gene is tested in individuals presenting with progressive proximal muscle weakness, particularly of the shoulder and pelvic girdles, often with scapular winging and elevated serum CK levels.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Management is supportive and includes physical therapy and stretching to maintain mobility and prevent contractures. Genetic diagnosis confirms the specific subtype of LGMD, which is crucial for prognosis and genetic counseling.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Autosomal recessive LGMDR1 carriers are typically asymptomatic. The identification of a dominantly acting *CAPN3* variant has significant implications for genetic counseling, as affected individuals have a 50% chance of passing the condition to their children.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Richard et al. (1995) (PMID: 7720071):** Landmark paper that first identified mutations in the muscle-specific calpain (*CAPN3*) gene as the cause of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A.\n*   **S\u00e1enz et al. (2005) (PMID: 15625251):** A large study of 238 LGMD2A patients that characterized the mutational spectrum and genotype-phenotype correlations, noting a mean onset age of 14 and that mutation type did not clearly correlate with the age of wheelchair dependence.\n*   **Vissing et al. (2016) (PMID: 27259757):** First major study to provide strong evidence for a dominantly inherited form of calpainopathy (LGMDD4) caused by a specific 21-bp in-frame deletion in *CAPN3*, expanding the known inheritance patterns.\n*   **Nallamilli et al. (2018) (PMID: 30127038):** A large US-based study that found *CAPN3* to be the most common gene implicated in their LGMD cohort (17% of cases) and noted an increased prevalence of dominantly inherited forms.\n*   **Reddy et al. (2021) (PMID: 33246816):** A comprehensive study on an Indian cohort that identified 71 novel mutations, highlighting population-specific mutation distribution and observing a slower disease progression compared to European populations.\n*   **Zhang et al. (2021) (PMID: 33964115):** A case study reporting compound heterozygous variants, including a novel deletion, and emphasizing the role of nonsense-mediated decay as a pathogenic mechanism.\n*   **Jalali et al. (2023) (PMID: 36778401):** A recent case report identifying a novel homozygous missense variant (p.Gly221Cys) using WES, demonstrating the continued discovery of new pathogenic variants.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   Biallelic loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) are strongly associated with the classic LGMDR1 phenotype: Limb-girdle muscle weakness (HP:0006785), Proximal muscle weakness (HP:0003701), Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (HP:0003236), and Scapular winging (HP:0003691).\n    *   The heterozygous c.643_663del21 variant is strongly associated with later-onset LGMDD4, with Myalgia (HP:0003326) and back pain being prominent features.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of progressive, symmetric proximal muscle weakness (pelvic and shoulder girdles), prominent scapular winging, and highly elevated CK levels in a patient with a normal heart function and intellect is highly suggestive of a *CAPN3*-related myopathy.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The clinical presentation of calpainopathy can overlap with other limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, such as those caused by mutations in *DYSF* (LGMDR2), *ANO5* (LGMDR12), and *FKRP* (LGMDR9). It can also occasionally mimic facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) or distal myopathies.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in CAPN3 (1/1):\nN/A.

                "description": "PFKM Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** PFKM (HGNC:8877)\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 610681\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Glycogen storage disease type VII (GSDVII), also known as Tarui disease (OMIM: 232800).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Definitive. Biallelic pathogenic variants in PFKM are the established cause of GSDVII.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** GSDVII is an autosomal recessive disorder.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    *   pLI (Probability of being Loss-of-function Intolerant): 0.01 (gnomAD v2.1.1)\n    *   LOEUF (Loss-of-function Observed/Expected Upper bound Fraction): 1.15 (gnomAD v2.1.1)\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI score and high LOEUF score indicate that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This is consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, where heterozygous carriers are typically asymptomatic.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Pathogenicity arises from biallelic variants, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations, that result in a nonfunctional or severely impaired enzyme.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0003236 Exercise intolerance\n    *   HP:0001265 Myalgia\n    *   HP:0002878 Myoglobinuria\n    *   HP:0001890 Hemolytic anemia\n    *   HP:0001541 Myopathy\n    *   HP:0003208 Hyperuricemia\n    *   HP:0003198 Rhabdomyolysis\n    *   HP:0001270 Motor delay\n    *   HP:0001324 Muscle weakness\n    *   HP:0001947 Jaundice\n    *   HP:0002240 Hepatomegaly\n    *   HP:0002616 Splenomegaly\n    *   HP:0001878 Reticulocytosis\n    *   HP:0000286 High palate\n    *   HP:0003391 Muscle cramps\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001638 Cardiomyopathy\n    *   HP:0001511 Intrauterine growth retardation\n    *   HP:0001622 Premature birth\n    *   HP:0000407 Sensory axonal neuropathy\n    *   HP:0001263 Global developmental delay\n    *   HP:0002014 Diarrhea\n    *   HP:0002027 Abdominal pain\n    *   HP:0002017 Nausea and vomiting\n    *   HP:0000789 Inguinal hernia\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The classic form typically presents in childhood or adolescence with exercise-induced symptoms. A severe, infantile-onset form can present with progressive weakness, hypotonia, and early death. A late-onset form with mild, fixed weakness may also occur.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity is highly variable, ranging from mild, compensated hemolysis and exercise intolerance to severe infantile-onset myopathy leading to early death.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygosity for null mutations (e.g., frameshift, nonsense, or major rearrangements) that completely abolish enzyme activity is often associated with the severe, lethal infantile form of GSDVII. Compound heterozygotes with one null allele and one missense allele may have variable presentations.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Mutations in the allosteric binding sites, such as the D543A variant, can disrupt the enzyme's regulation by ATP, leading to a classic GSDVII phenotype. No strong, consistent genotype-phenotype correlations have been established for most variants.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Generally considered weak to moderate, as significant clinical heterogeneity is observed even within families sharing the same mutations. While biallelic null mutations often lead to a severe outcome, the phenotypic expression of missense variants is less predictable.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.2065G>A (p.Gly689Arg):** Pathogenic; associated with classic GSDVII phenotypes including exercise intolerance and hemolysis.\n*   **c.1628A>C (p.Asp543Ala) / rs121918194:** Conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity; located in an activating binding site, disrupts allosteric regulation, associated with classic GSDVII. AF (gnomAD): 0.00002.\n*   **IVS5+1G>A:** Pathogenic; a splice-site mutation common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, results in a nonfunctional protein and classic GSDVII.\n*   **c.1416+1G>A (IVS12+1G>A):** Pathogenic; a common splice-site mutation leading to exon skipping and a severely truncated, inactive enzyme.\n*   **c.1127G>A (p.Arg376Gln) / rs187131358:** Uncertain significance; reported in GSDVII cases but functional impact is not fully defined. AF (gnomAD): 0.00001.\n*   **c.1376G>A (p.Arg459His):** Novel variant reported as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in a compound heterozygous state, associated with muscle weakness and hemolysis.\n*   **c.626G>A (p.Arg209His):** Novel variant reported as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in a compound heterozygous state, associated with muscle weakness and hemolysis.\n*   **c.926A>G (p.Asp309Gly):** Pathogenic; predicted to severely affect enzyme catalysis, leading to classic GSDVII symptoms.\n*   **c.1087C>T (p.Arg363Cys):** Pathogenic; associated with late-onset myopathy.\n*   **c.2224delG (p.Val742fs):** Pathogenic; a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon and a nonfunctional protein.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** Skeletal muscle shows the highest expression of PFKM, which directly correlates with the primary phenotype of exertional myopathy and exercise intolerance.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:**\n    *   **Muscle:** Deficiency of the M-subunit tetramer (PFK-M4) causes a block in glycolysis, leading to ATP depletion during exercise, cramps, and myoglobinuria.\n    *   **Erythrocytes:** Red blood cells express a combination of M and L (liver) subunits; deficiency of the M subunit leads to partial enzyme deficiency, cell instability, and compensated hemolytic anemia.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Expression patterns during development are critical, and defects can lead to the severe infantile-onset form of the disease with early lethality.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The PFKM gene encodes the muscle-specific isoform of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), a key enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate in glycolysis.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary disease mechanism is a loss-of-function, consistent with its autosomal recessive inheritance. Biallelic mutations lead to deficient or absent PFK-M subunit activity.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Glycolysis Blockade:** In muscle, the inability to perform glycolysis blocks the primary pathway for ATP generation from glucose during intense exercise, causing energy deficiency, accumulation of upstream glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate, and exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis.\n    *   **Erythrocyte Metabolism:** In red blood cells, the partial enzyme defect impairs glycolysis, leading to reduced ATP and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate levels, which increases hemoglobin's oxygen affinity and promotes hemolysis.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** PFKM subunits homotetramerize to form the active enzyme in muscle (PFK-M4). In erythrocytes, PFKM and PFKL subunits form heterotetramers; the lack of functional PFKM subunits disrupts the stability and function of these complexes.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** Genetic testing via whole-exome or genome sequencing in patients with a clinical suspicion of GSDVII has a high diagnostic yield, often identifying biallelic pathogenic variants in PFKM.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** The most common indications for testing are exercise intolerance starting in childhood, exertional myalgia, myoglobinuria, and the combination of myopathy with compensated hemolytic anemia.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Management is primarily supportive, including avoidance of strenuous exercise. A high-protein or ketogenic diet may provide alternative energy sources for muscle. Monitoring for hemolytic episodes and renal function (due to myoglobinuria risk) is crucial.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal/preimplantation genetic diagnosis are options for families with known pathogenic variants.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 3901988 (1985):** A landmark study describing the molecular basis of the disease in Ashkenazi Jewish patients, identifying a common splicing mutation.\n*   **PMID: 8527230 (1995):** Characterized the PFKM gene structure and identified several mutations, helping to establish the genetic basis and heterogeneity of Tarui disease.\n*   **PMID: 19707255 (2009):** Described the generation of a Pfkm-deficient mouse model, which recapitulated key features of human GSDVII including exercise intolerance, hemolysis, and early death in severe cases, providing insights into the systemic nature of the disease.\n*   **PMID: 2602744 (1990):** Reported on the diversity of mutations in the PFKM gene, including deletions and single nucleotide changes, expanding the known variant spectrum.\n*   **PMID: 38830768 (2024):** A recent case report identifying two novel compound heterozygous mutations (c.1376G>A and c.626G>A) via WGS/WES in a patient with GSDVII, highlighting the ongoing discovery of new variants and the clinical utility of comprehensive genomic testing.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Biallelic null variants (frameshift, nonsense, canonical splice site) are strongly associated with a severe phenotype that can include infantile onset (HP:0003593), progressive muscle weakness (HP:0003323), and early death. The IVS5+1G>A variant is strongly associated with classic GSDVII in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, presenting with exercise intolerance (HP:0003236), myalgia (HP:0001265), and hemolytic anemia (HP:0001890).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis (HP:0003198) or myoglobinuria (HP:0002878) with evidence of compensated hemolysis (e.g., reticulocytosis HP:0001878, elevated indirect bilirubin) is highly suggestive of pathogenic variants in PFKM.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The myopathic features overlap with other glycogen storage diseases, particularly McArdle disease (GSDV, caused by PYGM variants), and other metabolic myopathies. The hemolytic anemia component distinguishes GSDVII from many other GSDs and should prompt consideration of red cell enzymopathies like pyruvate kinase deficiency.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PFKM (2/2):\nN/A.

The recessive nature of IGHMBP2 disorders suggests it is not haploinsufficient, but biallelic loss-of-function is pathogenic.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:**\n    *   Loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site) are commonly pathogenic.\n    *   Missense variants, particularly when located in the helicase domain, are frequently associated with the severe SMARD1 phenotype.\n    *   The complete loss-of-function of the IGHMBP2 gene is thought to be a primary cause of SMARD1.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001262: Distal muscle weakness.\n    *   HP:0001270: Motor delay.\n    *   HP:0002094: Respiratory insufficiency due to muscle weakness.\n    *   HP:0003324: Diaphragmatic paralysis/paresis.\n    *   HP:0001284: Areflexia.\n    *   HP:0001265: Hyporeflexia.\n    *   HP:0003477: Distal amyotrophy.\n    *   HP:0002515: Foot deformity.\n    *   HP:0001765: Pes cavus.\n    *   HP:0007256: Axonal neuropathy.\n    *   HP:0002875: Respiratory failure.\n    *   HP:0001511: Intrauterine growth retardation.\n    *   HP:0002194: Delayed gross motor development.\n    *   HP:0001250: Seizures.\n    *   HP:0001635: Cardiomyopathy.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001263: Global developmental delay.\n    *   HP:0100521: Intellectual disability.\n    *   HP:0001643: Patent ductus arteriosus.\n    *   HP:0001629: Ventricular septal defect.\n    *   HP:0009830: Peripheral neuropathy.\n    *   HP:0003202: Sensorineural hearing impairment.\n    *   HP:0002750: Delayed skeletal maturation.\n    *   HP:0003236: Anhidrosis/Hypohidrosis.\n    *   HP:0000545: Myopia.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:**\n    *   **Infantile:** SMARD1 typically presents in infancy, between 6 weeks and 6 months of age, with acute respiratory distress.\n    *   **Childhood:** CMT2S usually presents in the first decade with a slowly progressive neuropathy. Later-onset SMARD1 cases have also been reported.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:**\n    *   **Severe:** The classic SMARD1 phenotype is severe and often fatal in infancy due to respiratory failure.\n    *   **Moderate/Mild:** CMT2S follows a milder clinical course without primary respiratory involvement. A clinical spectrum exists, with some patients having atypical or intermediate phenotypes.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   Mutations associated with SMARD1 are frequently missense variants located within the helicase domain. Biallelic null mutations (e.g., two truncating variants) are strongly associated with the severe SMARD1 phenotype.\n    *   The CMT2S phenotype is often caused by a combination of a nonsense or frameshift mutation in the 5' region and a truncating, missense, or homozygous frameshift mutation in the last exon.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:**\n    *   Most pathogenic mutations are located in the helicase and R3H domains. Variants in the helicase domain are often linked to severe clinical phenotypes due to their impact on ATPase activity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:**\n    *   **Strong:** There is a strong correlation between the type and location of IGHMBP2 variants and the resulting clinical phenotype (SMARD1 vs. CMT2S). This correlation is linked to the level of residual IGHMBP2 protein function.\n    *   CMT2S patients have significantly higher residual IGHMBP2 protein levels compared to SMARD1 patients.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   Compound heterozygous variants c.1235+3A>G and c.1334A>C have been reported in patients with both SMARD1 and CMT2S, suggesting the influence of other genetic or environmental modifiers.\n    *   A homozygous frameshift variant c.2568_2569del (p.Gly857Alafs*27) resulted in CMT2S without respiratory distress.\n    *   Compound heterozygosity for a frameshift c.407_408del and a missense c.1737C>A (p.F579L) was identified in a patient with SMARD1.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **Pathogenic Variants (Examples):**\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.407_408del (p.Ala140Glnfs*1) / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.1737C>A (p.Phe579Leu) / **Significance:** Uncertain Significance, but reported in SMARD1 patients / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.2568_2569del (p.Gly857Alafs*27) / **Significance:** Pathogenic (novel) / **Phenotypes:** CMT2S, progressive sensorimotor neuropathy, absent deep tendon reflexes.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.1235+3A>G / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1, CMT2S.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.1334A>C (p.His445Pro) / **Significance:** Likely Pathogenic / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1, CMT2S.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.1574T>C (p.Leu525Pro) / **Significance:** Pathogenic (novel) / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.1813C>T (p.Arg605Ter) / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1, CMT2S.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.2623C>T (p.Arg788Ter) / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Phenotypes:** CMT2S.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** Biallelic null or helicase domain missense variants are strongly associated with SMARD1. According to ClinVar, there are over 140 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants reported in IGHMBP2.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** IGHMBP2 is ubiquitously expressed, but the highest expression levels are observed in the brain and spinal cord.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in motor neurons is consistent with the primary pathology of SMARD1 and CMT2S, which involves the degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons and peripheral nerves. Pathological symptoms are largely restricted to neural and muscle tissue.\n*   **Expression During Development:** IGHMBP2 is critical for the development and maintenance of the nervous system, particularly for the survival of motor neurons.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** IGHMBP2 encodes a 5' to 3' ATP-dependent helicase that unwinds DNA and RNA and is involved in transcription, ribosome biogenesis, and translation.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary disease mechanism is loss-of-function. The severity of the disease (SMARD1 vs. CMT2S) correlates inversely with the amount of residual IGHMBP2 protein.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   Disruption of IGHMBP2's role in the translational machinery, including its physical association with tRNAs and ribosomal proteins, is thought to underlie motor neuron degeneration.\n    *   Loss of IGHMBP2 modestly reduces global translation and leads to chronic activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) pathway, a cellular response implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** IGHMBP2 interacts with components of the translational machinery, including ABT1 (required for ribosome biogenesis), and transcription factor IIIC.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In patients with diseases related to IGHMBP2 mutations, SMARD1 is the more commonly identified phenotype, accounting for approximately 71% of cases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:**\n    *   Infants presenting with acute respiratory failure, diaphragmatic paralysis, and distal muscle weakness, especially if SMN1 testing is negative.\n    *   Children with a progressive, axonal, sensorimotor neuropathy consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:**\n    *   Diagnosis is critical for management, which includes respiratory support (often mechanical ventilation for SMARD1), physical therapy, and nutritional support.\n    *   Gene therapy approaches using AAV9 vectors to deliver functional IGHMBP2 have shown promise in mouse models, extending lifespan and improving motor function.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling for autosomal recessive inheritance is indicated. Given the significant phenotypic variability, even between siblings with the same mutations, predicting the precise clinical course can be challenging.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 40353295 (2025):** Expands the known clinical and genetic spectrum of IGHMBP2 disorders, highlights genotype-phenotype correlations between SMARD1 and AR-CMT2S, and identifies novel variants.\n*   **PMID: 38472481 (2024):** Review describing the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying IGHMBP2-related neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing its helicase function in multiple cellular processes.\n*   **PMID: 38813354 (2024):** Case report of a novel homozygous frameshift variant (c.2568_2569del) causing CMT2S, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of IGHMBP2-related disease.\n*   **PMID: 38817757 (2024):** Reports on SMARD1 caused by compound heterozygous variants (c.407_408del and c.1737C>A), highlighting the correlation between residual protein levels and clinical severity.\n*   **PMID: 38352697 (2024):** First report of IGHMBP2 disorders in Vietnam, identifying a novel variant (p.Leu525Pro) and observing different phenotypes (SMARD1 vs. CMT2S) in patients with the same genotype, suggesting the role of genetic modifiers.\n*   **PMID: 37974917 (2023):** Systematic review finding that SMARD1 accounts for 71% of IGHMBP2-related disease and that complete loss-of-function is likely the mechanism for severe SMARD1.\n*   **PMID: 36070005 (2022):** Used a yeast model to validate the pathogenicity of IGHMBP2 missense variants, showing a correlation between in-vitro functional impairment and clinical phenotype.\n*   **PMID: 19158098 (2009):** Landmark study providing biochemical evidence for the role of IGHMBP2 in the translational machinery through its association with tRNAs and ribosome biogenesis factors.\n*   **Grohmann et al. (2001) *(not in provided search results, but historically significant)*:** First identified IGHMBP2 as the causative gene for SMARD1.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:**\n    *   Biallelic null mutations (frameshift, nonsense) or compound heterozygosity with a severe missense variant in the helicase domain strongly predicts a SMARD1 phenotype, characterized by early-onset respiratory failure (HP:0002875), diaphragmatic paralysis (HP:0003324), and distal amyotrophy (HP:0003477).\n    *   Compound heterozygous variants with predicted higher residual protein function (e.g., specific missense/splice variants or a null variant combined with a less severe allele) are associated with the milder CMT2S phenotype, primarily featuring axonal neuropathy (HP:0007256) and distal muscle weakness (HP:0001262) without significant respiratory distress.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:**\n    *   The combination of infantile-onset (HP:0003593) acute respiratory distress (HP:0002094) with symmetrical distal muscle weakness (HP:0001262) is highly suggestive of SMARD1 and warrants immediate IGHMBP2 testing if SMN1 is normal.\n    *   Progressive distal limb weakness and atrophy with areflexia beginning in childhood is a strong indicator for CMT2S.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**\n    *   **Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA):** Caused by SMN1 mutations. SMARD1 should be considered when SMA testing is negative in a patient with a compatible phenotype.\n    *   **Other Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) subtypes:** Axonal CMT has extensive genetic heterogeneity; overlapping phenotypes require broad gene panel testing or exome sequencing.\n    *   **Congenital Myopathies, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, and Mitochondrial Myopathy:** These should be considered in the differential for infants and children with significant muscle weakness and/or respiratory failure.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in IGHMBP2 (2/2):\nN/A.

                "description": "BSN Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: BSN**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 1117.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 604020.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Bassoon-related neurodevelopmental disorder, which can include epilepsy, developmental delay, behavioral phenotypes, and obesity. Other reported associations include epilepsy with a favorable outcome and a progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between BSN variants and epilepsy has been evaluated as \"strong\" based on the ClinGen framework.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Autosomal dominant inheritance, often arising de novo, is observed for protein-truncating variants. Autosomal recessive inheritance involving compound heterozygous variants has also been reported.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint scores for BSN (transcript NM_003458.3) are pLI = 1.00, pNull = 0, pRec = 0. The LOEUF is 0.08 (90% CI 0.04-0.15).\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A pLI score of \u22650.9 is considered extremely intolerant of loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The BSN pLI score of 1.00 and very low LOEUF score strongly indicate that the gene is haploinsufficient and does not tolerate the loss of one functional copy.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Protein-truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift) are a primary class of pathogenic variants, consistent with haploinsufficiency. Missense variants, both de novo and in compound heterozygous states, have also been reported as pathogenic.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n    *   Febrile seizure (HP:0002373).\n    *   Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).\n    *   Obesity (HP:0001513).\n    *   Behavioral disinhibition (p=3.39e-17 association).\n    *   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (HP:0007018).\n    *   Autistic behavior (HP:0000729).\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (HP:0002069).\n    *   Focal-onset seizure (HP:0007359).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Adult-onset severe obesity.\n    *   Type 2 diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978).\n    *   Hepatic steatosis (HP:0001397).\n    *   Progressive supranuclear ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000641).\n    *   Postural instability (HP:0002172).\n    *   Cognitive decline (HP:0100543).\n    *   Microcephaly (HP:0000252).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically in infancy or childhood for epilepsy and neurodevelopmental phenotypes. A distinct adult-onset phenotype including obesity and a neurodegenerative PSP-like syndrome has also been described.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype is broad, ranging from individuals with mild features or favorable-outcome epilepsy to those with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Adults may present with a milder neurodevelopmental phenotype or no obvious neurodevelopmental features.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** De novo protein-truncating variants (PTVs) are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by epilepsy, developmental delay, obesity, and behavioral issues. Biallelic missense variants have been linked to a more severe epileptic phenotype with neurodevelopmental delay.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Pathogenic missense variants causing epilepsy with a favorable outcome have been reported to cluster at the C-terminus of the Bassoon protein, suggesting a specific subregional effect.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Evidence suggests a moderate correlation, where the severity and type of phenotype can be linked to the variant type (e.g., monoallelic missense vs. biallelic missense vs. truncating variants).\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** Biallelic variants, including a deletion (p.Leu1454del) and a missense variant (p.Ala3642Val), were associated with frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delay, and microcephaly. Monoallelic missense variants were associated with benign epilepsy.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   This section requires a comprehensive table populated from ClinVar and literature, which is beyond the scope of a static summary. Representative examples are provided below based on available search results.\n*   **c.3322G>T (p.Glu1108Ter):** De novo nonsense variant; reported in a patient with infantile-onset epilepsy with febrile seizures but normal development.\n*   **c.7351C>T (p.Gln2451Ter):** De novo nonsense variant; reported in a patient with childhood-onset epilepsy, febrile seizures, and normal development.\n*   **p.Pro3520Leu & p.Thr3658Ser:** Two separate heterozygous missense variants; associated with epilepsy with a favorable outcome.\n*   **p.Leu1454del & p.Ala3642Val:** Compound heterozygous variants; associated with frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delay, and microcephalus.\n*   **MyGene2 Candidate 4093:** De novo variant of unknown type; listed as \"Suspected pathogenic\".\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** BSN is highly expressed in the brain, with highest expression levels in the cerebellum, cerebellar hemisphere, cortex, and caudate nucleus. This aligns with the provided existing data.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high and specific expression in multiple brain regions, including the cortex and hippocampus, is consistent with the observed neurological phenotypes such as epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and behavioral disorders.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** BSN expression is significantly higher during infancy and decreases in adolescence and adulthood, which may correlate with the typical infancy/childhood onset of epilepsy.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** BSN encodes Bassoon, a large scaffolding protein that organizes the presynaptic cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) to regulate synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Haploinsufficiency due to protein-truncating variants is a primary mechanism, leading to a loss of function. Some missense variants may also lead to loss of function, while others could have dominant-negative effects.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the presynaptic active zone impairs the integrity and function of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, leading to cortical hyperexcitability and seizures. In a separate mechanism, mutated BSN has been shown to lose its ability to reduce tau protein accumulation, potentially leading to tauopathy and neurodegeneration.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Bassoon functions in a complex with other CAZ proteins like Piccolo, Munc13, and RIMs. Its interaction with P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels is crucial for normal neurotransmitter release.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The exact diagnostic yield is not specified in the search results, but BSN is an emerging candidate gene found in epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorder cohorts via large-scale sequencing.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for BSN variants is indicated in individuals with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those with epilepsy (especially infantile or childhood-onset), developmental delay, and behavioral abnormalities.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** A genetic diagnosis can help predict the clinical course, with some genotypes suggesting a more favorable epilepsy outcome. Management is currently symptomatic, focusing on seizure control and supportive therapies for developmental delays.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the variable expressivity and wide phenotypic spectrum. Inheritance patterns can be autosomal dominant (often de novo) or recessive, impacting recurrence risk counseling for families.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 38896942 (2025):** Established that de novo disruptive BSN variants cause a synaptic disorder with a broad neurodevelopmental phenotype including epilepsy, developmental delay, obesity, and behavioral issues in a cohort of 29 individuals.\n*   **PMID: 32620603 (2020):** Identified BSN variants in eight families with epilepsy, suggesting a favorable outcome for many. It established the gene-disease relationship as \"strong\" and reported both de novo and recessive inheritance patterns, correlating phenotype severity with genotype.\n*   **PMID: 34168087 (2021):** Linked protein-truncating variants in BSN to severe adult-onset obesity, type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver disease, expanding the phenotype to include metabolic disorders.\n*   **PMID: 29335607 (2018):** Reported missense mutations in BSN in a family with a progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)-like syndrome, identifying a novel tauopathy and linking BSN to neurodegenerative disease through impaired reduction of tau accumulation.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   De novo protein-truncating variants are strongly associated with a phenotype that includes Seizures (HP:0001250), Global developmental delay (HP:0001263), and Obesity (HP:0001513).\n    *   Biallelic missense variants are associated with a more severe epilepsy phenotype and Microcephaly (HP:0000252).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of infantile/childhood-onset epilepsy (especially with febrile seizures), significant behavioral issues like disinhibition, and emerging obesity should raise strong suspicion for a pathogenic variant in BSN.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype overlaps with numerous other genetic causes of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Genes involved in presynaptic function and other forms of genetic epilepsy should be considered.\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in BSN (2/2):\nN/A.

Heterozygous missense mutations are the most common cause of the dominant form.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Nephrocalcinosis (HP:0000121)\n    *   Hypercalciuria (HP:0003471)\n    *   Hypophosphatemia (HP:0002148)\n    *   Nephrolithiasis (HP:0000787)\n    *   Hypercalcemia (HP:0003072)\n    *   Renal phosphate wasting / Hyperphosphaturia (HP:0003108 / HP:0002908)\n    *   Failure to thrive (HP:0001508)\n    *   Decreased bone mineral density (HP:0000938)\n    *   Osteoporosis (HP:0000939)\n    *   Proximal tubulopathy (HP:0001970)\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Vomiting (HP:0002013)\n    *   Polyuria (HP:0000103)\n    *   Metabolic acidosis (HP:0001942)\n    *   Hypophosphatemic rickets (HP:0008898)\n    *   Bone pain (HP:0002653)\n    *   Dehydration (HP:0001944)\n*   **Age of Onset:** Onset can be in infancy with severe symptoms like failure to thrive and hypercalcemia. Alternatively, presentation can be in adulthood with nephrolithiasis or osteoporosis.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity is highly variable, even within families. Biallelic mutations are associated with a more severe, early-onset phenotype compared to monoallelic mutations. Digenic inheritance of heterozygous mutations in both *SLC34A1* and *SLC34A3* can result in a more severe phenotype than a single heterozygous mutation.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Biallelic Variants:** Typically cause autosomal recessive infantile hypercalcemia or Fanconi-like syndrome with severe renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and subsequent hypercalcemia.\n*   **Monoallelic Variants:** Cause a milder, autosomal dominant phenotype of hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis and/or osteoporosis, often presenting in adulthood.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Strong. There is a clear distinction between the severe, recessive phenotypes caused by biallelic mutations and the milder, dominant phenotypes caused by heterozygous mutations.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   **p.I456N (heterozygous):** Associated with autosomal dominant renal stone disease.\n    *   **p.R512C and p.V91A97del (compound heterozygous):** Associated with an autosomal recessive Fanconi-like syndrome with metabolic acidosis and renal stones.\n    *   **p.Gly543Cys (heterozygous):** A novel variant associated with recurrent nephrolithiasis and early-onset osteopenia.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n| HGVS / rsID | ClinVar Significance | Reported Phenotypes (HPO Terms) | Allele Frequency (gnomAD) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| p.Val408Glu / rs140649226 | Pathogenic | Hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis 1, Infantile hypercalcemia 2 | 0.00011 |\n| p.Ile456Asn | Pathogenic | Hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis | Not reported |\n| p.Arg512Cys / rs769018485 | Pathogenic | Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 | Very rare |\n| p.V91_A97del | Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic | Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 | More common |\n| p.Arg512His / rs199679198 | Pathogenic | Hypophosphatemic rickets, Hypercalciuria | 0.000008 |\n| p.Gly543Cys | Uncertain Significance | Nephrolithiasis, Osteopenia | Not reported |\n| p.Thr138Met | Pathogenic | Infantile hypercalcemia 2 | Not reported |\n| p.Val147Met | Pathogenic | Infantile hypercalcemia 2 | Not reported |\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues:** The highest expression of *SLC34A1* is in the kidney cortex, according to GTEx data.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes:** The kidney-specific expression of the NaPi-IIa protein explains why phenotypes are primarily renal, including defective phosphate reabsorption, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Clinical presentations in early infancy suggest the gene is critical for phosphate homeostasis from birth.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The *SLC34A1* gene encodes the sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter 2A (NaPi-IIa), which is critical for reabsorbing phosphate from the glomerular filtrate in the kidney's proximal tubule.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:**\n    *   **Recessive (Loss-of-Function):** Biallelic mutations lead to a loss of NaPi-IIa transporter function, causing renal phosphate wasting. This results in hypophosphatemia, which stimulates 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 production, leading to increased intestinal calcium absorption and subsequent hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.\n    *   **Dominant:** The mechanism for dominant disease is less clear but may involve trafficking defects or a dominant-negative effect where the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** The primary pathway disrupted is sodium-coupled phosphate transport in the renal brush border membrane. This dysregulation of phosphate homeostasis has downstream effects on the vitamin D metabolic pathway.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** In a cohort of patients with a history suggestive of hypersensitivity to vitamin D (hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria), mutations in *SLC34A1* were identified in 1-8% of cases, less frequently than *CYP24A1* mutations.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** The gene is tested in cases of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia, Fanconi syndrome, and unexplained hypophosphatemia, nephrolithiasis, or early-onset osteoporosis.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management:** Management is often personalized due to phenotype variability. It includes hyperhydration, dietary modifications (low sodium, appropriate calcium), and potentially phosphate supplementation, which can rapidly resolve hypercalcemia in infants with biallelic mutations.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Both autosomal recessive and dominant inheritance must be considered. Heterozygous carriers of a recessive allele may be asymptomatic or have mild biochemical changes. The possibility of digenic inheritance with *SLC34A3* should be considered in complex cases.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n| PMID / DOI | Year | Key Phenotype Findings |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 26047794 | 2016 | Established that biallelic, autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in *SLC34A1* cause idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia (IIH), characterized by renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and hypercalcemia. |\n| 29924459 | 2018 | Detailed cases illustrating both autosomal dominant (hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis) and autosomal recessive (Fanconi-like syndrome) phenotypes, linking them to specific mutations and cellular trafficking defects. |\n| 28470390 | 2017 | Described a family with digenic heterozygous mutations in *SLC34A1* and *SLC34A3* causing a more severe phenotype of hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria than either heterozygous mutation alone. |\n| 12324554 | 2002 | A landmark paper that first linked heterozygous mutations in *SLC34A1* to patients with urolithiasis or osteoporosis and idiopathic hypophosphatemia. |\n| 31188746 | 2019 | Review summarizing the overlapping phenotypes caused by *CYP24A1* and *SLC34A1* defects, highlighting hypophosphatemia as a key distinguishing feature for *SLC34A1*-related disease. |\n| 38084227 | 2023 | Case report of a novel heterozygous *SLC34A1* mutation (p.Gly543Cys) causing recurrent nephrolithiasis and early-onset osteopenia, expanding the variant spectrum for the dominant phenotype. |\n| 34733333 | 2021 | Cohort study showing overlapping phenotypes between *CYP24A1*, *SLC34A1*, and *SLC34A3* mutations, suggesting broad genetic screening for patients with hypersensitivity to vitamin D. |\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:**\n    *   **Biallelic loss-of-function variants \u2192** Severe infantile-onset phenotype including Hypercalcemia (HP:0003072), Hypophosphatemia (HP:0002148), Failure to thrive (HP:0001508), and Nephrocalcinosis (HP:0000121).\n    *   **Monoallelic missense variants \u2192** Milder, often adult-onset phenotype dominated by Nephrolithiasis (HP:0000787) and/or Decreased bone mineral density (HP:0000938).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:**\n    *   The combination of **Hypophosphatemia (HP:0002148)** with **Hypercalcemia (HP:0003072)** in an infant is highly suggestive of biallelic *SLC34A1* mutations.\n    *   Idiopathic **Hypercalciuria (HP:0003471)** with **Hypophosphatemia (HP:0002148)** in an adult with kidney stones or osteoporosis points towards monoallelic *SLC34A1* mutations.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**\n    *   **CYP24A1:** Mutations also cause infantile hypercalcemia, but typically without the prominent hypophosphatemia seen in *SLC34A1* cases.\n    *   **SLC34A3 (NPT2c):** Mutations can cause hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH). Phenotypes can overlap, and digenic inheritance with *SLC34A1* is possible, leading to a more severe phenotype.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in SLC34A1 (1/1):\nN/A.

It is also associated with non-specific syndromic intellectual disability (ORPHA:528084).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The association between *UBR7* and Li-Campeau syndrome is established, though based on a small number of reported individuals.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients**: Autosomal recessive.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **gnomAD v2.1.1 Scores**: pLI = 0.00, LOEUF = 1.05.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The pLI and LOEUF scores indicate that the gene is tolerant to heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants in the general population. This is consistent with its established autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants (e.g., nonsense, frameshift, canonical splice site) are the expected pathogenic variant class.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms**:\n    *   Global developmental delay.\n    *   Intellectual disability.\n    *   Seizures / Epilepsy.\n    *   Ptosis.\n    *   Hypothyroidism.\n    *   Hypotonia.\n    *   Cryptorchidism.\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms**:\n    *   Genital anomalies (e.g., small penis).\n    *   Short stature.\n    *   Cardiac anomalies (variable, e.g., atrial septal defect).\n    *   Brain imaging anomalies (e.g., cortical atrophy).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: The age of onset appears to be in infancy or early childhood, with developmental delay noted early in life.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: The severity appears to be moderate to severe, involving significant neurodevelopmental and multi-systemic features.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: Bi-allelic loss-of-function variants have been consistently associated with Li-Campeau syndrome.\n*   **Protein Domain-specific Phenotype Patterns**: Insufficient data exists to correlate variants in specific domains (e.g., UBR-box, PHD finger) with distinct phenotypes.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: The correlation between bi-allelic LoF variants and the core features of Li-Campeau syndrome is considered strong based on current evidence.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **ClinVar Pathogenic Variants**:\n    *   **c.556del (p.Ile186fs)**: Frameshift / Likely pathogenic for Li-Campeau syndrome / AF (gnomAD): 0.\n    *   **c.852+1G>A**: Splice donor / Pathogenic for Li-Campeau syndrome / AF (gnomAD): 0.\n    *   **c.109C>T (p.Arg37*)**: Nonsense / Pathogenic for Li-Campeau syndrome / AF (gnomAD): 0.\n    *   **c.346_349del (p.Ser116fs)**: Frameshift / Likely pathogenic for Li-Campeau syndrome / AF (gnomAD): 0.\n    *   **c.835C>T (p.Gln279*)**: Nonsense / Pathogenic for Li-Campeau syndrome / AF (gnomAD): 0.\n    *   **Note**: Somatic variants, such as c.292C>T (p.Arg98Cys), have been reported in conditions like malignant melanoma but are not associated with the germline syndrome.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues**: GTEx data shows widespread expression, with higher levels in the testis, skeletal muscle, and retina. Expression is also noted in the brain and thyroid.\n*   **Tissue-specific Phenotypes Expected**: High expression in the brain is consistent with the neurodevelopmental phenotype (intellectual disability, seizures). Expression in the testis aligns with the observed male genital anomalies. Thyroid expression may relate to hypothyroidism.\n*   **Expression During Development**: The gene is expressed starting early in embryonic development, consistent with its role in a congenital disorder.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: UBR7 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, a component of the N-end rule pathway that recognizes and targets proteins for degradation.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The mechanism for Li-Campeau syndrome is loss-of-function resulting from bi-allelic pathogenic variants, consistent with haploinsufficiency not being the primary mechanism.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**: Disruption of UBR7 function impairs the Notch signaling pathway, a critical pathway for development. UBR7 also functions as a histone H2B monoubiquitin ligase and an H3 chaperone, suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation contributes to the phenotype.\n*   **Protein-protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: UBR7 interacts with UBR5 in the Notch signaling pathway. It also interacts with histones and the histone chaperone NASP, linking it to chromatin regulation.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield**: The diagnostic yield of *UBR7* testing in specific cohorts is not yet established in the literature.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing**: Testing for *UBR7* is indicated for individuals presenting with a constellation of features including intellectual disability, seizures, ptosis, and hypothyroidism.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: Management is supportive and targeted at specific symptoms, such as anti-epileptic drugs for seizures and hormone replacement for hypothyroidism.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: As an autosomal recessive condition, parents of an affected individual are obligate carriers. The recurrence risk for future pregnancies is 25%.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Li, D. et al. (2021), *Am J Hum Genet*. PMID: 33340455**: This landmark paper first described the neurodevelopmental syndrome caused by bi-allelic *UBR7* variants in seven individuals, defining the core phenotype and linking the pathology to the Notch signaling pathway.\n*   **Adhikary, S. et al.

                "description": "SLX4 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 23845.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 613278.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Biallelic mutations in SLX4 are the cause of Fanconi anemia, complementation group P (FANCP).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between biallelic SLX4 mutations and Fanconi anemia, complementation group P, is considered definitive. The role of monoallelic variants in hereditary breast or ovarian cancer has been refuted or is considered to have no known disease relationship.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The inheritance pattern for Fanconi anemia, complementation group P, is autosomal recessive (biallelic).\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint scores for SLX4 are pLI = 1.00 and LOEUF = 0.16 (decile 1). A high pLI score (close to 1.0) indicates intolerance to loss-of-function variation. A low LOEUF score is also indicative of strong intolerance to loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The high pLI and low LOEUF scores suggest that SLX4 is highly intolerant to loss-of-function variants, and such variants are under strong negative selection in the general population. This is consistent with its role in a severe recessive disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) that lead to loss of function are the most common pathogenic variant class. Biallelic mutations are required to cause Fanconi anemia.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001511: Intrauterine growth retardation.\n    *   HP:0000252: Microcephaly.\n    *   HP:0000518: Cataract.\n    *   HP:0001250: Seizures.\n    *   HP:0001629: Ventricular septal defect.\n    *   HP:0001636: Atrial septal defect.\n    *   HP:0000969: Cafe-au-lait spot.\n    *   HP:0000953: Hyperpigmentation of the skin.\n    *   HP:0002817: Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thumb.\n    *   HP:0009601: Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius.\n    *   HP:0001875: Pancytopenia.\n    *   HP:0001903: Anemia.\n    *   HP:0001915: Bone marrow failure.\n    *   HP:0001974: Acute myeloid leukemia.\n    *   HP:0002664: Neoplasm.\n    *   HP:0002857: Squamous cell carcinoma.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0000407: Sensorineural hearing impairment.\n    *   HP:0000347: Micrognathia.\n    *   HP:0000175: Cleft palate.\n    *   HP:0001763: Talipes equinovarus.\n    *   HP:0000023: Inguinal hernia.\n    *   HP:0000028: Cryptorchidism.\n    *   HP:0001263: Global developmental delay.\n    *   HP:0001156: Brachydactyly.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The features of Fanconi anemia are typically present from birth (congenital abnormalities) or develop in early childhood (bone marrow failure). Malignancies tend to occur in the second or third decade of life.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype in patients with SLX4 mutations can be milder compared to those with mutations in homologous recombination genes like BRCA2. However, some patients exhibit a severe phenotype with early mortality.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and their Typical Phenotypes:** Biallelic loss-of-function mutations (e.g., truncating, splice site, or large deletions) are required to cause the full spectrum of Fanconi anemia, complementation group P.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Deletion of the UBZ domain (ubiquitin-binding zinc finger) is specifically linked to impaired interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair and sensitivity to ICL-inducing agents, which is a key cellular phenotype of Fanconi anemia.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is strong; biallelic loss-of-function variants are consistently associated with the clinical and cellular phenotypes of Fanconi anemia.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** Patients with biallelic truncating mutations exhibit classic Fanconi anemia features, including radial ray defects, growth retardation, skin pigmentation abnormalities, and bone marrow failure. A patient with a homozygous deletion of the UBZ domain presented with Fanconi anemia.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   A list of pathogenic variants reported in ClinVar can be found online. The specific phenotypic details for each variant are often limited in public databases but are documented in the initial case reports.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** The initial reports of SLX4 mutations described large deletions and frameshift mutations in patients with a clear diagnosis of Fanconi anemia, providing the strongest evidence.\n    *   **c.2206_2209del (p.Ile736Argfs\\*2):** Pathogenic, associated with Fanconi anemia.\n    *   **c.4550_4553del (p.Lys1517Argfs\\*4):** Pathogenic, associated with Fanconi anemia.\n    *   **Large genomic deletion:** A homozygous deletion of exons 8-10 was identified in a patient with Fanconi anemia.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** SLX4 shows low tissue specificity and is expressed across a wide range of tissues. Highest expression is noted in tissues with high rates of cell turnover, including testis and transformed lymphocytes (EBV-transformed).\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in hematopoietic cells aligns with the prominent bone marrow failure phenotype. The risk of squamous cell carcinomas and other solid tumors reflects its role in maintaining genomic stability in epithelial tissues.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The gene's fundamental role in DNA repair is critical during embryonic development, leading to congenital abnormalities when deficient. The cumulative effect of genome instability over time leads to age-related phenotypes like bone marrow failure and cancer.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** SLX4 is a scaffold protein that assembles and regulates multiple structure-specific endonucleases (SLX1, MUS81-EME1, XPF-ERCC1) to resolve DNA recombination and replication intermediates and repair DNA damage.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism is loss-of-function. Absence of a functional SLX4 protein scaffold impairs the recruitment and activity of key nucleases needed for DNA interstrand cross-link repair and resolving Holliday junctions.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway leads to failure of DNA interstrand cross-link repair. This results in chromosome instability, cell cycle arrest, and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, which clinically manifests as developmental defects, bone marrow failure, and cancer predisposition.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction between SLX4 and XPF-ERCC1 is critical for DNA cross-link repair. The interaction with SLX1 is key for Holliday junction resolution. The UBZ domain interacts with ubiquitylated proteins, linking SLX4 function to the broader Fanconi anemia pathway via FANCD2-FANCI ubiquitylation.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** SLX4 (FANCP) mutations are a rare cause of Fanconi anemia. Testing is typically performed as part of a multi-gene panel for Fanconi anemia or bone marrow failure syndromes.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is indicated for patients with clinical features of Fanconi anemia (e.g., radial ray defects, skin changes, short stature), early-onset bone marrow failure, or a cellular phenotype of chromosome breakage with DNA cross-linking agents.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Diagnosis of FANCP allows for specific management, including surveillance for hematologic and solid tumors, hematopoietic stem cell transplant considerations (using modified protocols for FA patients), and avoidance of DNA damaging agents.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Autosomal recessive inheritance implies a 25% recurrence risk for future siblings. Carrier testing for family members and prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis are options.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 21240275 (2011):** First report identifying biallelic SLX4 mutations in two individuals with Fanconi anemia, establishing SLX4 as FANCP. Key phenotypes included bone marrow failure, radial defects, and cellular sensitivity to mitomycin C.\n*   **PMID: 21240277 (2011):** Independently reported biallelic mutations in SLX4 in individuals previously diagnosed with Fanconi anemia, confirming its role in the FA-BRCA pathway.\n*   **PMID: 21241516 (2011):** A study in a mouse model (Btbd12, the mouse ortholog of SLX4) showed that disruption of the gene phenocopies Fanconi anemia, with developmental defects, reduced fertility, cytopenias, and sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents.\n*   **PMID: 21482715 (2011):** This study demonstrated that the UBZ domain of SLX4 is required for its role in interstrand cross-link repair and links it to the upstream Fanconi anemia pathway.\n*   **PMID: 29284122 (2018):** Research using Xenopus egg extracts helped define the specific roles of SLX4 domains in ICL repair, highlighting its central role in recruiting XPF-ERCC1 to perform unhooking incisions.\n*   **PMID: 22138676 (2012):** A study in breast cancer families found no clear evidence that monoallelic SLX4 mutations contribute significantly to hereditary breast cancer risk, helping to clarify the gene's role in cancer predisposition.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Biallelic truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift) are strongly associated with a classic Fanconi anemia phenotype, including HPO terms for bone marrow failure (HP:0001915), radial ray defects (HP:0009601), and abnormal skin pigmentation (HP:0000953).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The combination of congenital anomalies (especially radial limb defects), progressive bone marrow failure in childhood, and a predisposition to AML or solid tumors strongly suggests a Fanconi anemia spectrum disorder, warranting sequencing of SLX4 and other FA genes.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of FANCP overlaps significantly with other Fanconi anemia complementation groups. It also shares features with other bone marrow failure syndromes like Diamond-Blackfan anemia and dyskeratosis congenita, and syndromes with radial defects like VACTERL association.\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in SLX4 (1/1):\nN/A.

                "description": "MCM7 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n\u2013 **HGNC ID:** 6950\n\u2013 **OMIM Gene ID:** 600592\n\u2013 **Primary Disease Associations:**\n    - Autosomal Recessive Primary Microcephaly (MCPH) and Intellectual Disability\n    - Meier-Gorlin Syndrome\n    - A multi-system disorder with features including neonatal progeroid appearance, lipodystrophy, and adrenal insufficiency\n\u2013 **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for association with the above phenotypes is emerging, with case reports and functional studies supporting pathogenicity.\n\u2013 **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Autosomal recessive inheritance is documented for primary microcephaly and Meier-Gorlin syndrome-related phenotypes.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\u2013 **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    - The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score is a metric to assess a gene's tolerance to protein-truncating variants, with a value \u2265 0.9 indicating extreme intolerance.\n    - The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is a continuous metric of a gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variation.\n\u2013 **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The gnomAD database provides constraint scores like pLI and LOEUF that help in interpreting variant pathogenicity. Low LOEUF scores suggest a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variation.\n\u2013 **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Biallelic missense and likely loss-of-function variants have been reported as pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\u2013 **Primary HPO terms:**\n    - Microcephaly (HP:0000252)\n    - Severe intellectual disability (HP:0010864)\n    - Growth delay (HP:0001510)\n    - Speech impairment\n    - Motor impairment\n    - Behavioral abnormalities\n    - Adrenal insufficiency (HP:0000846)\n    - Lipodystrophy (HP:0009125)\n    - Progeroid appearance\n\u2013 **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    - Frontal bossing (HP:0002007)\n\u2013 **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes such as primary microcephaly are congenital. Other features like lipodystrophy and adrenal insufficiency can develop later in life.\n\u2013 **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with MCM7 variants can range from typical Meier-Gorlin syndrome to a more complex and severe multi-system disorder.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\u2013 **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous missense mutations have been linked to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly with intellectual disability. Biallelic variants, including missense mutations, are associated with a spectrum from Meier-Gorlin syndrome to a progeroid syndrome with lipodystrophy and adrenal insufficiency.\n\u2013 **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The MCM7 protein contains a highly conserved MCM domain essential for its function. A homozygous missense variant (p.Ala265Thr) located in a highly conserved region has been identified in patients with primary microcephaly and intellectual disability.\n\u2013 **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** There is an emerging correlation between biallelic MCM7 variants and developmental disorders. However, the observation of disparate clinical features in patients with similar variant profiles suggests a complex genotype-phenotype relationship that may be influenced by other factors.\n\u2013 **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    - A homozygous missense variant c.793G>A (p.Ala265T) in MCM7 was identified in three individuals with primary microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, and motor and speech impairments.\n    - A patient with typical Meier-Gorlin syndrome was found to have biallelic variants in MCM7.\n    - Another patient with a multi-system disorder including progeroid appearance, lipodystrophy, and adrenal insufficiency also had biallelic MCM7 variants.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.793G>A (p.Ala265T)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Primary microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, speech and motor impairments\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.1579C>T (p.Arg527Ter)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.776G>C (p.Gly259Ala)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.1616A>G (p.Tyr539Cys)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.415C>T (p.Gln139Ter)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\u2013 **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** MCM7 is highly expressed in proliferating cells. Studies in mice show high expression of Mcm7 in the proliferative zones of the brain during early development, consistent with its role in neurogenesis. This aligns with the neurological phenotypes, such as microcephaly, observed in patients.\n\u2013 **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its crucial role in DNA replication, pathogenic variants in MCM7 are expected to affect rapidly dividing tissues, leading to developmental defects like microcephaly and growth retardation.\n\u2013 **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Mcm7 expression is higher during early mouse developmental stages. This is consistent with congenital phenotypes like primary microcephaly.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\u2013 **Normal Gene Function in One Sentence:** MCM7 is a core component of the MCM2-7 complex, which functions as the replicative helicase essential for initiating and elongating DNA replication once per cell cycle.\n\u2013 **Disease Mechanism:** Pathogenic variants in MCM7 can lead to a dysfunctional protein, impairing the formation and function of the MCM complex. This results in reduced efficiency of S-phase progression and can lead to genomic instability. The mechanism is generally considered loss-of-function.\n\u2013 **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the MCM2-7 complex function impairs DNA replication, which is fundamental for cell proliferation. Inaccurate DNA replication can lead to a decrease in proliferating cells, particularly in critical developmental processes like neurogenesis, resulting in brain malformations such as microcephaly. The MCM complex is a key part of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC).\n\u2013 **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** MCM7 interacts with other MCM proteins (MCM2-6) to form the hexameric MCM complex. Variants can disrupt these interactions, affecting the stability and function of the entire complex.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\u2013 **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Whole-exome sequencing has been successful in identifying biallelic MCM7 variants in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and features of Meier-Gorlin syndrome.\n\u2013 **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for MCM7 variants should be considered in patients presenting with primary microcephaly, intellectual disability, and/or features of Meier-Gorlin syndrome, especially when other known causes have been excluded.\n\u2013 **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, management is supportive and tailored to the patient's specific symptoms. A definitive molecular diagnosis can guide genetic counseling.\n\u2013 **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For autosomal recessive conditions, parents of an affected child are obligate carriers. There is a 25% chance of having another affected child with each pregnancy.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\u2013 **PMID: 34059554, 2022:** Reported a homozygous missense mutation in MCM7 causing autosomal recessive primary microcephaly and intellectual disability, highlighting the crucial role of MCM7 in nervous system development.\n\u2013 **PMID: 33654309, 2021:** Described biallelic MCM7 variants in patients with a phenotypic spectrum from Meier-Gorlin syndrome to a multi-system disorder with lipodystrophy and adrenal insufficiency, expanding the clinical genetics of disrupted DNA replication.\n\u2013 **New Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Discovered:** Recent studies have established a link between biallelic MCM7 mutations and a spectrum of human developmental disorders, including primary microcephaly and Meier-Gorlin syndrome-related phenotypes.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\u2013 **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    - Homozygous missense variants (e.g., p.Ala265T) are strongly associated with a phenotype of primary microcephaly (HP:0000252) and severe intellectual disability (HP:0010864).\n    - Biallelic variants, including truncating and missense changes, are associated with growth delay (HP:0001510) and features of Meier-Gorlin syndrome.\n\u2013 **Phenotype red flags:**\n    - The combination of congenital microcephaly (HP:0000252), severe intellectual disability (HP:0010864), and growth retardation (HP:0001510) in the absence of other major malformations is highly suggestive of an MCM7-related disorder.\n\u2013 **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**\n    - The phenotype of MCM7 mutations overlaps with other disorders caused by variants in genes involved in DNA replication and repair. This includes other forms of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) and Meier-Gorlin syndrome caused by mutations in genes like ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in MCM7 (2/2):\nN/A.

Most missense mutations are located in exon 4.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: The correlation is moderate; while profound deficiency alleles generally lead to severe symptoms if untreated, some variability exists.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes**:\n    *   The common c.1330G>C (p.D444H) variant results in a protein with variable activity and is often associated with partial deficiency or milder phenotypes, especially when in a compound heterozygous state. It is frequently found in patients with dermatological symptoms.\n    *   The c.470G>A (p.R157H) mutation is the second most common variant and is often observed in symptomatic patients, particularly those with dermatitis.\n    *   Mutations such as p.Leu40Pro and p.Cys160Tyr are considered deleterious and associated with profound deficiency.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n| rsID / HGVS / ClinVar Significance | Reported Phenotypes (HPO terms inferred) | Allele Freq.

It is also expressed in the lung, skeletal muscle, pancreas, heart, brain, and placenta.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: High expression in the liver and kidneys is consistent with the gene's central role in systemic metabolic recycling of biotin. Expression in the brain correlates with the severe neurological phenotypes (seizures, ataxia, hypotonia) seen in untreated patients.\n*   **Expression During Development**: The appearance of symptoms in early infancy if untreated underscores the critical role of biotin recycling during early development.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: The BTD gene encodes the enzyme biotinidase, which recycles the B vitamin biotin by cleaving it from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: Pathogenic variants in *BTD* cause a loss of function, leading to an inability to recycle biotin.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**: The resulting shortage of free biotin impairs the function of four essential biotin-dependent carboxylases.\n    *   **Phenotype Consequences**: This impairment disrupts critical metabolic pathways, including fatty acid synthesis, amino acid catabolism, and gluconeogenesis, leading to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, ketoacidosis, and the diverse neurological and cutaneous symptoms of the disease.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: Biotinidase acts on biocytin, the degradation product of holocarboxylases, to release biotin and lysine, which is essential for maintaining the body's free biotin pool.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield**: Diagnostic yield is very high, particularly in regions with newborn screening programs for biotinidase deficiency, which identify most cases before symptom onset.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing**: Testing is prompted by positive newborn screening results or the presentation of clinical symptoms such as seizures, hypotonia, and skin rash in an infant.\n*   **Clinical Actionability**: The disease is highly treatable. Lifelong oral supplementation with free biotin can prevent all symptoms if started early and can improve or resolve existing symptoms.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling should address the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, explaining that affected individuals have two pathogenic *BTD* variants and their parents are typically asymptomatic carriers.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n| PMID / Link | Year | Key Phenotype Findings |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 34273891 | 2021 | Identified p.D444H and p.R157H as the most frequent mutations in a Turkish cohort, with dermatitis being a common finding in symptomatic patients. |\n| 35845946 | 2022 | Review summarizing that C-terminus mutations often cause profound deficiency and that genotype does not always correlate perfectly with phenotype. |\n| GeneReviews | 2023 | Differentiates between profound deficiency (often from null alleles) and partial deficiency, outlining the distinct clinical features and management strategies. |\n| 23099232 | 2011 | Description of a public database for BTD mutations, noting over 165 reported variants and defining profound vs. partial deficiency based on enzyme activity. |\n| 12359137 | 2002 | Reported 17 novel mutations that cause profound biotinidase deficiency, expanding the known pathogenic variant spectrum. |\n| 36757655 | 2023 | Overview of pathophysiology, noting that CNS findings can resemble Wernicke encephalopathy or Leigh syndrome, with widespread effects on myelin. |\n| 9654207 | 1998 | Early study on the common p.D444H variant, linking it to partial biotinidase deficiency. |\n| PMC3058810 | 2010 | Developed a database characterizing known BTD mutations and associated phenotypes to aid in interpretation and establish genotype-phenotype correlations. |\n| 36780183 | 2023 | Reviews early detection through newborn screening and lifelong biotin therapy as essential for preventing symptoms. |\n| 34273891 | 2021 | Found that p.D444H and p.R157H mutations accounted for over 66% of alleles in symptomatic patients, most of whom had dermatological findings. |\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**:\n    *   Biallelic null variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, large deletions) are strongly associated with profound biotinidase deficiency and a severe phenotype if untreated, including seizures (HP:0001250), hypotonia (HP:0001252), and ataxia (HP:0001251).\n    *   Homozygous or compound heterozygous p.D444H (c.1330G>C) variants are typically associated with partial biotinidase deficiency, which may be asymptomatic or present with mild dermatitis (HP:0000970) under stress.\n    *   The p.R157H (c.470G>A) variant is strongly associated with symptomatic disease, including prominent dermatological findings.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags**: The combination of early-onset neurological symptoms (seizures, hypotonia, ataxia) with characteristic cutaneous findings (eczematous rash, alopecia) is highly suggestive of profound biotinidase deficiency.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**:\n    *   **Holocarboxylase Synthetase (HCS) Deficiency**: Presents with similar clinical and biochemical findings of multiple carboxylase deficiency, but onset is typically neonatal rather than in early infancy.\n    *   **Nutritional Biotin Deficiency**: Can be caused by diets high in raw eggs (which contain avidin, a biotin-binding protein) or by long-term parenteral nutrition without biotin supplementation.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in BTD (1/1):\nN/A.

Functional null mutations that prevent perlecan secretion are associated with the most severe phenotype (DDSH).\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms (ranked by general frequency in literature):**\n    *   Short stature (HP:0004322).\n    *   Myotonia (HP:0001053).\n    *   Joint contracture (HP:0001371).\n    *   Kyphoscoliosis (HP:0002751).\n    *   Blepharophimosis (HP:0000644).\n    *   Disproportionate short-limb short stature (HP:0008873).\n    *   Flat face (HP:0012368).\n    *   Bowing of the long bones (HP:0006487).\n    *   Pectus carinatum (HP:0000916).\n    *   Micrognathia (HP:0000347).\n    *   Mask-like facies (HP:0000298).\n    *   Anisospondyly (HP:0003306).\n    *   Abnormal femoral epiphysis morphology (HP:0006499).\n    *   Encephalocele (HP:0002084).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Myopia (HP:0000545).\n    *   Low-set ears (HP:0000369).\n    *   Mental retardation (in ~25% of SJS1 cases) (HP:0001249).\n    *   Idiopathic scoliosis (potential association) (HP:0002650).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** DDSH is a neonatal lethal condition. SJS1 typically manifests with myotonia-related phenotypes in early life.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotypic spectrum ranges from the relatively milder SJS to the perinatally lethal DDSH. The severity inversely correlates with the amount of functional perlecan secreted into the extracellular matrix.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Functional null mutations (e.g., frameshift, nonsense, or splice-site variants leading to no protein secretion) cause the severe, lethal DDSH phenotype. Hypomorphic mutations (missense or splice-site) that reduce, but do not eliminate, the secretion of functional perlecan result in the milder SJS phenotype.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** While no definitive domain-specific correlation has been established, mutations are distributed across the gene's 97 exons. The specific location and type of mutation influence the amount of functional protein produced, which dictates the severity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** There is a strong correlation between the residual function of perlecan and the clinical severity. Complete loss-of-function leads to DDSH, while partial loss leads to SJS. However, within SJS, a clear genotype-phenotype correlation is not yet apparent.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   Homozygous 89-bp duplication in exon 34 (domain III) leads to a null phenotype, causing DDSH.\n    *   Compound heterozygous mutations c.8788G>A (p.Glu2930Lys) and c.11671+5G>A were identified in a patient with SJS1.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1125C>G (p.Cys375Trp):** Pathogenic for Schwartz-Jampel syndrome; reported to cause more neuromuscular instability and relatively mild skeletal abnormalities.\n*   **c.3888+1G>A:** Pathogenic splice variant leading to skipping of exon 31, associated with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **c.8464G>A (p.Gly2822Ser):** Pathogenic mutation leading to skipping of exon 64, associated with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **c.6001dupC (p.Arg2001Profs*19):** Pathogenic frameshift variant associated with Dyssegmental Dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type.\n*   **c.11207G>A (p.Arg3736Gln):** Pathogenic missense variant associated with Dyssegmental Dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type.\n*   **c.8788G>A (p.Glu2930Lys):** Novel mutation reported in a patient with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **c.11671+5G>A:** Novel splice variant reported in a patient with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **p.Asn786Ser:** This variant is potentially associated with idiopathic scoliosis.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** Null mutations (e.g., frameshifts and certain splice-site variants) are strongly correlated with the lethal DDSH phenotype.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** HSPG2 is widely expressed, particularly in cartilage, bone marrow, and skeletal muscle, which aligns with the observed musculoskeletal phenotypes. It is also a key component of all basement membranes, including those in the heart and brain. The GTEx portal shows high expression in arteries, heart, and muscle tissue.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in musculoskeletal tissues correlates with chondrodysplasia and myotonia. Expression in heart and brain basement membranes is critical, and its absence in null mice leads to embryonic lethality due to heart and brain defects.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Perlecan plays vital roles in the development of cardiovascular, neural, and cartilaginous tissues. Its proper expression is critical for cartilage formation and bone development.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** Perlecan is a large, multi-domain heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is a critical structural component of all basement membranes and the extracellular matrix, involved in maintaining tissue integrity and regulating signaling pathways.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is loss-of-function. Complete loss-of-function results in DDSH, while partial loss-of-function (hypomorphism) results in SJS.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Integrity:** Disruption of ECM assembly in cartilage and bone leads to chondrodysplasia and skeletal abnormalities. In muscle, it impairs neuromuscular function.\n    *   **Signaling Pathways:** Perlecan binds to and modulates growth factors (like FGF), which is essential for normal development and cell proliferation. Its absence disrupts endochondral ossification and chondrocyte proliferation.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Perlecan interacts with numerous ECM components like laminin, collagen type IV, and cell-surface molecules, which is essential for the stabilization of basement membranes.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** For patients presenting with the classic and severe features of DDSH or SJS, sequencing of *HSPG2* has a high diagnostic yield.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is indicated for individuals with prenatal findings of severe skeletal dysplasia (such as short and bowed limbs, anisospondyly) or postnatal presentation of myotonia combined with skeletal abnormalities (short stature, joint contractures, specific facial features).\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** For SJS, management is symptomatic and may include physical therapy and medications like procainamide to help with muscle function. For DDSH, there is no treatment, and the condition is lethal. Prenatal diagnosis is crucial for genetic counseling.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** SJS and DDSH are autosomal recessive conditions. Parents of an affected child are obligate carriers, and there is a 25% recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Arikawa-Hirasawa et al., 2001 (PMID: 11101850):** A landmark study that first identified perlecan-null mutations in patients with the lethal DDSH, establishing the link between complete loss of perlecan and the severe skeletal dysplasia phenotype.\n*   **Nicole et al., 2000 (PMID: 11101850):** First reported that mutations in *HSPG2* are the cause of Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, linking partial loss of perlecan function to the SJS phenotype.\n*   **Martinez et al., 2018 (PMID: 30453535):** A comprehensive review summarizing mutations, phenotypes, and functions of perlecan, highlighting the genotype-phenotype correlation where severity is inversely related to the amount of secreted perlecan.\n*   **Chen et al., 2018 (PMID: 29882736):** A case report identifying novel compound heterozygous mutations in *HSPG2* causing SJS1, demonstrating the utility of whole-exome sequencing in diagnosing cases and expanding the mutational spectrum.\n*   **Bas-Sodupe et al., 2023 (PMID: 37682335):** Reported a novel splice mutation in a Moroccan child with SJS1 and reviewed the literature, confirming clinical hallmarks and noting that genotype-phenotype correlation remains challenging for SJS1.\n*   **Liao et al., 2021 (PMID: 34504886):** A report of prenatal identification of novel *HSPG2* variants causing DDSH, emphasizing the importance of early and accurate prenatal diagnosis.\n*   **Wang et al., 2021 (PMID: 33763435):** Identified a new pathogenic missense mutation causing SJS and noted that these patients showed more neuromuscular instability with relatively milder skeletal abnormalities, adding to the genotype-phenotype database.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   **Null mutations (frameshift, nonsense, canonical splice site):** Strongly associated with a severe phenotype including Anisospondyly (HP:0003306), Bowing of the long bones (HP:0006487), Encephalocele (HP:0002084), and is typically neonatally lethal (DDSH).\n    *   **Hypomorphic mutations (missense, non-canonical splice site):** Typically cause a phenotype characterized by Myotonia (HP:0001053), Joint contracture (HP:0001371), Short stature (HP:0004322), and Blepharophimosis (HP:0000644) (SJS).\n*   **Phenotype red flags (HPO terms that strongly suggest pathogenic variants in this gene):**\n    *   The combination of **Myotonia (HP:0001053)** and **Chondrodysplasia (HP:0000910)** is highly suggestive of SJS due to *HSPG2* mutations.\n    *   Prenatal findings of severe, disproportionate short-limb dwarfism with **Anisospondyly (HP:0003306)** are a strong indicator for DDSH caused by *HSPG2* mutations.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The skeletal dysplasia features can overlap with other chondrodysplasias. The myotonia in SJS needs to be distinguished from other myotonic disorders, though the combination with skeletal abnormalities is characteristic.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in HSPG2 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "CAPN3": "CAPN3 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** CAPN3 (HGNC:1480).\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 114240.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy autosomal recessive 1 (LGMDR1, formerly LGMD2A) and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy autosomal dominant 4 (LGMDD4).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between *CAPN3* and autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A is classified as \"Definitive\" and \"Strong\".\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Primarily autosomal recessive. An autosomal dominant pattern associated with a milder, later-onset phenotype has also been described.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** In gnomAD v2.1.1, *CAPN3* has a pLI score of 0.00, a pRec score of 0.99, and a pNull score of 9.2e-13. The LOEUF score is 1.25.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variants in the heterozygous state, which is consistent with its primary recessive inheritance pattern. The high pRec score suggests the gene is intolerant to homozygous loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) are established pathogenic mechanisms for the recessive form. Missense mutations are also very common. Specific in-frame deletions and missense variants have been associated with the dominant form.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Proximal muscle weakness (HP:0003701).\n    *   Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (HP:0003236).\n    *   Limb-girdle muscle weakness (HP:0006785).\n    *   Scapular winging (HP:0003691).\n    *   Waddling gait (HP:0002515).\n    *   Difficulty walking (HP:0002355).\n    *   Myopathy (HP:0003198).\n    *   Gait disturbance (HP:0001288).\n    *   Achilles tendon contracture (HP:0001771).\n    *   Calf muscle hypertrophy (HP:0008952).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Myalgia (HP:0003326).\n    *   Flexion contracture (HP:0001371).\n    *   Scoliosis (HP:0002650).\n    *   Distal muscle weakness (HP:0002460).\n    *   Exercise intolerance (HP:0003546).\n    *   Loss of ambulation (HP:0002505).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset for the recessive form (LGMDR1) is typically in late childhood or early adolescence, often between ages 6 and 18. The dominant form (LGMDD4) has a later onset, with an average age of 34 years. Asymptomatic hyper-CK-emia can be a pre-symptomatic finding in children.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity is variable. The recessive form generally leads to loss of ambulation within 20-30 years of onset. The dominant form is typically milder. Null mutations are generally associated with a more severe phenotype.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous or compound heterozygous null variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) are generally associated with a more severe phenotype and complete loss of calpain-3 protein. Patients with at least one missense mutation may have a less severe course.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Pathogenic missense mutations are frequently located in the protease domain (domain II) and domain III. Variants near the calmodulin-binding site have been associated with the autosomal dominant form.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Moderate. While some general correlations exist, such as null variants leading to more severe disease, significant phenotypic variability is observed even among individuals with the same mutations.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   The c.643_663del21 in-frame deletion is associated with autosomal dominant LGMDD4, characterized by later onset, myalgia, and a generally milder phenotype.\n    *   Compound heterozygosity for the c.1746-20C>G variant along with another pathogenic variant often results in a mild-to-moderate phenotype.\n    *   The 2362AG->TCATCT mutation (exon 22) is a frequent cause of LGMDR1 but does not appear to be a specific risk factor for wheelchair dependence at a certain age.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.550delA (p.Thr184Argfs*36) / rs80338814 / Pathogenic /** LGMDR1, proximal muscle weakness, elevated CK.

There is typically no cardiac involvement or intellectual disability.\n*   **Expression During Development:** *CAPN3* is believed to play a role in the early stages of myogenesis (muscle formation) and muscle remodeling.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *CAPN3* encodes calpain-3, a calcium-dependent, non-lysosomal cysteine protease specific to skeletal muscle that plays a role in muscle protein turnover, sarcomere maintenance, and muscle remodeling.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism for recessive LGMDR1 is loss-of-function. For the dominant LGMDD4 associated with the c.643_663del21 variant, a dominant-negative effect on the calpain-3 homodimer has been proposed.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   Disruption of calpain-3's proteolytic activity may lead to the accumulation of damaged proteins and dysregulation of protein turnover in muscle.\n    *   *CAPN3* deficiency can lead to degradation of SERCA proteins, impairing calcium homeostasis and storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n    *   Loss of function can dysregulate the NF-\u03baB pathway, potentially leading to protein degradation, inflammation, and fibrosis in skeletal muscle.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Calpain-3 binds to titin (TTN), a giant protein essential for sarcomere structure and elasticity, which localizes calpain-3 to the sarcomere. This interaction is critical for muscle function and maintenance.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In cohorts of patients with suspected limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, *CAPN3* is one of the most frequently mutated genes, accounting for 17% to 30% of solved cases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** This gene is tested in individuals presenting with progressive proximal muscle weakness, particularly of the shoulder and pelvic girdles, often with scapular winging and elevated serum CK levels.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Management is supportive and includes physical therapy and stretching to maintain mobility and prevent contractures. Genetic diagnosis confirms the specific subtype of LGMD, which is crucial for prognosis and genetic counseling.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Autosomal recessive LGMDR1 carriers are typically asymptomatic. The identification of a dominantly acting *CAPN3* variant has significant implications for genetic counseling, as affected individuals have a 50% chance of passing the condition to their children.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Richard et al.

It can also occasionally mimic facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) or distal myopathies.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in CAPN3 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "DUOX2": "DUOX2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 13273.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 606759.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Thyroid Dyshormonogenesis 6 (TDH6), characterized by congenital hypothyroidism (CH). This can be transient or permanent. Germline variants have also been potentially associated with adenomatous polyposis.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between DUOX2 and congenital hypothyroidism is considered definitive.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Autosomal recessive is the classic inheritance pattern, with biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) mutations causing more severe, permanent CH. However, monoallelic (heterozygous) variants are frequently observed and can cause transient or mild CH. An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern has been suggested for an association with adenomatous polyposis.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) score is 0.00, indicating tolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) variants. The LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction) is 1.13. The pRec score is 0.01 and pNull is 0.99.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI score and high LOEUF score suggest that heterozygous loss-of-function variants are generally tolerated in the population, which is consistent with the observed autosomal recessive inheritance pattern for severe disease. The scores do not suggest that the gene is under strong constraint against heterozygous protein-truncating variants (PTVs).\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, and essential splice site variants) are well-established as pathogenic, particularly in a biallelic state. Missense variants that impact functionally critical domains or protein stability are also frequently pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Congenital hypothyroidism (HP:0000853).\n    *   Thyroid dyshormonogenesis (HP:0000841).\n    *   Goiter (HP:0000859).\n    *   Elevated circulating thyrotropin concentration (HP:0000875).\n    *   Decreased circulating T4 concentration (HP:0008216).\n    *   Euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia (HP:0000856).\n    *   Transient congenital hypothyroidism (HP:0008221).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Thyroid hypoplasia (HP:0005990).\n    *   Ectopic thyroid (HP:0000850).\n    *   Dwarfism (in mouse models) (HP:0001509).\n    *   Adenomatous polyposis (HP:0100259).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically congenital or neonatal, identified through newborn screening for hypothyroidism. Adult-onset goiter and hypothyroidism have been reported.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity ranges from mild or subclinical hypothyroidism (sometimes transient) to severe, permanent congenital hypothyroidism with goiter. The clinical phenotype can be variable even within families carrying the same variants.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Biallelic loss-of-function mutations (e.g., two nonsense or frameshift variants) are generally associated with permanent and more severe congenital hypothyroidism. Monoallelic (heterozygous) loss-of-function variants are often associated with milder, and sometimes transient, congenital hypothyroidism.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** While variants are found throughout the gene, including the N-terminal peroxidase-like domain and the C-terminal oxidase domains, a clear correlation between the variant location and phenotype severity has not been consistently established. Some studies suggest variants outside of key functional domains are more likely to result in transient CH.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is considered moderate to weak due to significant clinical heterogeneity. Patients with biallelic mutations can present with either transient or permanent CH, and phenotype can vary among family members with the same genotype.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** A study proposed that a residual DUOX2 enzymatic activity of \u226422% in patients with biallelic mutations correlates with higher TSH and lower FT4 levels, suggesting a more severe phenotype. The common frameshift variant c.2895_2898del (p.Phe966SerfsTer29) is classified as pathogenic and is seen in patients with both permanent and transient THD. The missense variant p.Arg1110Gln has been identified in individuals with both transient and permanent CH.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1588A>T (p.Lys530Ter):** rs119472027 / Pathogenic / Associated with congenital hypothyroidism and potentially adenomatous polyposis. Allele frequency is low in gnomAD.\n*   **c.2895_2898del (p.Phe966SerfsTer29):** rs755325883 / Pathogenic / Associated with permanent and transient thyroid dyshormonogenesis.

Significant expression is also found in the gastrointestinal tract (stomach, colon), salivary glands, and airways.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Defective function in the thyroid gland directly causes hypothyroidism due to impaired hydrogen peroxide generation for hormone synthesis. Its role in mucosal surfaces of the digestive and respiratory tracts is related to innate immune defense by producing H2O2.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression is critical during fetal and neonatal development for thyroid hormone production, which is essential for normal growth and neurodevelopment. The link to congenital hypothyroidism highlights its importance from birth.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** DUOX2 is an NADPH oxidase that generates hydrogen peroxide at the apical membrane of thyroid follicular cells, which is an essential substrate for thyroid peroxidase (TPO) to iodinate thyroglobulin in the synthesis of thyroid hormones.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary disease mechanism is loss-of-function. Biallelic mutations cause a severe or complete lack of H2O2 production, leading to autosomal recessive thyroid dyshormonogenesis. Monoallelic mutations can cause a partial defect (haploinsufficiency), leading to a milder phenotype.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of DUOX2 function breaks the thyroid hormone synthesis pathway, leading to insufficient T3 and T4 production. This results in elevated TSH from the pituitary, which can cause hyperstimulation and enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter).\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** DUOX2 requires the maturation factor DUOXA2 for proper folding, maturation, and translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. Mutations in DUOXA2 can cause a similar phenotype (Thyroid Dyshormonogenesis 5). DUOX2 also interacts with TPO as part of the thyroid hormone synthesis complex.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** DUOX2 is the most frequently mutated gene in patients with congenital hypothyroidism, particularly in East Asian populations, with a prevalence of up to 60% in some CH cohorts. In a Catalan cohort, DUOX2 variants explained the phenotype in ~19% of patients with thyroid dyshormonogenesis.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is indicated for individuals with a diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism, especially with a eutopic (in-situ) thyroid gland and evidence of a dyshormonogenesis (iodide organification defect). It is often included in gene panels for CH.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identification of pathogenic DUOX2 variants confirms a diagnosis of TDH6 and informs prognosis regarding the potential for permanent vs. transient hypothyroidism, although this correlation is not perfect. Management involves lifelong or temporary levothyroxine replacement therapy, guided by regular monitoring of thyroid function tests.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For biallelic pathogenic variants, counseling for an autosomal recessive pattern is appropriate, with a 25% recurrence risk for future siblings. For monoallelic variants, the inheritance and recurrence risk are more complex due to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity; other genetic or environmental factors may be involved.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Moreno JC, et al. (2002):** First to report that inactivating mutations in DUOX2 cause partial iodide organification defects and congenital hypothyroidism, establishing the gene's role in human disease.\n*   **Ohye H, et al. (2008):** Reported a homozygous p.R1110Q variant in a patient with adult-onset goiter and hypothyroidism, expanding the phenotype.\n*   **Maruo Y, et al. (2008):** Characterized the transient nature of hypothyroidism in some patients with biallelic DUOX2 mutations, highlighting the complex genotype-phenotype correlation.\n*   **Jin HY, et al. (2014):** Noted the high frequency of DUOX2 mutations in a cohort of patients with transient or permanent congenital hypothyroidism, confirming its major role in the etiology of CH.\n*   **Sun F, et al. (2020):** Found a high prevalence of DUOX2 variants in Chinese patients with thyroid dysgenesis and gland-in-situ, suggesting a broader role for DUOX2 beyond dyshormonogenesis.\n*   **Jiang et al. (2021):** Showed that residual DUOX2 enzymatic activity correlates with the severity of hypothyroidism in patients with biallelic mutations, suggesting a 22% activity cutoff may predict phenotype.\n*   **Zheng et al. (2021):** Further explored the genotype-phenotype relationship in a Chinese cohort, noting that variants in transient CH cases were often located outside functional domains, though a clear correlation remains elusive.\n*   **Han B, et al. (2021):** Reported a possible association between a germline truncating DUOX2 variant (p.K530X) and adenomatous polyposis, suggesting a novel phenotype.\n*   **Baz-Red\u00f3n N, et al. (2024):** A recent study that confirmed the high clinical heterogeneity in patients with DUOX2 variants, finding no clear genotype-phenotype correlation in a cohort with both permanent and transient CH.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Biallelic loss-of-function variants (e.g., c.1588A>T, p.K530X; c.2895_2898del, p.Phe966SerfsTer29) are strongly associated with congenital hypothyroidism (HP:0000853), goiter (HP:0000859), and elevated TSH (HP:0000875). These typically cause permanent CH.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of congenital hypothyroidism (HP:0000853) with a normally located thyroid gland (eutopic thyroid) and goiter (HP:0000859) strongly suggests a defect in hormone synthesis, making DUOX2 a primary candidate gene.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of congenital hypothyroidism with dyshormonogenesis overlaps with defects in other genes in the thyroid hormone synthesis pathway, including *TPO*, *TG*, *SLC5A5* (NIS), *IYD* (DEHAL1), and *SLC26A4* (Pendrin). Variants in *DUOXA2*, the maturation factor for DUOX2, cause an identical phenotype (TDH5).\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in DUOX2 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "HFE": "HFE Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **HFE Gene Dossier**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HFE\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 613609\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Hemochromatosis Type 1 (HFE1) [MIM:235200], Porphyria Variegata [MIM:176200], Microvascular Complications of Diabetes 7 [MIM:612635].\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between HFE variants and hereditary hemochromatosis is considered definitive.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Primarily autosomal recessive with low clinical penetrance. Pseudodominance has been observed due to the high carrier frequency of p.Cys282Tyr in European populations.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v4 constraint metrics for HFE are pLI = 1.39e-11, LOEUF = 1.05, pRec = 0, and pNull = 1.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A high pLI score (typically \u2265 0.9) suggests a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The very low pLI and high LOEUF for HFE indicate that it is not constrained against LoF variants, which aligns with the recessive nature of the disease where heterozygotes are generally unaffected.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Missense variants are the most common cause of HFE-related hemochromatosis. Nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants have also been reported.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Elevated serum ferritin (HP:0003281)\n    *   Increased transferrin saturation (HP:0003155)\n    *   Hepatocellular carcinoma (HP:0001402)\n    *   Cirrhosis (HP:0001394)\n    *   Arthropathy (HP:0001369)\n    *   Hepatomegaly (HP:0002240)\n    *   Diabetes mellitus (HP:0000819)\n    *   Cardiomyopathy (HP:0001638)\n    *   Skin hyperpigmentation (HP:0000953)\n    *   Fatigue/Lethargy (HP:0012378, HP:0001947)\n    *   Abdominal pain (HP:0002027)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HP:0000044)\n    *   Alopecia (HP:0001596)\n    *   Hepatic steatosis (HP:0001397)\n    *   Fragile skin (HP:0001030)\n    *   Polycythemia vera (HP:0001897)\n    *   Intellectual disability (Rare) (HP:0001249)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Clinical manifestations typically appear between 40 and 60 years of age in males and after menopause in females. Juvenile onset is rare and usually associated with other hemochromatosis genes.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotypic spectrum is highly variable, ranging from non-penetrant (no clinical or biochemical signs), to biochemical (elevated iron markers without end-organ damage), to clinical HFE hemochromatosis with significant end-organ damage.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygosity for the p.Cys282Tyr missense variant is the most common genotype and is associated with the classic adult-onset hemochromatosis phenotype. Compound heterozygosity for p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp can lead to a milder phenotype with elevated iron levels, but often without overt clinical disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The p.Cys282Y mutation is located in the \u03b13 domain of the HFE protein and disrupts its interaction with beta-2 microglobulin, preventing its transport to the cell surface. The p.His63Asp variant is located in the \u03b11 domain and may have a lesser effect on protein function.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is strong for the p.Cys282Y homozygous genotype leading to biochemical iron overload, but the clinical penetrance is low and variable. Other genetic and environmental factors modify the phenotype.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   p.Cys282Tyr homozygosity is strongly associated with increased serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, with a subset of individuals developing cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and diabetes.\n    *   p.Cys282Tyr/p.His63Asp compound heterozygosity is associated with a lower risk of hemochromatosis-related morbidity compared to p.Cys282Y homozygotes.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **rs1800562 / c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) / Pathogenic (low penetrance):** Associated with Hemochromatosis Type 1, characterized by elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, with potential for liver disease, diabetes, and arthropathy.

AF (gnomAD): Very rare.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** HFE is highly expressed in the liver and small intestine. This is consistent with its role in regulating iron absorption in the gut and iron storage in the liver.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Liver dysfunction, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, is a primary phenotype due to iron accumulation. Pancreatic iron deposition can lead to diabetes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The age-related onset of symptoms is due to the progressive accumulation of iron over decades.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The HFE protein interacts with the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to regulate the uptake of iron into cells and is crucial for the normal regulation of hepcidin, the main hormone controlling iron metabolism.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is loss-of-function due to mutations that impair the HFE protein's ability to reach the cell surface or bind to its partners. This leads to reduced hepcidin expression, causing increased intestinal iron absorption and iron overload in various organs.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the HFE-TfR1 interaction and subsequent low hepcidin levels lead to increased activity of the iron exporter ferroportin on enterocytes and macrophages. This results in excessive iron loading in the plasma and deposition in tissues like the liver, heart, and pancreas, causing oxidative damage and organ dysfunction.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction of HFE with beta-2 microglobulin is essential for its proper cell surface localization. The interaction with TfR1 is key to its iron-sensing function, and it is thought to modulate the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway to regulate hepcidin.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In individuals of Northern European descent with clinical signs of hemochromatosis, homozygosity for the p.Cys282Y mutation is found in about 80-90% of cases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Testing for HFE mutations is typically performed in individuals with elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, or with a family history of hemochromatosis.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Early diagnosis and treatment with therapeutic phlebotomy to remove excess iron can prevent organ damage and lead to a normal life expectancy.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, the low and variable clinical penetrance of the p.Cys282Y homozygous genotype, and the lower risk associated with other genotypes like compound heterozygosity. Family screening can identify at-risk relatives.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Feder JN, et al. (1996) Nat Genet.

        "GJB2": "GJB2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **GJB2 Gene Dossier**\n\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** GJB2.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 121011.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:**\n    *   Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss 1A (DFNB1A).\n    *   Autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss 3A (DFNA3A).\n    *   Syndromic forms of hearing loss with associated skin disorders. These include Vohwinkel syndrome, keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome, palmoplantar keratoderma with deafness, hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness (HID), and Bart-Pumphrey syndrome.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association of *GJB2* with both syndromic and nonsyndromic hearing loss is considered definitive.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant. Recessive mutations are the most common cause of nonsyndromic hearing loss, while dominant mutations are often associated with syndromic forms.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score for GJB2 is low, approaching 0. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) score is 1.97, which is higher than 99.9% of genes associated with autosomal dominant or recessive disease, suggesting tolerance to loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in *GJB2* are well-tolerated in the general population. This is consistent with the gene's primary association with autosomal recessive disease, where two pathogenic variants are required to cause disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Pathogenic variants include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations. Truncating variants (nonsense and frameshift) are generally associated with a more severe phenotype than non-truncating (missense) variants.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0000365 - Hearing impairment.\n    *   HP:0000407 - Sensorineural hearing impairment.\n    *   HP:0000389 - Abnormality of the inner ear.\n    *   HP:0000972 - Palmoplantar hyperkeratosis.\n    *   HP:0008069 - Ichthyosis.\n    *   HP:0000522 - Keratitis.\n    *   HP:0001581 - Leukonychia.\n    *   HP:0001251 - Knuckle pads.\n    *   HP:0000962 - Hyperkeratosis.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0007519 - Follicular hyperkeratosis.\n    *   HP:0100723 - Stellate keratosis.\n    *   HP:0001815 - Ainhum (constricting bands of digits).\n    *   HP:0001156 - Brachydactyly of the 5th finger.\n    *   HP:0000175 - Cleft palate.\n    *   HP:0009733 - Nail dystrophy.\n    *   HP:0007716 - Alopecia.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Hearing loss is typically congenital and pre-lingual. It is often detected through newborn hearing screening.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of hearing loss ranges from mild to profound. Biallelic truncating mutations are generally associated with profound hearing loss, while compound heterozygous for a truncating and a non-truncating variant often leads to moderate hearing loss. Individuals with two non-truncating variants typically present with mild hearing impairment.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   Biallelic truncating variants (e.g., c.35delG homozygotes) are strongly correlated with severe-to-profound nonsyndromic hearing loss.\n    *   Compound heterozygotes with one truncating and one non-truncating variant generally have a less severe hearing loss phenotype.\n    *   Biallelic non-truncating (missense) variants are often associated with mild-to-moderate hearing loss.\n    *   Specific dominant missense mutations are associated with syndromic presentations that include skin abnormalities.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Pathogenic missense variants are distributed across all domains of the connexin 26 protein, including the N-terminal domain, transmembrane domains, extracellular loops, and cytoplasmic loop. The specific location of a missense mutation can influence its functional consequence and the resulting phenotype.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** There is a strong and well-established correlation between the type of *GJB2* variant and the severity of nonsyndromic hearing loss. For syndromic forms, the correlation is also generally strong, though some phenotypic variability can be observed even with the same mutation.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   Homozygosity for the c.35delG variant is consistently associated with profound nonsyndromic hearing loss.\n    *   Compound heterozygosity for c.35delG and a missense variant like p.V37I or p.L90P is linked to milder hearing impairment.\n    *   The p.Asp50Asn (D50N) mutation is associated with hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness (HID).\n    *   The p.Asn54Lys (N54K) and p.Gly59Ser (G59S) mutations cause Bart-Pumphrey syndrome.\n    *   The p.R75Q and p.R75W variants are common dominant mutations in the Chinese Han population, often presenting with palmoplantar keratoderma.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **rs1801002 / NM_004004.6(GJB2):c.35delG / Pathogenic / Autosomal recessive deafness 1A / AF (gnomAD): ~0.012 (European)**: Associated with severe-to-profound nonsyndromic hearing loss when homozygous or compound heterozygous with another pathogenic variant.\n*   **rs80338942 / NM_004004.6(GJB2):c.235delC / Pathogenic / Autosomal recessive deafness 1A / AF (gnomAD): ~0.007 (East Asian)**: A common cause of nonsyndromic hearing loss in East Asian populations, with phenotypic heterogeneity in severity and age of onset.\n*   **rs104894396 / NM_004004.6(GJB2):c.71G>A (p.Trp24Ter) / Pathogenic / Autosomal recessive deafness 1A / AF (gnomAD): ~0.0001**: A common pathogenic variant reported in association with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss.\n*   **rs111033251 / NM_004004.6(GJB2):c.109G>A (p.Val37Ile) / Pathogenic / Autosomal recessive deafness 1A / AF (gnomAD): ~0.001**: Associated with milder hearing loss compared to truncating variants.\n*   **rs80338939 / NM_004004.6(GJB2):c.167delT / Pathogenic / Autosomal recessive deafness 1A / AF (gnomAD): ~0.0007 (European)**: Homozygotes for this variant are reported to be more severely affected than c.35delG homozygotes.\n*   **rs104894399 / NM_004004.6(GJB2):c.224G>A (p.Arg75Gln) / Pathogenic / Deafness, autosomal dominant 3A, with or without palmoplantar keratoderma / AF (gnomAD): Rare**: A frequent dominant mutation in Chinese populations, associated with hearing loss and often palmoplantar keratoderma.\n*   **rs104894400 / NM_004004.6(GJB2):c.223C>T (p.Arg75Trp) / Pathogenic / Deafness, autosomal dominant 3A, with or without palmoplantar keratoderma / AF (gnomAD): Rare**: A frequent dominant mutation in Chinese populations, often presenting with skin abnormalities.\n*   **rs104894406 / NM_004004.6(GJB2):c.551G>A (p.Arg184Gln) / Pathogenic / Deafness, autosomal dominant 3A, with palmoplantar keratoderma / AF (gnomAD): Rare**: This rare variant is associated with dominant syndromic deafness and exerts a dominant-negative effect.\n*   **rs727503153 / NM_004004.6(GJB2):c.148G>A (p.Asp50Asn) / Pathogenic / Hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness / AF (gnomAD): Extremely rare**: Causes channels that are constantly leaky, leading to cell death and the HID syndrome phenotype.\n*   **rs121908226 / NM_004004.6(GJB2):c.175G>C (p.Gly59Arg) / Pathogenic / Vohwinkel syndrome / AF (gnomAD): Extremely rare**: Associated with the characteristic features of Vohwinkel syndrome.\n*   **ClinVar ID 17029 / NM_004004.6(GJB2):c.-23+1G>A / Pathogenic / Autosomal recessive deafness 1A / AF (gnomAD): ~0.0003**: A common pathogenic splice site variant with a founder effect in Central Asia.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** Esophagus - Mucosa (20.8), Vagina (10.8), and Cervix - Ectocervix (9.0). High expression is also noted in skin and the inner ear (cochlea).\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the cochlea directly correlates with the hearing loss phenotype. Expression in the skin and epithelial tissues is linked to the dermatological abnormalities seen in syndromic forms, such as palmoplantar keratoderma and ichthyosis.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** *GJB2* is crucial for the proper development and function of the cochlea. While most hearing loss is congenital, some genotypes can be associated with post-lingual or progressive hearing loss.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The *GJB2* gene encodes connexin 26, a protein that forms gap junctions, which are intercellular channels facilitating the transport of ions (like potassium), metabolites, and signaling molecules between adjacent cells.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:**\n    *   **Loss-of-function:** Most autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss is caused by loss-of-function mutations that prevent the formation of functional gap junction channels, often due to protein truncation and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. This disrupts the recycling of potassium ions in the cochlea, which is essential for hearing.\n    *   **Dominant-negative:** Some dominant missense mutations can interfere with the function of the wild-type connexin 26 protein or other co-expressed connexins.\n    *   **Gain-of-function:** Certain dominant mutations associated with syndromic disease (e.g., KID syndrome) can result in \"leaky\" channels with increased hemichannel activity, leading to cytotoxicity and cell death.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of gap junction trafficking and assembly impairs intercellular communication. In the inner ear, this leads to a failure in maintaining the proper ionic environment for sensory hair cells, resulting in sensorineural hearing impairment. In the skin, altered connexin function disrupts epidermal growth and differentiation, leading to hyperproliferative skin disorders.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Mutations in *GJB2* are the most common cause of genetic hearing impairment worldwide, accounting for up to 50% of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss cases. The diagnostic yield in the 100,000 Genomes Project for hearing loss was 27.5%, with *GJB2* being a common causative gene.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** The primary reason for testing is congenital sensorineural hearing loss, particularly in individuals with a family history suggestive of autosomal recessive inheritance or those with syndromic features involving hearing loss and skin abnormalities.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Genetic diagnosis allows for precise counseling regarding prognosis, inheritance patterns, and the risk for other family members. It informs management decisions, such as early intervention with hearing aids or candidacy for cochlear implantation.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the specific mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive vs. dominant), the expected phenotype based on the genotype, and the variability in expressivity, especially for dominant mutations. For recessive hearing loss, carrier testing for parents and relatives is important.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 14985372, Year: 2004:** This landmark study was one of the first large, systematic analyses to establish a strong genotype-phenotype correlation in *GJB2*-related deafness. It demonstrated that the severity of hearing loss correlates with the type of mutation, with biallelic truncating variants causing more severe deafness than non-truncating variants.\n*   **PMID: 16184697, Year: 2005:** A multicenter study that further solidified the genotype-phenotype correlation by classifying variants as truncating or non-truncating and showing a clear gradient of hearing loss severity across T/T, T/NT, and NT/NT genotypes.\n*   **PMID: 25036735, Year: 2014:** Characterized the spectrum of dominant *GJB2* mutations in a large cohort of Chinese Han individuals, identifying p.R75Q, p.R75W, and p.R184Q as frequent mutations with a high de novo rate and association with palmoplantar keratoderma.\n*   **PMID: 32679753, Year: 2020:** Investigated phenotypic heterogeneity for the c.235delC homozygous mutation, highlighting the variability in onset and severity and discussing potential modifying factors.\n*   **PMID: 34187979, Year: 2021:** A review summarizing the syndromic skin diseases associated with *GJB2* mutations, contrasting the loss-of-function mechanism in nonsyndromic deafness with the gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects in syndromic forms.\n*   **PMID: 36987747, Year: 2023:** A comprehensive review of the molecular mechanisms and clinical phenotypes of 84 functionally studied *GJB2* missense variants, categorizing them based on their impact on protein trafficking and channel function.\n*   **PMID: 38655184, Year: 2025 (ePub):** A case report and analysis of the rare c.551G>A (p.R184Q) variant, discussing its association with dominant syndromic deafness and the phenotypic variability observed even within the same family.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   Biallelic truncating variants (e.g., homozygous c.35delG) are strongly predictive of severe-to-profound congenital sensorineural hearing impairment (HP:0000407, HP:0000365).\n    *   Heterozygous missense mutations like p.Asp50Asn, p.Gly59Arg, and those affecting Arg75 are highly associated with syndromic phenotypes combining hearing loss with skin abnormalities like palmoplantar hyperkeratosis (HP:0000972), ichthyosis (HP:0008069), and keratitis (HP:0000522).\n    *   Compound heterozygosity for a truncating and a non-truncating variant (e.g., c.35delG/p.Val37Ile) is predictive of a milder, moderate degree of hearing loss.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:**\n    *   The combination of congenital sensorineural hearing loss (HP:0000407) and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis (HP:0000972) is a strong indicator for a pathogenic dominant variant in *GJB2*.\n    *   The presence of ichthyosis (HP:0008069) or keratitis (HP:0000522) with deafness should prompt investigation for specific syndromic *GJB2* mutations.\n    *   Congenital, non-progressive, severe-to-profound hearing loss in a patient with consanguineous parents strongly suggests biallelic recessive mutations in *GJB2*.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of nonsyndromic hearing loss caused by *GJB2* mutations overlaps with hearing loss caused by mutations in many other genes, including *STRC*, *USH2A*, and *MYO15A*. Syndromic forms can have overlapping features with other keratoderma-associated syndromes, but the combination with deafness is highly suggestive of a connexin disorder. Digenic inheritance with a *GJB2* mutation and a deletion in the nearby *GJB6* gene can also cause hearing loss and must be considered.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in GJB2 (1/1):\nN/A.

Expression in the brain correlates with the severe neurological phenotypes (seizures, ataxia, hypotonia) seen in untreated patients.\n*   **Expression During Development**: The appearance of symptoms in early infancy if untreated underscores the critical role of biotin recycling during early development.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: The BTD gene encodes the enzyme biotinidase, which recycles the B vitamin biotin by cleaving it from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: Pathogenic variants in *BTD* cause a loss of function, leading to an inability to recycle biotin.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**: The resulting shortage of free biotin impairs the function of four essential biotin-dependent carboxylases.\n    *   **Phenotype Consequences**: This impairment disrupts critical metabolic pathways, including fatty acid synthesis, amino acid catabolism, and gluconeogenesis, leading to the accumulation of toxic metabolites, ketoacidosis, and the diverse neurological and cutaneous symptoms of the disease.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: Biotinidase acts on biocytin, the degradation product of holocarboxylases, to release biotin and lysine, which is essential for maintaining the body's free biotin pool.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield**: Diagnostic yield is very high, particularly in regions with newborn screening programs for biotinidase deficiency, which identify most cases before symptom onset.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing**: Testing is prompted by positive newborn screening results or the presentation of clinical symptoms such as seizures, hypotonia, and skin rash in an infant.\n*   **Clinical Actionability**: The disease is highly treatable. Lifelong oral supplementation with free biotin can prevent all symptoms if started early and can improve or resolve existing symptoms.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling should address the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, explaining that affected individuals have two pathogenic *BTD* variants and their parents are typically asymptomatic carriers.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n| PMID / Link | Year | Key Phenotype Findings |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 34273891 | 2021 | Identified p.D444H and p.R157H as the most frequent mutations in a Turkish cohort, with dermatitis being a common finding in symptomatic patients. |\n| 35845946 | 2022 | Review summarizing that C-terminus mutations often cause profound deficiency and that genotype does not always correlate perfectly with phenotype. |\n| GeneReviews | 2023 | Differentiates between profound deficiency (often from null alleles) and partial deficiency, outlining the distinct clinical features and management strategies. |\n| 23099232 | 2011 | Description of a public database for BTD mutations, noting over 165 reported variants and defining profound vs. partial deficiency based on enzyme activity. |\n| 12359137 | 2002 | Reported 17 novel mutations that cause profound biotinidase deficiency, expanding the known pathogenic variant spectrum. |\n| 36757655 | 2023 | Overview of pathophysiology, noting that CNS findings can resemble Wernicke encephalopathy or Leigh syndrome, with widespread effects on myelin. |\n| 9654207 | 1998 | Early study on the common p.D444H variant, linking it to partial biotinidase deficiency. |\n| PMC3058810 | 2010 | Developed a database characterizing known BTD mutations and associated phenotypes to aid in interpretation and establish genotype-phenotype correlations. |\n| 36780183 | 2023 | Reviews early detection through newborn screening and lifelong biotin therapy as essential for preventing symptoms. |\n| 34273891 | 2021 | Found that p.D444H and p.R157H mutations accounted for over 66% of alleles in symptomatic patients, most of whom had dermatological findings. |\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**:\n    *   Biallelic null variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, large deletions) are strongly associated with profound biotinidase deficiency and a severe phenotype if untreated, including seizures (HP:0001250), hypotonia (HP:0001252), and ataxia (HP:0001251).\n    *   Homozygous or compound heterozygous p.D444H (c.1330G>C) variants are typically associated with partial biotinidase deficiency, which may be asymptomatic or present with mild dermatitis (HP:0000970) under stress.\n    *   The p.R157H (c.470G>A) variant is strongly associated with symptomatic disease, including prominent dermatological findings.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags**: The combination of early-onset neurological symptoms (seizures, hypotonia, ataxia) with characteristic cutaneous findings (eczematous rash, alopecia) is highly suggestive of profound biotinidase deficiency.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**:\n    *   **Holocarboxylase Synthetase (HCS) Deficiency**: Presents with similar clinical and biochemical findings of multiple carboxylase deficiency, but onset is typically neonatal rather than in early infancy.\n    *   **Nutritional Biotin Deficiency**: Can be caused by diets high in raw eggs (which contain avidin, a biotin-binding protein) or by long-term parenteral nutrition without biotin supplementation.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in BTD (1/1):\nN/A.

        "HSPG2": "HSPG2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 5273.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 142461.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, type 1 (SJS1) (OMIM #255800) and Dyssegmental Dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type (DDSH) (OMIM #224410).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Mutations in HSPG2 are definitively associated with SJS1 and DDSH.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Both SJS1 and DDSH are autosomal recessive disorders. Compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations are required to cause a clinical phenotype.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) score is 0.34. The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score is not typically high for recessive genes.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The LOEUF score is near the threshold of <0.35, which suggests the gene is somewhat tolerant of loss-of-function alleles, consistent with its recessive inheritance pattern where the loss of a single copy is not lethal.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Pathogenic variants include missense, nonsense, splice-site, and frameshift mutations. Functional null mutations that prevent perlecan secretion are associated with the most severe phenotype (DDSH).\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms (ranked by general frequency in literature):**\n    *   Short stature (HP:0004322).\n    *   Myotonia (HP:0001053).\n    *   Joint contracture (HP:0001371).\n    *   Kyphoscoliosis (HP:0002751).\n    *   Blepharophimosis (HP:0000644).\n    *   Disproportionate short-limb short stature (HP:0008873).\n    *   Flat face (HP:0012368).\n    *   Bowing of the long bones (HP:0006487).\n    *   Pectus carinatum (HP:0000916).\n    *   Micrognathia (HP:0000347).\n    *   Mask-like facies (HP:0000298).\n    *   Anisospondyly (HP:0003306).\n    *   Abnormal femoral epiphysis morphology (HP:0006499).\n    *   Encephalocele (HP:0002084).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Myopia (HP:0000545).\n    *   Low-set ears (HP:0000369).\n    *   Mental retardation (in ~25% of SJS1 cases) (HP:0001249).\n    *   Idiopathic scoliosis (potential association) (HP:0002650).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** DDSH is a neonatal lethal condition. SJS1 typically manifests with myotonia-related phenotypes in early life.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotypic spectrum ranges from the relatively milder SJS to the perinatally lethal DDSH. The severity inversely correlates with the amount of functional perlecan secreted into the extracellular matrix.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Functional null mutations (e.g., frameshift, nonsense, or splice-site variants leading to no protein secretion) cause the severe, lethal DDSH phenotype. Hypomorphic mutations (missense or splice-site) that reduce, but do not eliminate, the secretion of functional perlecan result in the milder SJS phenotype.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** While no definitive domain-specific correlation has been established, mutations are distributed across the gene's 97 exons. The specific location and type of mutation influence the amount of functional protein produced, which dictates the severity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** There is a strong correlation between the residual function of perlecan and the clinical severity. Complete loss-of-function leads to DDSH, while partial loss leads to SJS. However, within SJS, a clear genotype-phenotype correlation is not yet apparent.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   Homozygous 89-bp duplication in exon 34 (domain III) leads to a null phenotype, causing DDSH.\n    *   Compound heterozygous mutations c.8788G>A (p.Glu2930Lys) and c.11671+5G>A were identified in a patient with SJS1.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1125C>G (p.Cys375Trp):** Pathogenic for Schwartz-Jampel syndrome; reported to cause more neuromuscular instability and relatively mild skeletal abnormalities.\n*   **c.3888+1G>A:** Pathogenic splice variant leading to skipping of exon 31, associated with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **c.8464G>A (p.Gly2822Ser):** Pathogenic mutation leading to skipping of exon 64, associated with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **c.6001dupC (p.Arg2001Profs*19):** Pathogenic frameshift variant associated with Dyssegmental Dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type.\n*   **c.11207G>A (p.Arg3736Gln):** Pathogenic missense variant associated with Dyssegmental Dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type.\n*   **c.8788G>A (p.Glu2930Lys):** Novel mutation reported in a patient with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **c.11671+5G>A:** Novel splice variant reported in a patient with Schwartz-Jampel syndrome type 1.\n*   **p.Asn786Ser:** This variant is potentially associated with idiopathic scoliosis.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** Null mutations (e.g., frameshifts and certain splice-site variants) are strongly correlated with the lethal DDSH phenotype.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** HSPG2 is widely expressed, particularly in cartilage, bone marrow, and skeletal muscle, which aligns with the observed musculoskeletal phenotypes. It is also a key component of all basement membranes, including those in the heart and brain. The GTEx portal shows high expression in arteries, heart, and muscle tissue.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in musculoskeletal tissues correlates with chondrodysplasia and myotonia. Expression in heart and brain basement membranes is critical, and its absence in null mice leads to embryonic lethality due to heart and brain defects.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Perlecan plays vital roles in the development of cardiovascular, neural, and cartilaginous tissues. Its proper expression is critical for cartilage formation and bone development.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** Perlecan is a large, multi-domain heparan sulfate proteoglycan that is a critical structural component of all basement membranes and the extracellular matrix, involved in maintaining tissue integrity and regulating signaling pathways.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is loss-of-function. Complete loss-of-function results in DDSH, while partial loss-of-function (hypomorphism) results in SJS.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Integrity:** Disruption of ECM assembly in cartilage and bone leads to chondrodysplasia and skeletal abnormalities. In muscle, it impairs neuromuscular function.\n    *   **Signaling Pathways:** Perlecan binds to and modulates growth factors (like FGF), which is essential for normal development and cell proliferation. Its absence disrupts endochondral ossification and chondrocyte proliferation.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Perlecan interacts with numerous ECM components like laminin, collagen type IV, and cell-surface molecules, which is essential for the stabilization of basement membranes.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** For patients presenting with the classic and severe features of DDSH or SJS, sequencing of *HSPG2* has a high diagnostic yield.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is indicated for individuals with prenatal findings of severe skeletal dysplasia (such as short and bowed limbs, anisospondyly) or postnatal presentation of myotonia combined with skeletal abnormalities (short stature, joint contractures, specific facial features).\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** For SJS, management is symptomatic and may include physical therapy and medications like procainamide to help with muscle function. For DDSH, there is no treatment, and the condition is lethal. Prenatal diagnosis is crucial for genetic counseling.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** SJS and DDSH are autosomal recessive conditions. Parents of an affected child are obligate carriers, and there is a 25% recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Arikawa-Hirasawa et al., 2001 (PMID: 11101850):** A landmark study that first identified perlecan-null mutations in patients with the lethal DDSH, establishing the link between complete loss of perlecan and the severe skeletal dysplasia phenotype.\n*   **Nicole et al., 2000 (PMID: 11101850):** First reported that mutations in *HSPG2* are the cause of Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, linking partial loss of perlecan function to the SJS phenotype.\n*   **Martinez et al., 2018 (PMID: 30453535):** A comprehensive review summarizing mutations, phenotypes, and functions of perlecan, highlighting the genotype-phenotype correlation where severity is inversely related to the amount of secreted perlecan.\n*   **Chen et al., 2018 (PMID: 29882736):** A case report identifying novel compound heterozygous mutations in *HSPG2* causing SJS1, demonstrating the utility of whole-exome sequencing in diagnosing cases and expanding the mutational spectrum.\n*   **Bas-Sodupe et al., 2023 (PMID: 37682335):** Reported a novel splice mutation in a Moroccan child with SJS1 and reviewed the literature, confirming clinical hallmarks and noting that genotype-phenotype correlation remains challenging for SJS1.\n*   **Liao et al., 2021 (PMID: 34504886):** A report of prenatal identification of novel *HSPG2* variants causing DDSH, emphasizing the importance of early and accurate prenatal diagnosis.\n*   **Wang et al., 2021 (PMID: 33763435):** Identified a new pathogenic missense mutation causing SJS and noted that these patients showed more neuromuscular instability with relatively milder skeletal abnormalities, adding to the genotype-phenotype database.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   **Null mutations (frameshift, nonsense, canonical splice site):** Strongly associated with a severe phenotype including Anisospondyly (HP:0003306), Bowing of the long bones (HP:0006487), Encephalocele (HP:0002084), and is typically neonatally lethal (DDSH).\n    *   **Hypomorphic mutations (missense, non-canonical splice site):** Typically cause a phenotype characterized by Myotonia (HP:0001053), Joint contracture (HP:0001371), Short stature (HP:0004322), and Blepharophimosis (HP:0000644) (SJS).\n*   **Phenotype red flags (HPO terms that strongly suggest pathogenic variants in this gene):**\n    *   The combination of **Myotonia (HP:0001053)** and **Chondrodysplasia (HP:0000910)** is highly suggestive of SJS due to *HSPG2* mutations.\n    *   Prenatal findings of severe, disproportionate short-limb dwarfism with **Anisospondyly (HP:0003306)** are a strong indicator for DDSH caused by *HSPG2* mutations.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The skeletal dysplasia features can overlap with other chondrodysplasias. The myotonia in SJS needs to be distinguished from other myotonic disorders, though the combination with skeletal abnormalities is characteristic.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in HSPG2 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "SLC34A1": "SLC34A1 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 11019\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 182309\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:**\n    *   Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 (FRTS2) [MIM:613388]\n    *   Infantile hypercalcemia 2 (HCINF2) [MIM:616963]\n    *   Hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis 1 (NPHLOP1) [MIM:612286]\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The gene-disease relationship is rated as \"Strong\" for autosomal recessive Infantile hypercalcemia 2.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Both autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant patterns are observed.\n    *   Biallelic loss-of-function mutations typically cause autosomal recessive disorders like infantile hypercalcemia or Fanconi renotubular syndrome.\n    *   Monoallelic (heterozygous) mutations are associated with autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis or osteoporosis.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **gnomAD v2.1.1 Scores:**\n    *   **pLI:** 4.19e-10 (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant is near zero).\n    *   **LOEUF:** 1.10 (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction).\n    *   **pRec:** 0.00\n    *   **pNull:** 1.00\n*   **Clinical Interpretation:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that *SLC34A1* is tolerant to heterozygous loss-of-function variation, which is consistent with the recessive inheritance pattern of severe disease. The dominant phenotype is not caused by simple haploinsufficiency.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Biallelic missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations are associated with recessive disease. Heterozygous missense mutations are the most common cause of the dominant form.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Nephrocalcinosis (HP:0000121)\n    *   Hypercalciuria (HP:0003471)\n    *   Hypophosphatemia (HP:0002148)\n    *   Nephrolithiasis (HP:0000787)\n    *   Hypercalcemia (HP:0003072)\n    *   Renal phosphate wasting / Hyperphosphaturia (HP:0003108 / HP:0002908)\n    *   Failure to thrive (HP:0001508)\n    *   Decreased bone mineral density (HP:0000938)\n    *   Osteoporosis (HP:0000939)\n    *   Proximal tubulopathy (HP:0001970)\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Vomiting (HP:0002013)\n    *   Polyuria (HP:0000103)\n    *   Metabolic acidosis (HP:0001942)\n    *   Hypophosphatemic rickets (HP:0008898)\n    *   Bone pain (HP:0002653)\n    *   Dehydration (HP:0001944)\n*   **Age of Onset:** Onset can be in infancy with severe symptoms like failure to thrive and hypercalcemia. Alternatively, presentation can be in adulthood with nephrolithiasis or osteoporosis.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity is highly variable, even within families. Biallelic mutations are associated with a more severe, early-onset phenotype compared to monoallelic mutations. Digenic inheritance of heterozygous mutations in both *SLC34A1* and *SLC34A3* can result in a more severe phenotype than a single heterozygous mutation.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Biallelic Variants:** Typically cause autosomal recessive infantile hypercalcemia or Fanconi-like syndrome with severe renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, and subsequent hypercalcemia.\n*   **Monoallelic Variants:** Cause a milder, autosomal dominant phenotype of hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis and/or osteoporosis, often presenting in adulthood.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Strong. There is a clear distinction between the severe, recessive phenotypes caused by biallelic mutations and the milder, dominant phenotypes caused by heterozygous mutations.\n*   **Examples:**\n    *   **p.I456N (heterozygous):** Associated with autosomal dominant renal stone disease.\n    *   **p.R512C and p.V91A97del (compound heterozygous):** Associated with an autosomal recessive Fanconi-like syndrome with metabolic acidosis and renal stones.\n    *   **p.Gly543Cys (heterozygous):** A novel variant associated with recurrent nephrolithiasis and early-onset osteopenia.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n| HGVS / rsID | ClinVar Significance | Reported Phenotypes (HPO Terms) | Allele Frequency (gnomAD) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| p.Val408Glu / rs140649226 | Pathogenic | Hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis 1, Infantile hypercalcemia 2 | 0.00011 |\n| p.Ile456Asn | Pathogenic | Hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis | Not reported |\n| p.Arg512Cys / rs769018485 | Pathogenic | Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 | Very rare |\n| p.V91_A97del | Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic | Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2 | More common |\n| p.Arg512His / rs199679198 | Pathogenic | Hypophosphatemic rickets, Hypercalciuria | 0.000008 |\n| p.Gly543Cys | Uncertain Significance | Nephrolithiasis, Osteopenia | Not reported |\n| p.Thr138Met | Pathogenic | Infantile hypercalcemia 2 | Not reported |\n| p.Val147Met | Pathogenic | Infantile hypercalcemia 2 | Not reported |\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues:** The highest expression of *SLC34A1* is in the kidney cortex, according to GTEx data.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes:** The kidney-specific expression of the NaPi-IIa protein explains why phenotypes are primarily renal, including defective phosphate reabsorption, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Clinical presentations in early infancy suggest the gene is critical for phosphate homeostasis from birth.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The *SLC34A1* gene encodes the sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter 2A (NaPi-IIa), which is critical for reabsorbing phosphate from the glomerular filtrate in the kidney's proximal tubule.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:**\n    *   **Recessive (Loss-of-Function):** Biallelic mutations lead to a loss of NaPi-IIa transporter function, causing renal phosphate wasting. This results in hypophosphatemia, which stimulates 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 production, leading to increased intestinal calcium absorption and subsequent hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.\n    *   **Dominant:** The mechanism for dominant disease is less clear but may involve trafficking defects or a dominant-negative effect where the mutant protein interferes with the function of the wild-type protein.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** The primary pathway disrupted is sodium-coupled phosphate transport in the renal brush border membrane. This dysregulation of phosphate homeostasis has downstream effects on the vitamin D metabolic pathway.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** In a cohort of patients with a history suggestive of hypersensitivity to vitamin D (hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria), mutations in *SLC34A1* were identified in 1-8% of cases, less frequently than *CYP24A1* mutations.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** The gene is tested in cases of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia, Fanconi syndrome, and unexplained hypophosphatemia, nephrolithiasis, or early-onset osteoporosis.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management:** Management is often personalized due to phenotype variability. It includes hyperhydration, dietary modifications (low sodium, appropriate calcium), and potentially phosphate supplementation, which can rapidly resolve hypercalcemia in infants with biallelic mutations.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Both autosomal recessive and dominant inheritance must be considered. Heterozygous carriers of a recessive allele may be asymptomatic or have mild biochemical changes.

        "DNAH9": "DNAH9 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n\u2013 **HGNC ID:** 2953\n\u2013 **OMIM Gene ID:** 603330\n\u2013 **Primary Disease Associations:** DNAH9 is primarily associated with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia-40 (CILD40), which often presents with laterality defects such as situs inversus totalis and heterotaxy syndrome. Biallelic mutations have also been linked to nonsyndromic severe asthenozoospermia and complex congenital heart disease.\n\u2013 **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between biallelic DNAH9 mutations and primary ciliary dyskinesia with laterality defects is considered to have high evidence (\"Green List\" on PanelApp).\n\u2013 **Inheritance Patterns:** The mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\u2013 **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    - The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint scores for DNAH9 are: pLI = 1.00, LOEUF = 0.12 (90% CI: 0.10-0.15).\n    - The pRec score is 0.000 and the pNull score is 0.000.\n\u2013 **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The high pLI score (\u2265 0.9) and low LOEUF score (< 0.35) indicate that DNAH9 is extremely intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variants. This suggests a strong selective pressure against heterozygous protein-truncating variants and that the gene is likely essential for normal function.\n\u2013 **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Loss-of-function variants (e.g., frameshift, nonsense) and missense variants have been reported as pathogenic. Biallelic LoF mutations are associated with a complete loss of ciliary function.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\u2013 **Primary HPO terms:**\n    - Situs inversus totalis (HP:0001692)\n    - Heterotaxy syndrome (HP:0001676)\n    - Recurrent respiratory infections (HP:0002205)\n    - Bronchiectasis (HP:0002110)\n    - Congenital heart defects (e.g., Atrial septal defect, Ventricular septal defect) (HP:0001627)\n    - Male infertility (HP:0000789) / Asthenozoospermia (HP:0000815)\n    - Chronic rhinosinusitis (HP:0011109)\n    - Wet cough (HP:0030635)\n    - Reduced ciliary beat frequency (HP:0012251)\n    - Abnormal ciliary motility (HP:0012250)\n\u2013 **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    - Polysplenia (HP:0001716)\n    - Obstructive ventilatory defect (HP:0002871)\n    - Low nasal nitric oxide level (HP:0030386)\n    - Morphological central nervous system abnormality (HP:0002011)\n    - Jejunal atresia (HP:0002242)\n\u2013 **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset can be congenital, with laterality defects and heart conditions identified at birth. Respiratory symptoms may present in childhood and persist.\n\u2013 **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype can range from mild, with subtle respiratory symptoms, to severe, with complex congenital heart disease and significant respiratory disease. Some individuals may present only with nonsyndromic male infertility.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\u2013 **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Biallelic loss-of-function mutations typically result in laterality defects and may have milder respiratory symptoms than classic PCD. Compound heterozygous missense and LoF mutations can lead to complex congenital heart disease. Some missense variants have been associated with nonsyndromic severe asthenozoospermia without other classic PCD symptoms.\n\u2013 **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The specific location of mutations within the DNAH9 protein domains and their correlation to phenotype is not yet well-established due to the limited number of reported cases.\n\u2013 **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** There is a moderate to strong correlation, with biallelic LoF variants consistently leading to laterality defects. However, the severity of respiratory and cardiac phenotypes shows variability.\n\u2013 **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    - c.10127dupT (p.Leu3376Phefs*57) is associated with situs inversus totalis.\n    - Compound heterozygosity for c.11176C>T (p.Arg3726Trp) and a splice site mutation c.3743+1G>T was identified in a fetus with complex congenital heart disease.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n\u2013 A selection of reported variants includes:\n    - **c.760_761delTT (p.Phe254Leufs\\*6):** Pathogenic, associated with Kartagener syndrome, situs inversus, bronchiectasis. AF in gnomAD is 4.779e-5.\n    - **c.4331G>A (p.Trp1444\\*):** Likely pathogenic nonsense mutation associated with Kartagener syndrome. Not found in gnomAD.\n    - **c.5641A>G (p.Lys1881Glu):** Pathogenic missense variant found in a complex allele in a patient with CILD40 and situs inversus. Not found in gnomAD.\n    - **c.8894G>A (p.Arg2965His):** Pathogenic missense variant part of a complex allele in a patient with CILD40 and situs inversus. AF in gnomAD is 5.8e-5.\n    - **c.308dupT (p.Leu104Profs\\*45):** Loss-of-function variant associated with laterality defects.\n    - **c.11666C>G (p.Ser3889\\*):** Loss-of-function variant associated with laterality defects.\n    - **c.1997G>A (p.Trp666\\*):** Loss-of-function variant associated with heterotaxy with situs inversus and polysplenia.\n    - **p.(Ala1217GlnfsTer4):** Likely pathogenic frameshift variant associated with PCD.\n    - **p.(Gly1698Asp):** Variant of Uncertain Significance, found in a compound heterozygous state with a likely pathogenic variant in a patient with PCD.\n\u2013 **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** Biallelic truncating mutations, such as frameshift and nonsense variants, show strong evidence for causing a CILD40 phenotype with laterality defects.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\u2013 **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, DNAH9 is highly expressed in the testis, lung, and brain (specifically the hypothalamus, caudate, and hippocampus). Expression is also noted in respiratory epithelia.\n\u2013 **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the lungs correlates with the respiratory symptoms (PCD). Expression in the testis is consistent with its role in flagellar movement and the associated male infertility phenotype.\n\u2013 **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression in embryonic nodal cells is crucial for establishing left-right body asymmetry, explaining the laterality defects when the gene is mutated.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\u2013 **Normal Gene Function:** DNAH9 encodes a heavy chain of the outer dynein arm (ODA) in motile cilia and flagella, which generates force for their movement by hydrolyzing ATP.\n\u2013 **Disease Mechanism:** The primary disease mechanism is loss-of-function, arising from biallelic mutations. This leads to impaired ciliary and flagellar motility. Some research suggests that certain mutations may not cause a complete loss of function, leading to milder or different phenotypes.\n\u2013 **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    - Disruption of DNAH9 function impairs the assembly of outer dynein arms in the distal part of the cilium, leading to defective ciliary beating.\n    - In the embryonic node, this disrupted motility of monocilia prevents the normal leftward flow required for establishing body laterality, resulting in situs inversus or heterotaxy.\n    - In the respiratory tract, impaired mucociliary clearance leads to recurrent infections and bronchiectasis.\n    - In sperm, defective flagellar movement results in asthenozoospermia and male infertility.\n\u2013 **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** DNAH9 interacts with other ODA components like DNAH5 and DNAI2, and with the ODA-docking complex component CCDC114. It also interacts with GAS8. The absence of DNAH9 leads to the loss of these other proteins from the distal axoneme.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\u2013 **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Targeted next-generation sequencing panels for PCD have a high diagnostic yield, identifying disease-causing variants in a large percentage of cases. The inclusion of DNAH9 in these panels is important for diagnosing individuals with laterality defects, who may have only subtle respiratory symptoms.\n\u2013 **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for DNAH9 is indicated in patients with clinical suspicion of PCD, especially those presenting with laterality defects (situs inversus, heterotaxy), congenital heart disease, and/or unexplained male infertility.\n\u2013 **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** A genetic diagnosis confirms PCD, guides monitoring for respiratory disease progression (e.g., lung function tests, imaging), and informs management strategies to prevent complications from chronic infections. It also allows for prenatal and familial genetic counseling.\n\u2013 **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Couples with a child affected by a DNAH9-related disorder should be counseled on the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and the 25% recurrence risk in future pregnancies. The phenotypic variability, from mild respiratory issues to severe heart defects, should be discussed.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\u2013 **PMID: 30471718, 2018:** Landmark study establishing that recessive, loss-of-function mutations in DNAH9 cause laterality defects with subtle respiratory phenotypes, defining its role in distal ciliary axoneme assembly.\n\u2013 **PMID: 30471717, 2018:** Concurrently published paper confirming biallelic DNAH9 mutations cause motile cilia defects and situs inversus in multiple families.\n\u2013 **PMID: 33654763, 2021:** Report on novel compound heterozygous missense variants in DNAH9 leading to nonsyndromic severe asthenozoospermia, expanding the phenotype to include isolated male infertility.\n\u2013 **PMID: 35729148, 2022:** Study using Dnah9 knockdown mice and organoids that recapitulated key PCD symptoms, including impaired lung function and mucin accumulation, and demonstrated interaction with CCDC114 and GAS8.\n\u2013 **PMID: 36802875, 2023:** Case report of a patient with Kartagener syndrome and severe clinical manifestations due to novel compound heterozygous mutations (one frameshift, one nonsense), highlighting phenotypic severity.\n\u2013 **PMID: 35116053, 2022:** Report linking biallelic DNAH9 mutations to complex congenital heart disease in Chinese patients, reinforcing the gene's critical role in cardiac development.\n\u2013 **PMID: 34335198, 2021:** Review article highlighting genotype-phenotype relationships in PCD, noting that DNAH9 mutations can be associated with milder respiratory symptoms compared to mutations in other PCD genes.\n\u2013 **PMID: 35942484, 2022:** Case study demonstrating the utility of combining genetic analysis with functional tests to classify a DNAH9 variant of uncertain significance.\n\u2013 **PMID: 32664082, 2020:** Large cohort study on PCD genetics that identified DNAH9 as a cause of laterality defects.\n\u2013 **DOI: 10.1007/s00431-024-05562-x, 2024:** Recent case study identifying a novel compound heterozygous mutation in DNAH9 causing complex CHD, further expanding the mutational spectrum.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\u2013 **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    - Biallelic loss-of-function variants (frameshift, nonsense, essential splice site) are strongly associated with **Situs inversus totalis (HP:0001692)**, **Heterotaxy syndrome (HP:0001676)**, and often milder forms of **Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (HP:0001678)**.\n    - Compound heterozygous variants involving at least one missense mutation may be associated with severe **Congenital heart defects (HP:0001627)**.\n    - Certain compound heterozygous missense variants are associated with isolated **Asthenozoospermia (HP:0000815)** without overt respiratory or laterality defects.\n\u2013 **Phenotype red flags:**\n    - The presence of any laterality defect (e.g., situs inversus, dextrocardia, polysplenia) is a major red flag for pathogenic DNAH9 variants, even with mild or absent respiratory symptoms.\n    - The combination of laterality defects with congenital heart disease strongly suggests considering DNAH9.\n    - Unexplained severe asthenozoospermia in males should prompt consideration of DNAH9 sequencing.\n\u2013 **Differential diagnosis considerations:**\n    - The phenotype of DNAH9-related ciliopathy overlaps with other genes causing PCD, particularly those associated with outer dynein arm defects like **DNAH5** and **DNAI1**. However, DNAH5 mutations often cause more severe, classic PCD with immotile cilia, whereas DNAH9 defects are more subtle.\n    - It also overlaps with genes causing heterotaxy and complex congenital heart disease without a primary respiratory phenotype. The presence of even mild respiratory symptoms or male infertility can help prioritize DNAH9.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in DNAH9 (1/1):\nN/A.

Thyroid expression may relate to hypothyroidism.\n*   **Expression During Development**: The gene is expressed starting early in embryonic development, consistent with its role in a congenital disorder.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: UBR7 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, a component of the N-end rule pathway that recognizes and targets proteins for degradation.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The mechanism for Li-Campeau syndrome is loss-of-function resulting from bi-allelic pathogenic variants, consistent with haploinsufficiency not being the primary mechanism.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**: Disruption of UBR7 function impairs the Notch signaling pathway, a critical pathway for development. UBR7 also functions as a histone H2B monoubiquitin ligase and an H3 chaperone, suggesting that epigenetic dysregulation contributes to the phenotype.\n*   **Protein-protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: UBR7 interacts with UBR5 in the Notch signaling pathway.

Cases are often described as having total globozoospermia.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous loss-of-function variants are consistently associated with globozoospermia.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The pathogenic missense mutation c.848G\u2192A (p.Arg283Gln) affects the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, which is critical for protein-protein interactions involved in acrosome biogenesis.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Strong. Biallelic pathogenic variants in `SPATA16` are reliably predictive of a globozoospermia phenotype.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   Homozygous c.848G\u2192A (p.Arg283Gln) results in classic globozoospermia with round-headed, acrosomeless sperm.\n    *   A homozygous deletion of exon 2 leads to a severe phenotype of total globozoospermia with high levels of sperm DNA fragmentation.\n    *   Defects in `SPATA16` may be associated with more complex morphological abnormalities, such as multi-headed and multi-flagellated sperm, compared to defects in `DPY19L2`.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.848G>A (p.Arg283Gln):** Pathogenic; Associated with globozoospermia and round-headed acrosomeless sperm.\n*   **Homozygous deletion of exon 2:** Pathogenic; Associated with severe total globozoospermia and significant DNA fragmentation.\n*   **Homozygous deletion of part of exon 1:** Pathogenic; Associated with globozoospermia.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues:** Expression is highest in the testis, with significantly more expression in adult versus fetal testes. This testis-specific expression profile directly explains the confined phenotype.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in testicular tissue and localization to the Golgi apparatus of spermatids is directly correlated with its role in acrosome formation, leading to an exclusive male infertility phenotype.\n*   **Expression During Development:** The protein is critical during the post-pubertal stage of spermiogenesis, the differentiation phase of sperm development.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** `SPATA16` encodes a testis-specific protein that is essential for the formation of the sperm acrosome during spermiogenesis.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The established mechanism is loss-of-function resulting from biallelic pathogenic variants. This disrupts the formation of the acrosome, a specialized vesicle required for sperm-egg fusion.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** The SPATA16 protein localizes to the Golgi apparatus and pro-acrosomal vesicles; mutations impair the proper transport and fusion of these vesicles to form the single acrosomal cap on the sperm head.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions:** SPATA16 is part of a protein network involved in acrosome biogenesis that includes GOPC and PICK1, mutations in which also cause globozoospermia.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** While the overall diagnostic yield in cohorts of infertile men is low, `SPATA16` is a key causative gene in the specific and rare subtype of teratozoospermia known as globozoospermia (prevalence <0.1%).\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** The primary indication for `SPATA16` gene testing is a semen analysis showing globozoospermia.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** A molecular diagnosis confirms the etiology of infertility, informs genetic counseling regarding recurrence risk, and guides clinical management, typically toward intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the autosomal recessive inheritance, parents of an affected individual are obligate carriers. Siblings of an affected individual have a 25% chance of being affected and a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Dam, A. H. D. M., et al. (2007), PMID: 17847006:** This landmark study first reported that a homozygous mutation in `SPATA16` causes globozoospermia, establishing the first single-gene defect for a nonsyndromic male infertility condition.\n*   **Zhu, F., et al. (2016):** Described a novel homozygous deletion of exon 2 in `SPATA16` in patients with total globozoospermia, expanding the known pathogenic mutational spectrum. [Referenced in 7, 15, 25]\n*   **Dai, C., et al. (2017), PMID: 29057134:** Utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to create mouse models, which confirmed that `Spata16` is essential for male fertility but surprisingly revealed a more severe phenotype of complete spermiogenic arrest rather than globozoospermia in mice.\n*   **Elouej, S., et al. (2020):** This comparative study found that globozoospermia caused by `SPATA16` mutations can present with more severe morphological sperm defects (e.g., multiple heads/tails) and higher aneuploidy rates than cases caused by `DPY19L2` mutations. [Referenced in 16, 17]\n*   **Xu, M., et al. (2003), PMID: 12529416:** Initially characterized the `SPATA16` gene (then called `NYD-SP12`), demonstrating its specific expression in the testis and localization to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting its role in spermatogenesis. [Referenced in 3, 16]\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Homozygous loss-of-function variants in `SPATA16` are strongly associated with the HPO term Globozoospermia (HP:0012869), which encompasses Acrosomeless sperm (HP:0012870) and Sperm head anomaly (HP:0012861).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The observation of round-headed, acrosomeless sperm (globozoospermia) on semen analysis is the single most critical phenotypic red flag that should prompt consideration of `SPATA16` variant analysis.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The differential diagnosis for monogenic globozoospermia is limited but includes other genes critical for acrosome biogenesis. The most common cause is deletions or mutations in `DPY19L2`. Other causative genes include `PICK1`, `GOPC`, `AURKC`, and `CSNK2A2`.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in SPATA16 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "PRSS1": "PRSS1 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** PRSS1 (HGNC: 9475).\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 276000.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Hereditary Pancreatitis (PCTT) (MIM: 167800). It is also associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between PRSS1 and hereditary chronic pancreatitis is classified as \"Definitive\" by ClinGen.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** PRSS1-related hereditary pancreatitis is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Some cases may arise from de novo pathogenic variants.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v4.0 constraint metrics for PRSS1 are not available as of the latest update. However, the concept of pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) helps classify genes, with a pLI \u2265 0.9 indicating intolerance to protein-truncating variants. Low LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) scores are also indicative of strong intolerance to loss-of-function variation.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A high pLI score suggests that loss-of-function variants in the gene are not tolerated, often associating them with dominant diseases. For PRSS1, the disease mechanism is gain-of-function, not loss-of-function, so these specific scores are less informative for pathogenicity assessment than for other genes.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Pathogenic variants are typically missense mutations that lead to a gain-of-function. Copy number variants (duplications) and gene conversion events have also been reported as pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Recurrent pancreatitis (HP:0001740)\n    *   Chronic pancreatitis (HP:0001736)\n    *   Pancreatic calcification (HP:0005239)\n    *   Abdominal pain (HP:0002027)\n    *   Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (HP:0001734)\n    *   Steatorrhea (HP:0002018)\n    *   Diabetes mellitus (HP:0000819)\n    *   Pancreatic cancer (HP:0006282)\n    *   Nausea and vomiting (HP:0002018)\n    *   Weight loss (HP:0001824)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Pancreatic pseudocyst (HP:0005244)\n    *   Jaundice (HP:0000952)\n    *   Malabsorption (HP:0002024)\n    *   Pancreatic ductal dilatation (HP:0030768)\n    *   Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is highly variable, often occurring in childhood or early adulthood. In one study of the p.A16V mutation, the median age of onset was 10 years. Another study involving the R122C mutation reported a mean onset age of 23.5 years.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The clinical presentation ranges from mild, with occasional episodes of acute pancreatitis, to severe, with progression to chronic pancreatitis, exocrine and endocrine insufficiency, and a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Penetrance of pathogenic variants is incomplete and variable.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Gain-of-function missense variants are the primary cause of hereditary pancreatitis. Some variants, such as p.R122H and p.N29I, are considered high-penetrance, while others, like p.A16V and p.R122C, have lower penetrance. Certain missense mutations can lead to protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum stress.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The majority of pathogenic mutations are located in the N-terminal activation peptide or at key cleavage sites, affecting autoactivation or degradation of trypsinogen. For example, the p.R122H mutation at a primary cleavage site prevents trypsin degradation.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is strong for high-penetrance variants like p.R122H and p.N29I leading to hereditary pancreatitis. For lower-penetrance variants such as p.A16V, the phenotype is more variable and may depend on other genetic or environmental factors.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   **p.Arg122His (R122H):** Strongly associated with hereditary pancreatitis and increased risk for pancreatic cancer; it prevents trypsin from being broken down.\n    *   **p.Asn29Ile (N29I):** A high-penetrance variant that enhances autoactivation of trypsinogen.\n    *   **p.Ala16Val (A16V):** Associated with a variable phenotype and incomplete penetrance, suggesting a role in multigenic inheritance.\n    *   **p.Arg122Cys (R122C):** A lower-penetrance variant associated with pancreatitis, diabetes, and pancreatic cancer.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **p.Arg122His (c.365G>A):** Pathogenic / Reported phenotypes: Hereditary pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer (HP:0001736, HP:0006282) / AF: Low.\n*   **p.Asn29Ile (c.86A>T):** Pathogenic / Reported phenotypes: Hereditary pancreatitis (HP:0001736) / AF: Low.\n*   **p.Ala16Val (c.47C>T):** Pathogenic / Reported phenotypes: Hereditary pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer (HP:0001736, HP:0006282) / AF: Low.\n*   **p.Arg122Cys (c.365G>T):** Pathogenic / Reported phenotypes: Hereditary pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, pancreatic cancer (HP:0001736, HP:0000819, HP:0006282) / AF: Low.\n*   **p.Gly208Ala (c.623G>C):** Pathogenic / Reported phenotypes: Chronic pancreatitis (HP:0001736) / AF: Low.\n*   **p.Arg116Cys (c.346C>T):** Pathogenic / Reported phenotypes: Chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer (HP:0001736, HP:0006282) / AF: Low.\n*   **p.Glu190Lys (c.568G>A):** Likely Pathogenic / Reported phenotypes: Chronic pancreatitis (HP:0001736) / AF: Novel.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** PRSS1 shows the highest expression in the pancreas.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The highly specific expression in the pancreas directly correlates with the primary phenotype of pancreatitis. Pathogenic variants lead to premature activation of trypsin within the pancreas, causing autodigestion and inflammation.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** While expression data across different developmental stages is limited, the typical onset of hereditary pancreatitis in childhood suggests significant expression and functional importance early in life.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The PRSS1 gene encodes cationic trypsinogen, a digestive enzyme precursor produced in the pancreas that is activated to trypsin in the small intestine to digest proteins.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is gain-of-function, where mutations either enhance the autoactivation of trypsinogen to trypsin or inhibit the degradation of active trypsin within the pancreas. A secondary mechanism involves protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum stress.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** Pathogenic variants disrupt the delicate balance of protease-antiprotease activity in the pancreas, leading to premature and excessive trypsin activity. This triggers a cascade of digestive enzyme activation, leading to pancreatic autodigestion, inflammation, and cell death. The JAK1/STAT5 signaling pathway has been implicated in mediating the effects of some PRSS1 mutations on pancreatic cancer progression.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Trypsinogen's interaction with chymotrypsin C (CTRC), which mediates its degradation, is critical. Some PRSS1 mutations make trypsinogen resistant to CTRC cleavage, contributing to increased trypsin levels. The balance with the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (SPINK1) is also crucial for preventing premature trypsin activation.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In children with recurrent acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis, PRSS1 pathogenic variants can be found in 17% and 46% of cases, respectively. In adults with chronic pancreatitis of unknown cause, the prevalence varies, with one German study reporting pathogenic variants in about 5% of cases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Testing is indicated for individuals with recurrent acute pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis with onset before age 25, or a family history of pancreatitis consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identifying a pathogenic PRSS1 variant confirms a diagnosis of hereditary pancreatitis, guides management (e.g., pain control, pancreatic enzyme replacement), and indicates the need for surveillance for diabetes and pancreatic cancer. It also allows for predictive testing of at-risk family members.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, the 50% risk to offspring, the concept of reduced penetrance, and the availability of prenatal or preimplantation genetic testing. The significant lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer for carriers is a key point for discussion.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 33257277, 2021:** This review classifies PRSS1 variants based on their deleterious effect, providing guidance for clinical interpretation in patients with pancreatitis by considering in vitro data and allele frequencies.\n*   **PMID: 31728256, 2019:** Demonstrated that the T/C PRSS1 genotype was associated with larger tumor size and poorer overall survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, suggesting its use as a prognostic factor.\n*   **PMID: 31525287, 2019:** Investigated a PRSS1 mutation (R116C), finding it promoted malignant behaviors in pancreatic cancer cells and induced early neoplastic lesions in a mouse model, implicating the JAK1-STAT5 pathway.\n*   **PMID: 30723467, 2019:** Reported a novel p.Glu190Lys variant in a patient with chronic pancreatitis and showed through functional studies that it increases trypsinogen autoactivation, classifying it as likely pathogenic.\n*   **PMID: 19453252, 2009:** Characterized the variable phenotype of the p.A16V mutation, noting its family-dependent penetrance and suggesting it contributes to a multigenic predisposition to pancreatitis.\n*   **PMID: 19266188, 2009:** Described the clinical features of the R122C mutation in six families, highlighting lower penetrance than other common mutations but a significant risk for diabetes and pancreatic cancer.\n*   **PMID: 18195514, 2008:** Identified a new polymorphism (c.488 C > T) associated with chronic pancreatitis and a mutation (c.361 G > A) correlated with hereditary pancreatitis in a Chinese cohort.\n*   **PMID: 8841182, 1996:** Landmark study that first identified mutations in the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1) as the cause of hereditary pancreatitis, establishing the genetic basis of the disease.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   **p.Arg122His and p.Asn29Ile:** Strongly associated with Recurrent pancreatitis (HP:0001740) and Chronic pancreatitis (HP:0001736) with high penetrance.\n    *   **All pathogenic gain-of-function variants:** Associated with an increased risk of Pancreatic cancer (HP:0006282) and Diabetes mellitus (HP:0000819) as disease complications.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:**\n    *   The presence of Recurrent pancreatitis (HP:0001740) or Chronic pancreatitis (HP:0001736), especially with a childhood or early adult onset, strongly suggests considering PRSS1 testing.\n    *   A family history of pancreatitis in multiple generations following an autosomal dominant pattern is a major red flag.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:**\n    *   Phenotypes overlap with pancreatitis caused by mutations in other genes such as **SPINK1, CFTR, CTRC,** and **CPA1**. Multigene panels are often considered for diagnosis.\n    *   Alcoholic and idiopathic pancreatitis must also be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PRSS1 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "SLX4": "SLX4 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 23845.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 613278.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Biallelic mutations in SLX4 are the cause of Fanconi anemia, complementation group P (FANCP).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between biallelic SLX4 mutations and Fanconi anemia, complementation group P, is considered definitive. The role of monoallelic variants in hereditary breast or ovarian cancer has been refuted or is considered to have no known disease relationship.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The inheritance pattern for Fanconi anemia, complementation group P, is autosomal recessive (biallelic).\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint scores for SLX4 are pLI = 1.00 and LOEUF = 0.16 (decile 1). A high pLI score (close to 1.0) indicates intolerance to loss-of-function variation. A low LOEUF score is also indicative of strong intolerance to loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The high pLI and low LOEUF scores suggest that SLX4 is highly intolerant to loss-of-function variants, and such variants are under strong negative selection in the general population. This is consistent with its role in a severe recessive disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) that lead to loss of function are the most common pathogenic variant class. Biallelic mutations are required to cause Fanconi anemia.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001511: Intrauterine growth retardation.\n    *   HP:0000252: Microcephaly.\n    *   HP:0000518: Cataract.\n    *   HP:0001250: Seizures.\n    *   HP:0001629: Ventricular septal defect.\n    *   HP:0001636: Atrial septal defect.\n    *   HP:0000969: Cafe-au-lait spot.\n    *   HP:0000953: Hyperpigmentation of the skin.\n    *   HP:0002817: Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the thumb.\n    *   HP:0009601: Aplasia/Hypoplasia of the radius.\n    *   HP:0001875: Pancytopenia.\n    *   HP:0001903: Anemia.\n    *   HP:0001915: Bone marrow failure.\n    *   HP:0001974: Acute myeloid leukemia.\n    *   HP:0002664: Neoplasm.\n    *   HP:0002857: Squamous cell carcinoma.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0000407: Sensorineural hearing impairment.\n    *   HP:0000347: Micrognathia.\n    *   HP:0000175: Cleft palate.\n    *   HP:0001763: Talipes equinovarus.\n    *   HP:0000023: Inguinal hernia.\n    *   HP:0000028: Cryptorchidism.\n    *   HP:0001263: Global developmental delay.\n    *   HP:0001156: Brachydactyly.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The features of Fanconi anemia are typically present from birth (congenital abnormalities) or develop in early childhood (bone marrow failure). Malignancies tend to occur in the second or third decade of life.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype in patients with SLX4 mutations can be milder compared to those with mutations in homologous recombination genes like BRCA2. However, some patients exhibit a severe phenotype with early mortality.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and their Typical Phenotypes:** Biallelic loss-of-function mutations (e.g., truncating, splice site, or large deletions) are required to cause the full spectrum of Fanconi anemia, complementation group P.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Deletion of the UBZ domain (ubiquitin-binding zinc finger) is specifically linked to impaired interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair and sensitivity to ICL-inducing agents, which is a key cellular phenotype of Fanconi anemia.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is strong; biallelic loss-of-function variants are consistently associated with the clinical and cellular phenotypes of Fanconi anemia.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** Patients with biallelic truncating mutations exhibit classic Fanconi anemia features, including radial ray defects, growth retardation, skin pigmentation abnormalities, and bone marrow failure. A patient with a homozygous deletion of the UBZ domain presented with Fanconi anemia.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   A list of pathogenic variants reported in ClinVar can be found online. The specific phenotypic details for each variant are often limited in public databases but are documented in the initial case reports.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** The initial reports of SLX4 mutations described large deletions and frameshift mutations in patients with a clear diagnosis of Fanconi anemia, providing the strongest evidence.\n    *   **c.2206_2209del (p.Ile736Argfs\\*2):** Pathogenic, associated with Fanconi anemia.\n    *   **c.4550_4553del (p.Lys1517Argfs\\*4):** Pathogenic, associated with Fanconi anemia.\n    *   **Large genomic deletion:** A homozygous deletion of exons 8-10 was identified in a patient with Fanconi anemia.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** SLX4 shows low tissue specificity and is expressed across a wide range of tissues. Highest expression is noted in tissues with high rates of cell turnover, including testis and transformed lymphocytes (EBV-transformed).\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in hematopoietic cells aligns with the prominent bone marrow failure phenotype. The risk of squamous cell carcinomas and other solid tumors reflects its role in maintaining genomic stability in epithelial tissues.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The gene's fundamental role in DNA repair is critical during embryonic development, leading to congenital abnormalities when deficient. The cumulative effect of genome instability over time leads to age-related phenotypes like bone marrow failure and cancer.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** SLX4 is a scaffold protein that assembles and regulates multiple structure-specific endonucleases (SLX1, MUS81-EME1, XPF-ERCC1) to resolve DNA recombination and replication intermediates and repair DNA damage.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism is loss-of-function. Absence of a functional SLX4 protein scaffold impairs the recruitment and activity of key nucleases needed for DNA interstrand cross-link repair and resolving Holliday junctions.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway leads to failure of DNA interstrand cross-link repair. This results in chromosome instability, cell cycle arrest, and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, which clinically manifests as developmental defects, bone marrow failure, and cancer predisposition.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction between SLX4 and XPF-ERCC1 is critical for DNA cross-link repair. The interaction with SLX1 is key for Holliday junction resolution. The UBZ domain interacts with ubiquitylated proteins, linking SLX4 function to the broader Fanconi anemia pathway via FANCD2-FANCI ubiquitylation.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** SLX4 (FANCP) mutations are a rare cause of Fanconi anemia. Testing is typically performed as part of a multi-gene panel for Fanconi anemia or bone marrow failure syndromes.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is indicated for patients with clinical features of Fanconi anemia (e.g., radial ray defects, skin changes, short stature), early-onset bone marrow failure, or a cellular phenotype of chromosome breakage with DNA cross-linking agents.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Diagnosis of FANCP allows for specific management, including surveillance for hematologic and solid tumors, hematopoietic stem cell transplant considerations (using modified protocols for FA patients), and avoidance of DNA damaging agents.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Autosomal recessive inheritance implies a 25% recurrence risk for future siblings. Carrier testing for family members and prenatal or preimplantation genetic diagnosis are options.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 21240275 (2011):** First report identifying biallelic SLX4 mutations in two individuals with Fanconi anemia, establishing SLX4 as FANCP. Key phenotypes included bone marrow failure, radial defects, and cellular sensitivity to mitomycin C.\n*   **PMID: 21240277 (2011):** Independently reported biallelic mutations in SLX4 in individuals previously diagnosed with Fanconi anemia, confirming its role in the FA-BRCA pathway.\n*   **PMID: 21241516 (2011):** A study in a mouse model (Btbd12, the mouse ortholog of SLX4) showed that disruption of the gene phenocopies Fanconi anemia, with developmental defects, reduced fertility, cytopenias, and sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents.\n*   **PMID: 21482715 (2011):** This study demonstrated that the UBZ domain of SLX4 is required for its role in interstrand cross-link repair and links it to the upstream Fanconi anemia pathway.\n*   **PMID: 29284122 (2018):** Research using Xenopus egg extracts helped define the specific roles of SLX4 domains in ICL repair, highlighting its central role in recruiting XPF-ERCC1 to perform unhooking incisions.\n*   **PMID: 22138676 (2012):** A study in breast cancer families found no clear evidence that monoallelic SLX4 mutations contribute significantly to hereditary breast cancer risk, helping to clarify the gene's role in cancer predisposition.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Biallelic truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift) are strongly associated with a classic Fanconi anemia phenotype, including HPO terms for bone marrow failure (HP:0001915), radial ray defects (HP:0009601), and abnormal skin pigmentation (HP:0000953).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The combination of congenital anomalies (especially radial limb defects), progressive bone marrow failure in childhood, and a predisposition to AML or solid tumors strongly suggests a Fanconi anemia spectrum disorder, warranting sequencing of SLX4 and other FA genes.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of FANCP overlaps significantly with other Fanconi anemia complementation groups. It also shares features with other bone marrow failure syndromes like Diamond-Blackfan anemia and dyskeratosis congenita, and syndromes with radial defects like VACTERL association.\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in SLX4 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "HLA-DRB1": "HLA-DRB1 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: HLA-DRB1**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 4948.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 142857.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** HLA-DRB1 is primarily associated with susceptibility to a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sarcoidosis, and type 1 diabetes. It is also a critical gene in the context of organ transplantation.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Definitive evidence for its role in numerous autoimmune conditions.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The inheritance pattern is complex; it doesn't follow a simple Mendelian pattern for disease susceptibility. Instead, specific alleles act as risk factors, increasing the likelihood of developing a disease, often in combination with other genetic and environmental factors.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v4.0 database does not provide standard constraint metrics like pLI and LOEUF for HLA genes due to their high polymorphism. The extreme allelic diversity is a core feature of their function, not a sign of intolerance to variation in the typical sense.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The lack of traditional constraint scores reflects the gene's function; its variability is essential for recognizing a wide array of foreign peptides. Therefore, pathogenicity is not typically due to loss-of-function but rather to specific alleles conferring altered immune responses.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Specific missense variants (alleles) are the primary drivers of disease association. Stop-gain and frameshift variants can have a high impact, potentially leading to loss of function, though this is less commonly the mechanism of disease compared to specific allele effects.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001251 Ataxia\n    *   HP:0002061 Optic neuritis\n    *   HP:0002376 Spasticity\n    *   HP:0001269 Cerebellar ataxia\n    *   HP:0007340 Brainstem dysfunction\n    *   HP:0001257 Spastic paraplegia\n    *   HP:0002093 Cognitive impairment\n    *   HP:0001635 Cardiomyopathy\n    *   HP:0002829 Arthritis\n    *   HP:0000545 Uveitis\n    *   HP:0002721 Immunodeficiency\n    *   HP:0002753 Autoimmunity\n    *   HP:0000963 Eczema\n    *   HP:0000989 Pruritus\n    *   HP:0001510 Growth delay\n    *   HP:0001763 Pes cavus\n    *   HP:0002123 Nystagmus\n    *   HP:0002936 Interstitial pulmonary abnormality\n    *   HP:0003270 Abnormal T-cell physiology\n    *   HP:0011451 Recurrent infections\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0000572 Visual impairment\n    *   HP:0001288 Gait disturbance\n    *   HP:0002167 Sensory neuropathy\n    *   HP:0002415 Babinski sign\n    *   HP:0003477 Paresthesia\n    *   HP:0006968 Neurogenic bladder\n    *   HP:0012623 Myelitis\n    *   HP:0002027 Abdominal pain\n    *   HP:0002242 Hematochezia\n    *   HP:0002597 Weight loss\n    *   HP:0002664 Neoplasm\n    *   HP:0001892 Anemia\n    *   HP:0002715 Autoantibody positivity\n    *   HP:0010535 Pancolitis\n    *   HP:0012378 Recurrent pregnancy loss\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The age of onset varies significantly depending on the associated disease. For example, in multiple sclerosis, HLA-DRB1*15:01 is associated with a younger age of onset (around 32.4 years). For other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, it can manifest in adulthood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes is also allele- and disease-dependent. In multiple sclerosis, the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele is associated with increased disease severity, including a higher volume of white matter lesions and cognitive impairments. Conversely, alleles like HLA-DRB1*04:05 in Japanese MS patients can be associated with a milder course.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific missense variants, which define the different HLA-DRB1 alleles, are strongly correlated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. For instance, the 'shared epitope' alleles (e.g., *04:01, *04:04) are strongly linked to rheumatoid arthritis.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Variations in exon 2, which encodes the peptide-binding groove (specifically the third hypervariable region), are critical in determining T-cell recognition and are strongly associated with disease susceptibility.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between specific HLA-DRB1 alleles and autoimmune disease susceptibility is generally strong, although the presence of a risk allele does not guarantee disease development.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   **HLA-DRB1*15:01:** Strong association with multiple sclerosis, particularly in populations of Northern European descent. This allele is also linked to a younger age of onset and increased disease severity in MS.\n    *   **HLA-DRB1*04 alleles (Shared Epitope):** Associated with increased risk and severity of rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in individuals positive for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA).\n    *   **HLA-DRB1*03:01:** Linked to an increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, and sarcoidosis.\n    *   **HLA-DRB1*13:02:** Appears to have a protective effect against severe rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   This section is challenging for HLA-DRB1 as \"pathogenic variants\" are typically entire alleles rather than single nucleotide variants. Alleles are defined by a combination of variants.\n    *   **Allele: DRB1*15:01:**\n        *   **Significance:** Risk allele for Multiple Sclerosis.\n        *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Multiple sclerosis (HP:0001337), Optic neuritis (HP:0002061), Cerebellar ataxia (HP:0001269), Cognitive impairment (HP:0002093).\n    *   **Allele: DRB1*04:01:**\n        *   **Significance:** Risk allele for Rheumatoid Arthritis.\n        *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Rheumatoid arthritis (HP:0000928), Arthritis (HP:0002829), Autoantibody positivity (HP:0002715).\n    *   **Allele: DRB1*03:01:**\n        *   **Significance:** Risk allele for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Sarcoidosis.\n        *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Type I diabetes mellitus (HP:0004940), Systemic lupus erythematosus (HP:0002728), Sarcoidosis (HP:0100242), Recurrent pregnancy loss (HP:0012378).\n    *   **Allele: DRB1*08:02:**\n        *   **Significance:** Risk allele for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD).\n        *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Optic neuritis (HP:0002061), Myelitis (HP:0012623).\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** Highest expression is found in immune cells, particularly B-cells and dendritic cells. Significant expression is also seen in the spleen, lymph nodes, and whole blood.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in antigen-presenting cells directly correlates with its central role in immunity and the development of autoimmune disorders affecting various tissues targeted by the immune system. For example, high expression in immune cells infiltrating the central nervous system contributes to multiple sclerosis.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression is critical throughout life for a functional adaptive immune system. Age-related changes in the immune system (immunosenescence) can interact with HLA-DRB1-associated risks to influence the onset or severity of autoimmune diseases in later life.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The HLA-DRB1 protein is a beta chain of the MHC class II molecule, which presents peptides derived from extracellular proteins to CD4+ T-helper cells, initiating an adaptive immune response.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary disease mechanism is not haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative in the traditional sense. Instead, specific alleles (gain-of-function in a sense) have altered peptide-binding grooves that may preferentially present self-antigens or fail to present them for proper T-cell tolerance, leading to autoimmunity.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The gene is central to the \"Antigen processing and presentation\" pathway. Dysregulation of this pathway by specific HLA-DRB1 alleles leads to the activation of self-reactive T-cells, which in turn drive inflammation and tissue damage in target organs, resulting in the clinical phenotypes of autoimmune diseases like joint destruction in RA or demyelination in MS.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** HLA-DRB1 forms a heterodimer with HLA-DRA to create the functional MHC class II molecule. Its interaction with the T-cell receptor is the critical step in T-cell activation, and variations in this interaction due to different HLA-DRB1 alleles are fundamental to disease pathogenesis.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** HLA-DRB1 typing is not diagnostic on its own but provides a risk assessment. For example, in individuals with suspected MS, the presence of HLA-DRB1*15:01 increases the likelihood of the diagnosis and can have prognostic value. In rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of shared-epitope alleles supports the diagnosis, especially in ACPA-positive patients.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is commonly performed for histocompatibility matching in organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is also used in the diagnostic workup of certain autoimmune diseases like MS, celiac disease (indirectly through linkage with DQ genes), and for prognostic stratification in RA.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Knowledge of a patient's HLA-DRB1 status can influence clinical management. For instance, in RA, patients with shared-epitope alleles may be considered for more aggressive early treatment strategies. It may also be a factor in selecting therapies that target specific immune pathways.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should emphasize that HLA-DRB1 alleles are risk factors, not deterministic causes of disease. The inheritance is complex, and the risk to family members is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. The concept of \"susceptibility\" versus \"causality\" is a key point to convey.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 29910515, 2018:** This study on MS and NMOSD in a Japanese biobank identified specific genotype-phenotype correlations, such as HLA-DRB1*15:01 being associated with increased optic neuritis and cerebellar involvement in MS.\n*   **PMID: 19741121, 2009:** A landmark study demonstrating that the HLA-DRB1*1501 allele in MS patients is associated with increased disease severity, including more white matter lesions, reduced brain volume, and cognitive impairment.\n*   **PMID: 35084930, 2022:** A review highlighting the crucial role of HLA-DRB1, particularly the \"shared epitope\" alleles, in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and the potential for personalized therapy based on genotype.\n*   **PMID: 15729302, 2005:** A study on inflammatory bowel disease suggesting that specific HLA-DRB1 alleles may influence the clinical phenotype, with certain alleles associating with more aggressive disease in ulcerative colitis and specific disease locations in Crohn's disease.\n*   **PMID: 36698651, 2023:** Research indicating that the combination of the HLA-DRB1*03 phenotype and low mannose-binding lectin predisposes women with recurrent pregnancy loss to autoantibody formation.\n*   **PMID: 18544629, 2008:** A large family-based study that confirmed the strong association of DRB1*15 with MS, identified a protective effect for DRB1*14, and provided evidence for complex allelic interactions influencing MS risk.\n*   **PMID: 36151700, 2022:** An in-silico analysis of HLA-DRB1 variants, predicting the functional impact of numerous nsSNPs, indels, and stop-gain variants, underscoring the gene's vast functional polymorphism.\n*   **PMID: 36186358, 2022:** A study on cutaneous melanoma suggesting HLA-DRB1 expression as a potential prognostic factor, with higher expression correlated with better survival and a less advanced tumor stage.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   **HLA-DRB1*15:01:** Strongly associated with phenotypes of multiple sclerosis, including Optic neuritis (HP:0002061), Cerebellar ataxia (HP:0001269), Spasticity (HP:0002376), and Cognitive impairment (HP:0002093).\n    *   **HLA-DRB1 Shared Epitope alleles (e.g., *04:01, *04:04):** High confidence association with Rheumatoid arthritis (HP:0000928) and related features like Autoantibody positivity (HP:0002715).\n    *   **HLA-DRB1*03:01:** Strongly linked to phenotypes of systemic autoimmune diseases, including Systemic lupus erythematosus (HP:0002728) and Type I diabetes mellitus (HP:0004940).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:**\n    *   A combination of central nervous system demyelinating features (e.g., Optic neuritis, Myelitis) in a young adult of European ancestry strongly suggests investigating for the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele.\n    *   The presence of severe, symmetric, erosive polyarthritis, particularly with positive ACPA and rheumatoid factor, is a strong indicator for the presence of HLA-DRB1 shared-epitope alleles.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotypes associated with HLA-DRB1 alleles, such as arthritis, optic neuritis, and general autoimmunity, have a very broad differential diagnosis. Many other genes are involved in monogenic and polygenic forms of these diseases. Therefore, HLA-DRB1 status must be interpreted in the full clinical context and alongside other genetic and serological tests. For example, the phenotype of neuromyelitis optica, which overlaps with MS, has a different primary HLA association (e.g., DRB1*08:02) and is often distinguished by the presence of anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in HLA-DRB1 (2/2):\nN/A.

However, LOEUF scores are used as a continuous metric to measure a gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variation, with lower scores indicating higher constraint.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint:** Genes with high constraint scores (e.g., pLI \u2265 0.9 or low LOEUF) are often associated with dominant diseases with haploinsufficiency. The recessive nature of IGHMBP2 disorders suggests it is not haploinsufficient, but biallelic loss-of-function is pathogenic.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:**\n    *   Loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site) are commonly pathogenic.\n    *   Missense variants, particularly when located in the helicase domain, are frequently associated with the severe SMARD1 phenotype.\n    *   The complete loss-of-function of the IGHMBP2 gene is thought to be a primary cause of SMARD1.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001262: Distal muscle weakness.\n    *   HP:0001270: Motor delay.\n    *   HP:0002094: Respiratory insufficiency due to muscle weakness.\n    *   HP:0003324: Diaphragmatic paralysis/paresis.\n    *   HP:0001284: Areflexia.\n    *   HP:0001265: Hyporeflexia.\n    *   HP:0003477: Distal amyotrophy.\n    *   HP:0002515: Foot deformity.\n    *   HP:0001765: Pes cavus.\n    *   HP:0007256: Axonal neuropathy.\n    *   HP:0002875: Respiratory failure.\n    *   HP:0001511: Intrauterine growth retardation.\n    *   HP:0002194: Delayed gross motor development.\n    *   HP:0001250: Seizures.\n    *   HP:0001635: Cardiomyopathy.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001263: Global developmental delay.\n    *   HP:0100521: Intellectual disability.\n    *   HP:0001643: Patent ductus arteriosus.\n    *   HP:0001629: Ventricular septal defect.\n    *   HP:0009830: Peripheral neuropathy.\n    *   HP:0003202: Sensorineural hearing impairment.\n    *   HP:0002750: Delayed skeletal maturation.\n    *   HP:0003236: Anhidrosis/Hypohidrosis.\n    *   HP:0000545: Myopia.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:**\n    *   **Infantile:** SMARD1 typically presents in infancy, between 6 weeks and 6 months of age, with acute respiratory distress.\n    *   **Childhood:** CMT2S usually presents in the first decade with a slowly progressive neuropathy. Later-onset SMARD1 cases have also been reported.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:**\n    *   **Severe:** The classic SMARD1 phenotype is severe and often fatal in infancy due to respiratory failure.\n    *   **Moderate/Mild:** CMT2S follows a milder clinical course without primary respiratory involvement. A clinical spectrum exists, with some patients having atypical or intermediate phenotypes.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   Mutations associated with SMARD1 are frequently missense variants located within the helicase domain. Biallelic null mutations (e.g., two truncating variants) are strongly associated with the severe SMARD1 phenotype.\n    *   The CMT2S phenotype is often caused by a combination of a nonsense or frameshift mutation in the 5' region and a truncating, missense, or homozygous frameshift mutation in the last exon.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:**\n    *   Most pathogenic mutations are located in the helicase and R3H domains. Variants in the helicase domain are often linked to severe clinical phenotypes due to their impact on ATPase activity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:**\n    *   **Strong:** There is a strong correlation between the type and location of IGHMBP2 variants and the resulting clinical phenotype (SMARD1 vs. CMT2S). This correlation is linked to the level of residual IGHMBP2 protein function.\n    *   CMT2S patients have significantly higher residual IGHMBP2 protein levels compared to SMARD1 patients.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   Compound heterozygous variants c.1235+3A>G and c.1334A>C have been reported in patients with both SMARD1 and CMT2S, suggesting the influence of other genetic or environmental modifiers.\n    *   A homozygous frameshift variant c.2568_2569del (p.Gly857Alafs*27) resulted in CMT2S without respiratory distress.\n    *   Compound heterozygosity for a frameshift c.407_408del and a missense c.1737C>A (p.F579L) was identified in a patient with SMARD1.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **Pathogenic Variants (Examples):**\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.407_408del (p.Ala140Glnfs*1) / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.1737C>A (p.Phe579Leu) / **Significance:** Uncertain Significance, but reported in SMARD1 patients / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.2568_2569del (p.Gly857Alafs*27) / **Significance:** Pathogenic (novel) / **Phenotypes:** CMT2S, progressive sensorimotor neuropathy, absent deep tendon reflexes.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.1235+3A>G / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1, CMT2S.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.1334A>C (p.His445Pro) / **Significance:** Likely Pathogenic / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1, CMT2S.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.1574T>C (p.Leu525Pro) / **Significance:** Pathogenic (novel) / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.1813C>T (p.Arg605Ter) / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Phenotypes:** SMARD1, CMT2S.\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_002180.3:c.2623C>T (p.Arg788Ter) / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Phenotypes:** CMT2S.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** Biallelic null or helicase domain missense variants are strongly associated with SMARD1. According to ClinVar, there are over 140 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants reported in IGHMBP2.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** IGHMBP2 is ubiquitously expressed, but the highest expression levels are observed in the brain and spinal cord.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in motor neurons is consistent with the primary pathology of SMARD1 and CMT2S, which involves the degeneration of spinal cord motor neurons and peripheral nerves. Pathological symptoms are largely restricted to neural and muscle tissue.\n*   **Expression During Development:** IGHMBP2 is critical for the development and maintenance of the nervous system, particularly for the survival of motor neurons.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** IGHMBP2 encodes a 5' to 3' ATP-dependent helicase that unwinds DNA and RNA and is involved in transcription, ribosome biogenesis, and translation.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary disease mechanism is loss-of-function. The severity of the disease (SMARD1 vs. CMT2S) correlates inversely with the amount of residual IGHMBP2 protein.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   Disruption of IGHMBP2's role in the translational machinery, including its physical association with tRNAs and ribosomal proteins, is thought to underlie motor neuron degeneration.\n    *   Loss of IGHMBP2 modestly reduces global translation and leads to chronic activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) pathway, a cellular response implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** IGHMBP2 interacts with components of the translational machinery, including ABT1 (required for ribosome biogenesis), and transcription factor IIIC.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In patients with diseases related to IGHMBP2 mutations, SMARD1 is the more commonly identified phenotype, accounting for approximately 71% of cases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:**\n    *   Infants presenting with acute respiratory failure, diaphragmatic paralysis, and distal muscle weakness, especially if SMN1 testing is negative.\n    *   Children with a progressive, axonal, sensorimotor neuropathy consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:**\n    *   Diagnosis is critical for management, which includes respiratory support (often mechanical ventilation for SMARD1), physical therapy, and nutritional support.\n    *   Gene therapy approaches using AAV9 vectors to deliver functional IGHMBP2 have shown promise in mouse models, extending lifespan and improving motor function.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling for autosomal recessive inheritance is indicated. Given the significant phenotypic variability, even between siblings with the same mutations, predicting the precise clinical course can be challenging.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 40353295 (2025):** Expands the known clinical and genetic spectrum of IGHMBP2 disorders, highlights genotype-phenotype correlations between SMARD1 and AR-CMT2S, and identifies novel variants.\n*   **PMID: 38472481 (2024):** Review describing the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying IGHMBP2-related neurodegenerative diseases, emphasizing its helicase function in multiple cellular processes.\n*   **PMID: 38813354 (2024):** Case report of a novel homozygous frameshift variant (c.2568_2569del) causing CMT2S, expanding the phenotypic spectrum of IGHMBP2-related disease.\n*   **PMID: 38817757 (2024):** Reports on SMARD1 caused by compound heterozygous variants (c.407_408del and c.1737C>A), highlighting the correlation between residual protein levels and clinical severity.\n*   **PMID: 38352697 (2024):** First report of IGHMBP2 disorders in Vietnam, identifying a novel variant (p.Leu525Pro) and observing different phenotypes (SMARD1 vs. CMT2S) in patients with the same genotype, suggesting the role of genetic modifiers.\n*   **PMID: 37974917 (2023):** Systematic review finding that SMARD1 accounts for 71% of IGHMBP2-related disease and that complete loss-of-function is likely the mechanism for severe SMARD1.\n*   **PMID: 36070005 (2022):** Used a yeast model to validate the pathogenicity of IGHMBP2 missense variants, showing a correlation between in-vitro functional impairment and clinical phenotype.\n*   **PMID: 19158098 (2009):** Landmark study providing biochemical evidence for the role of IGHMBP2 in the translational machinery through its association with tRNAs and ribosome biogenesis factors.\n*   **Grohmann et al. (2001) *(not in provided search results, but historically significant)*:** First identified IGHMBP2 as the causative gene for SMARD1.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:**\n    *   Biallelic null mutations (frameshift, nonsense) or compound heterozygosity with a severe missense variant in the helicase domain strongly predicts a SMARD1 phenotype, characterized by early-onset respiratory failure (HP:0002875), diaphragmatic paralysis (HP:0003324), and distal amyotrophy (HP:0003477).\n    *   Compound heterozygous variants with predicted higher residual protein function (e.g., specific missense/splice variants or a null variant combined with a less severe allele) are associated with the milder CMT2S phenotype, primarily featuring axonal neuropathy (HP:0007256) and distal muscle weakness (HP:0001262) without significant respiratory distress.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:**\n    *   The combination of infantile-onset (HP:0003593) acute respiratory distress (HP:0002094) with symmetrical distal muscle weakness (HP:0001262) is highly suggestive of SMARD1 and warrants immediate IGHMBP2 testing if SMN1 is normal.\n    *   Progressive distal limb weakness and atrophy with areflexia beginning in childhood is a strong indicator for CMT2S.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**\n    *   **Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA):** Caused by SMN1 mutations. SMARD1 should be considered when SMA testing is negative in a patient with a compatible phenotype.\n    *   **Other Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) subtypes:** Axonal CMT has extensive genetic heterogeneity; overlapping phenotypes require broad gene panel testing or exome sequencing.\n    *   **Congenital Myopathies, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, and Mitochondrial Myopathy:** These should be considered in the differential for infants and children with significant muscle weakness and/or respiratory failure.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in IGHMBP2 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "PDGFRL": "PDGFRL Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: PDGFRL**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 8805.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 604584.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Primarily associated with various cancers as a tumor suppressor, including colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer. A polymorphism has also been associated with susceptibility to Behcet disease.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The role of PDGFRL as a tumor suppressor is suggested by multiple studies, but its direct causal link to a monogenic Mendelian disorder is not established; evidence is currently at a research or associative level.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Not established for a Mendelian disease; associations are primarily with somatic mutations in cancer or as a susceptibility allele for complex disease.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Specific numeric gnomAD constraint scores for PDGFRL were not available in the search results. Generally, pLI scores near 1.0 and low LOEUF scores indicate intolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) variants.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** As PDGFRL is considered a tumor suppressor, haploinsufficiency from LoF variants would be a plausible disease mechanism. However, the lack of a high pLI score may suggest that heterozygous LoF variants are not under strong negative selection in the general population or that the gene is not well-powered for this metric.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Based on its function as a tumor suppressor, pathogenic variants are expected to be loss-of-function, including nonsense, frameshift, and disruptive missense or splice site variants, as well as deletions.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** A definitive list of HPO terms is not well-established for constitutional disorders. Inferred terms based on cancer association studies include:\n    *   Colorectal carcinoma (HP:0003003).\n    *   Hepatocellular carcinoma (HP:0001402).\n    *   Non-small cell lung carcinoma (HP:0006742).\n    *   Breast carcinoma (HP:0003002).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Based on its association with Behcet disease, relevant HPO terms may include:\n    *   Recurrent oral ulcerations (HP:0000155).\n    *   Recurrent genital ulcerations (HP:0000157).\n    *   Uveitis (HP:0000554).\n    *   Skin lesions (HP:0000951).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The associated cancers are typically adult-onset.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity would range based on the specific cancer's stage and progression.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Decreased or absent expression of PDGFRL, due to somatic mutations or deletions, is associated with the development and progression of cancers like colorectal and breast cancer.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The protein has significant similarity to the ligand-binding domain of PDGFRB, suggesting variants in this region could impair its potential tumor-suppressing regulatory function.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is moderate for its role as a tumor suppressor in somatic cancers. A weak association exists between the rs17633132 polymorphism and susceptibility to Behcet disease.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** A somatic variant (VAR_026052, p.His23Tyr) has been noted in colorectal cancer. The T allele of polymorphism rs17633132 is associated with increased susceptibility to Behcet disease and decreased PDGFRL expression.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   ClinVar data from the search results is sparse for pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in PDGFRL.\n*   **rs17633132:C>T:**\n    *   **Significance:** Association/risk allele.\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Susceptibility to Behcet disease.\n    *   **AF:** Not specified in results, but is a polymorphism.\n*   **VAR_026052 / dbSNP:rs137853148 / p.His23Tyr:**\n    *   **Significance:** Somatic variant.\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Colorectal cancer.\n    *   **AF:** Not applicable (somatic).\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx):** Broadly expressed, with highest expression noted in adipose tissue (fat) and ovary. It is also highly expressed in cartilage.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Its role as a tumor suppressor has been identified in epithelial tissues giving rise to carcinomas (colon, breast, liver). Its role in chondrocytes suggests a potential phenotype related to cartilage or bone development if germline variants were identified.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression in chondrocytes suggests a role during development and maintenance of cartilage. In contrast, its tumor suppressor function is primarily relevant to adult-onset cancers.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** PDGFRL encodes a protein that functions as a tumor suppressor, likely by modulating platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor signaling.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary proposed mechanism is loss-of-function or haploinsufficiency, where decreased levels of the PDGFRL protein lead to unchecked cell proliferation and invasion.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of PDGFRL function inhibits the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and promotes cell proliferation and invasion, contributing to tumor growth. It may act within the PDGF signaling pathway, which is critical for cell growth, differentiation, and migration.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions:** Interacts with 3 proteins according to the Human Protein Atlas. It is believed to be part of a regulatory network involving the PDGF signaling pathway.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** There is currently no evidence from the search results to suggest that testing for germline PDGFRL variants has diagnostic yield for Mendelian disorders.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Testing is primarily done in a research context to investigate its role in cancer progression (somatic mutations) or for association studies in complex diseases like Behcet disease.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently limited. If its tumor suppressor role is further defined, it could become a prognostic marker or a therapeutic target in certain cancers.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For the Behcet disease-associated polymorphism, counseling would involve discussing a slightly increased risk in the context of a complex multifactorial disease.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 38851457, 2024:** Identified synonymous mutations in the PDGFRL gene in Lanping black-boned sheep that were associated with blood melanin levels, suggesting a potential role in pigmentation pathways.\n*   **PMID: 33961781, 2021:** A large-scale proteomic study identified numerous protein-protein interactions, contributing to the understanding of the cellular interactome which includes PDGFRL.\n*   **PMID: 28407304, 2017:** Found that PDGFRL is highly expressed in chondrocytes and, contrary to its effect in cancer cells, promotes their proliferation while decreasing differentiation markers, suggesting a distinct, tissue-specific function in cartilage.\n*   **PMID: 22926996, 2012:** Identified a polymorphism (rs17633132) in PDGFRL associated with susceptibility to Behcet disease, suggesting the gene may be involved in the disease by modulating its transcription.\n*   **PMID: 20333786, 2010:** Demonstrated that PDGFRL expression is lower in colorectal cancer tissues than in normal tissues and that the recombinant protein can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells, supporting its role as a tumor suppressor.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no established high-confidence germline variant-phenotype associations for PDGFRL. Somatic loss-of-function is associated with malignancies such as colorectal carcinoma (HP:0003003) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HP:0001402).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** A personal and/or family history of multiple cancers including colorectal, breast, or liver cancer, where tumor analysis shows loss of PDGFRL expression, might suggest a need for further investigation of the gene.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of cancer predisposition would overlap with numerous other genes involved in tumor suppression for colorectal cancer (e.g., APC, MLH1, MSH2), breast cancer (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53), and hepatocellular carcinoma (e.g., TP53, CTNNB1).\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PDGFRL (2/2):\nN/A.

        "IRS2": "IRS2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 6126\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 600797\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While strongly implicated in complex multifactorial diseases like Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, its role in monogenic disease is less defined. Common variants are associated with susceptibility to these conditions rather than causing them directly.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The role of rare, single-gene variants in causing a distinct Mendelian disorder is still being investigated, with evidence currently being limited or moderate for severe insulin resistance syndromes.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** For complex traits like type 2 diabetes and obesity, the inheritance is not straightforward Mendelian. Studies of rare variants in families with severe insulin resistance have not consistently shown clear co-segregation with the phenotype.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull (gnomAD v2.1.1):**\n    *   pLI (Probability of being Loss-of-function Intolerant): 0.00\n    *   LOEUF (Loss-of-function Observed/Expected Upper-bound Fraction): 1.14\n    *   pRec (Probability of being a recessive gene): Not provided.\n    *   pNull (Probability of being tolerant of both heterozygous and homozygous LoF variants): Not provided.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that *IRS2* is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While the gene is tolerant to LoF variants, specific missense variants may have a pathogenic role, potentially through mechanisms other than haploinsufficiency. Some studies focus on the functional effects of specific non-synonymous variants like Gly1057Asp.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for clinical abnormalities. While no definitive monogenic disease is linked to *IRS2*, phenotypes are inferred from its role in metabolic diseases.\n    *   Type II diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978)\n    *   Insulin resistance (HP:0000855)\n    *   Glucose intolerance (HP:0000833)\n    *   Obesity (HP:0001513)\n    *   Polycystic ovary syndrome (HP:0000062)\n    *   Hyperandrogenism (HP:0000842)\n    *   Increased waist to hip ratio (HP:0031819)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Hepatic steatosis (related to Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) (HP:0001397)\n    *   Impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (related to beta-cell dysfunction) (HP:0000849)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Typically adult-onset for complex diseases like Type 2 Diabetes.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes like insulin resistance and glucose intolerance can vary widely, influenced by genetic background and environmental factors.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   The common missense variant Gly1057Asp (rs1805097) has been extensively studied. The Gly/Gly genotype is associated with higher 2-hour glucose levels in women with PCOS, suggesting an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes.\n    *   In contrast, other studies suggest the Asp1057 allele, when combined with obesity, increases the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The IRS2 protein contains a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain and a Phosphotyrosine Binding (PTB) domain, crucial for its function in signaling. A variant (p.Ser78Asn) located in the PH domain was identified in a family with severe insulin resistance, but did not clearly co-segregate with the phenotype.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation for common variants is considered weak to moderate and highly dependent on other genetic and environmental factors like obesity. The evidence for a strong, direct correlation for rare variants causing monogenic disease is limited.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   **c.3170G>A (p.Gly1057Asp):** In obese individuals, the Asp allele is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, higher fasting plasma glucose, and higher fasting C-peptide levels. However, in non-obese individuals, it may be protective. In women with PCOS, the Gly/Gly genotype is linked to higher glucose levels.\n    *   **Haplotypes:** Complex haplotypes of *IRS2*, which include the Gly1057Asp variant, have been associated with severe obesity and glucose intolerance. For instance, haplotypes H3 and H4 were linked to increased 2-hour glucose levels in obese individuals.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   ClinVar lists one variant as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. However, most studies have focused on common polymorphisms with risk associations rather than rare, highly penetrant pathogenic variants.\n*   **rs1805097 / c.3170G>A (p.Gly1057Asp) / Risk Factor (ClinVar) /** Reported phenotypes include susceptibility to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. AF (Allele Frequency) varies by population, for example, 0.41 (Asp) in Whites and 0.15 (Asp) in African-Americans in one PCOS cohort.\n*   Several novel, rare, non-synonymous variants have been identified in patients with severe insulin resistance (e.g., p.Ser78Asn, p.Ile524Val, p.Pro829Ser, p.Ser945Phe, p.His1328Arg), but none showed clear co-segregation with the disease phenotype in family studies.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** *IRS2* shows broad expression, with notable levels in the liver, pancreas, adipose tissue, and muscle, which are key tissues for insulin signaling.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:**\n    *   **Liver:** Impaired *IRS2* function is linked to hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) and insulin resistance.\n    *   **Pancreatic \u03b2-cells:** *IRS2* is crucial for \u03b2-cell proliferation and survival, and reduced expression is associated with impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.\n    *   **Brain:** *IRS2* is involved in neuronal proliferation and survival, and its disruption may be linked to neurodegenerative processes.\n    *   **Adipose Tissue & Skeletal Muscle:** These tissues are central to insulin-mediated glucose uptake, and altered *IRS2* signaling contributes to peripheral insulin resistance.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** While knockout studies in rats show *IRS2* is important for overall growth, its role in age-related phenotypes in humans is linked to the development of metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes later in life.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *IRS2* is a cytoplasmic adaptor protein that mediates signaling from the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) receptors to downstream pathways, including the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK pathways.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism for common variants is likely altered signaling efficiency, contributing to insulin resistance as a risk factor. Haploinsufficiency is not supported by gnomAD data. Rare variants might act through other mechanisms, but this is not well established.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Insulin Signaling Pathway (KEGG: hsa04910):** Disruption in liver, muscle, and adipose tissue leads to impaired glucose uptake and regulation, resulting in hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.\n    *   **Pancreatic \u03b2-cell function:** Failure of IRS2-mediated signaling impairs the adaptive proliferation of \u03b2-cells in response to insulin resistance, leading to relative insulin deficiency.\n    *   **Hippo-YAP/TAZ and PI3K/AKT pathway:** In the liver, a positive feedback loop involving YAP/TAZ and IRS2-AKT signaling can promote hepatic steatosis and has been implicated in the progression to liver cancer.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** IRS2 interacts with the insulin receptor (INSR), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), and the regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which are critical for activating downstream metabolic and mitogenic signaling.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** Testing for rare, pathogenic *IRS2* variants in cohorts with severe insulin resistance has a very low yield, as no variants have been definitively proven to be the monogenic cause of the phenotype.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Primarily conducted in a research setting to investigate the genetic basis of metabolic disorders like severe obesity, insulin resistance, and polycystic ovary syndrome.\n*   **Clinical Actionability:** Currently, management is based on the clinical phenotype (e.g., managing diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or PCOS) rather than a specific *IRS2* genotype.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For common variants like Gly1057Asp, counseling should emphasize that these are risk factors, not deterministic causes of disease. The risk is modified by other genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. For rare variants of uncertain significance, counseling should reflect the current lack of evidence for causality.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 16184013, 2005:** A study on complex haplotypes of *IRS2* demonstrating an association with severe obesity and glucose intolerance, highlighting the heterogeneity of the Gly1057Asp variant's effect.\n*   **PMID: 12213887, 2002:** Investigated *IRS2* Gly1057Asp polymorphism in women with PCOS, finding that the Gly/Gly genotype was associated with higher 2-hour glucose levels, suggesting an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n*   **PMID: 11029451, 2000:** Showed a strong, obesity-dependent interaction for the Gly1057Asp variant in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in an Italian population.\n*   **PMID: 19280145, 2009:** Screened a cohort of patients with severe insulin resistance for rare *IRS2* variants and found several novel non-synonymous changes, but none showed clear co-segregation with the disease, suggesting they are not fully penetrant monogenic causes.\n*   **PMID: 29031145, 2017:** A study using rat models showed that genetic disruption of *IRS2* impaired growth but, unlike in mice, did not cause type 2 diabetes, highlighting species-specific differences in the gene's function.\n*   **PMID: 32675685, 2020:** Review discussing the role of IRS proteins in linking insulin/IGF signaling to development, fertility, and nutrient sensing, underscoring the broad biological importance of the pathway.\n*   **PMID: 32371427, 2020:** A study on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) identifying a link between the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway and AKT signaling through IRS2, suggesting a mechanism for the development of hepatic steatosis and liver cancer.\n*   **PMID: 29990886, 2018:** Gene reference into function (GeneRIF) from NCBI indicating the Gly1057Asp polymorphism is a risk factor for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-variant associations:** There are no high-confidence associations for *IRS2* variants causing a specific Mendelian disorder. Associations are primarily risk-based for complex metabolic diseases.\n    *   The **p.Gly1057Asp (rs1805097)** variant is the most studied. The Gly/Gly genotype can be considered a risk factor for **Glucose intolerance (HP:0000833)** in the context of **Polycystic ovary syndrome (HP:0000062)**. Conversely, the Asp allele in the presence of **Obesity (HP:0001513)** is a risk factor for **Type II diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978)**.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The co-occurrence of **severe Insulin resistance (HP:0000855)**, **Obesity (HP:0001513)**, and **Type II diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978)** would be the primary reason to consider *IRS2* in a research context, particularly for haplotype analysis.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of insulin resistance overlaps with numerous other genes. For monogenic forms of severe insulin resistance, differential diagnoses should include genes like *INSR* (Insulin Receptor), *AKT2*, *BSCL2*, *AGPAT2*, and *LMNA*, which are associated with various lipodystrophy and severe insulin resistance syndromes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in IRS2 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "TNXB": "TNXB Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID**: 11976.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID**: 600985.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations**:\n    *   Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic-like, type 1 (clEDS), an autosomal recessive condition, is the primary disease associated with biallelic pathogenic variants in TNXB.\n    *   TNXB haploinsufficiency has been associated with the hypermobility type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS).\n    *   Familial vesicoureteral reflux has been linked to heterozygous variants in some families, though the evidence is not yet definitive.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The association between TNXB and \"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome due to tenascin-X deficiency\" is rated as **Strong** by the Genomics England PanelApp.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients**:\n    *   **Autosomal Recessive**: Biallelic pathogenic variants result in classic-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (clEDS), which is characterized by a complete absence of the tenascin-X protein.\n    *   **Autosomal Dominant**: Heterozygous variants that lead to reduced tenascin-X levels (haploinsufficiency) are associated with a percentage of cases of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS).\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: TNXB is not highly constrained against loss-of-function variants. The gnomAD v2.1.1 scores are pLI = 0.00, pNull = 1.00, and pRec = 0.00. The LOEUF score is 1.03, which does not indicate intolerance to loss-of-function variation.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that the loss of one copy of the TNXB gene is generally tolerated in the large population sample of gnomAD. This is consistent with the primary disease, clEDS, being a recessive condition where heterozygous carriers are often mildly affected or asymptomatic.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**:\n    *   **Null variants**: Nonsense, frameshift, splice-site variants, and whole-gene deletions that lead to a complete absence of functional protein are the most common cause of autosomal recessive clEDS.\n    *   **Gene conversion events**: Recombination events with the highly homologous pseudogene, *TNXA*, are a recurrent mechanism of pathogenicity, creating chimeric genes. These events introduce deleterious sequences, such as a 120-bp deletion or the c.12174C>G (p.Cys4058Trp) missense variant, into *TNXB*.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms** (Ranked by approximate frequency for clEDS):\n    1.  Skin hyperextensibility (HP:0000974) - 100%.\n    2.  Joint hypermobility (HP:0001382) - 100%.\n    3.  Easy bruising (HP:0000978) - ~91%.\n    4.  Soft skin (HP:0000977).\n    5.

Brachydactyly (HP:0001156).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**:\n    *   Vesicoureteral reflux (HP:0000076).\n    *   Edema of the lower limbs (HP:0010741).\n    *   Mitral valve prolapse (HP:0001634).\n    *   Arrhythmia (HP:0011675).\n    *   Mild atrophic scarring (HP:0001075) - Notably, severe atrophic \"cigarette paper\" scars seen in classic EDS are absent.\n    *   Gastrointestinal dysmotility.\n    *   Proximal muscle weakness (HP:0003701).\n    *   Distal muscle weakness (HP:0009053).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: The diagnosis of clEDS is often made in adulthood. However, clinical features such as joint hypermobility and easy bruising are present from childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Severity ranges from mild joint hypermobility in some heterozygous carriers to a multi-systemic disorder in individuals with biallelic null mutations, featuring significant musculoskeletal, skin, and neurological symptoms.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**:\n    *   **Biallelic null variants**: These genotypes, resulting from nonsense, frameshift, or splice-site mutations, consistently lead to a complete lack of tenascin-X protein and the classic-like EDS phenotype.\n    *   **Homozygous 30-kb deletion**: Deletion of *CYP21A2* and *TNXB* due to unequal crossover causes congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) combined with clEDS, known as CAH-X syndrome.\n    *   **Heterozygous variants**: Haploinsufficiency of TNXB is associated with hypermobility type EDS (hEDS), often characterized by joint hypermobility, pain, and soft skin, but without the full constellation of features seen in clEDS.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: The pathogenic missense variant p.Cys4058Trp, often resulting from a gene conversion event, affects a cysteine residue predicted to be critical for a disulfide bond, thereby disrupting the protein's tertiary structure.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: To date, no specific genotype-phenotype correlations within the clEDS spectrum have been firmly established.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.11435_11524+30del (120-bp deletion) & c.12174C>G, p.(Cys4058Trp)** / ClinVar Significance: Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic-like, 1;

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type / This variant alone characterizes a distinct gene conversion event (chimera 2).\n*   **Complete or partial gene deletions** / ClinVar Significance: Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic-like, 1; Congenital adrenal hyperplasia / Large deletions often also involve the adjacent *CYP21A2* gene.\n*   **NM_001365276.2(TNXB):c.8473G>A, p.(Glu2825Lys)** / ClinVar Significance: Likely Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome due to tenascin-X deficiency.\n*   **NM_019105.8:c.5362del, p.(Thr1788Profs*100)** / ClinVar Significance: Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: classic-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome / This novel frameshift variant was shown to cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.\n*   **NM_019105.8:c.8278C>T, p.(Gln2760*)** / ClinVar Significance: Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: classic-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome / A novel nonsense variant identified in an Italian patient.\n*   **6074A > T nucleotide transition, p.(Asp2025Val)** / ClinVar Significance: Reported as Likely Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with severe joint pain, hypermobility, and muscle weakness.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues**: GTEx data shows high expression of TNXB in tissues rich in connective tissue, including adrenal gland, artery (aorta and tibial), skin, colon, lung, and adipose tissue.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**:\n    *   **Skin, Joints, Muscle**: High expression in these tissues correlates directly with the primary clEDS phenotypes of skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and myopathy.\n    *   **Adrenal Gland**: Proximity and co-deletion with the *CYP21A2* gene, which is highly expressed in the adrenal gland, explains the combined CAH-X syndrome phenotype.\n    *   **Gastrointestinal Tract**: Expression in the colon and other GI tissues may underlie symptoms like rectal prolapse and dysmotility.\n*   **Expression During Development**: Tenascin-X is involved in matrix maturation and wound healing, suggesting its expression is critical throughout life for tissue homeostasis.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: Tenascin-X is an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein that organizes and maintains the structural integrity of connective tissues by regulating the production and assembly of collagen fibrils and elastic fibers.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**:\n    *   **Loss-of-Function**: Recessive clEDS is caused by biallelic null variants leading to a complete absence of tenascin-X protein, which disrupts the structure of the ECM.\n    *   **Haploinsufficiency**: Dominant hEDS associated with TNXB is caused by heterozygous variants that reduce the amount of functional tenascin-X protein by approximately half.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**:\n    *   **ECM Organization**: The absence of tenascin-X leads to disorganized and sparse collagen fibrils and abnormal elastic fibers in the dermis, weakening connective tissue.\n    *   **TGF-\u03b2 Signaling**: The fibrinogen-related domain of tenascin-X can modulate TGF-\u03b2 signaling, which is critical for tissue fibrosis and wound healing.\n    *   **PI3K/Akt Signaling**: Tenascin-X may play a role in regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, with downstream effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield**: TNXB variants are an underdiagnosed cause of EDS-like symptoms, partly due to the technical challenges of sequencing imposed by the *TNXA* pseudogene. NGS panels that can accurately distinguish the gene from the pseudogene are required for effective screening.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing**: Testing is indicated for patients presenting with clinical features of classic or hypermobile EDS, especially when atrophic scarring is absent or when accompanied by features like significant myalgia, neuropathy, or organ prolapse. It is also indicated in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who show signs of a connective tissue disorder.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management**: Management is symptomatic and proactive, including physical therapy to strengthen muscles without overburdening joints, pain management (often avoiding opioids for chronic pain), and surveillance for cardiac, gastrointestinal, and gynecological complications.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling for clEDS involves explaining its autosomal recessive inheritance and the 25% recurrence risk for sibs. The presence of the highly homologous *TNXA* pseudogene complicates molecular diagnosis, requiring specialized laboratory techniques like long-range PCR or MLPA for accurate variant detection, especially for deletions and gene conversion events. Testing of heterozygous carriers is possible once the familial variants are known.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Schalkwijk et al., 2001 (NEJM)**: First described a recessive form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome caused by a deficiency of tenascin-X, linking the protein absence to the phenotype of hyperextensible skin and joint hypermobility without atrophic scarring.\n*   **Zweers et al., 2003 (AJHG)**: Provided the first evidence that haploinsufficiency of TNXB is associated with the hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n*   **Demirdas et al., 2017 (Clin Genet)**: A key study that delineated the clinical spectrum of TNXB-related clEDS in 17 individuals, highlighting features like easy bruising, foot anomalies, myopathy, and neuropathy, and discussing diagnostic challenges.\n*   **Malfait et al., 2017 (Am J Med Genet C)**: The 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, which formally defined \"Classical-like EDS\" (clEDS) as a distinct subtype caused by TNXB deficiency.\n*   **Green et al., 2020 (Clin Genet)**: Described the clinical and molecular characteristics of 20 patients with clEDS, reinforcing the core phenotype and noting the high frequency of gene conversion events involving the *TNXA* pseudogene.\n*   **Chen et al., 2023 (Front. Mol. Biosci.)**: A comprehensive review summarizing the roles of tenascin-X in clEDS, pain pathogenesis, tumor suppression, and fibrosis, referencing the *Tnxb-/-* mouse model.\n*   **Morissette et al., 2015 (Am J Med Genet C)**: Detailed the CAH-X syndrome, a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving *CYP21A2* and *TNXB*, linking congenital adrenal hyperplasia with EDS phenotypes.\n*   **Miki et al., 2023 (Front Genet)**: Developed and validated an NGS-based screening system to accurately detect TNXB variants, including those derived from the *TNXA* pseudogene, in a cohort of nine clEDS patients.\n*   **Ritelli et al., 2019 (Genes)**: Reported two Italian patients with clEDS due to novel compound heterozygous null variants in TNXB, highlighting that the disorder is likely underdiagnosed outside of specific populations.\n*   **Kaufman & Butler, 2016 (World J Med Genet)**: Case report of a patient with a specific *TNXB* missense mutation presenting with moderate to severe EDS symptoms, contributing to the catalogue of pathogenic variants.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**:\n    *   Biallelic null variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site, large deletions, pathogenic gene conversions) are strongly associated with the full clEDS phenotype, characterized by a triad of **Skin hyperextensibility (HP:0000974)**, **Joint hypermobility (HP:0001382)**, and **Easy bruising (HP:0000978)**.\n    *   Heterozygous null or missense variants (causing haploinsufficiency) are associated with **Joint hypermobility (HP:0001382)** as part of a diagnosis of hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags**:\n    *   The presence of classic EDS features (significant skin hyperextensibility and generalized joint hypermobility) in the **absence of atrophic, \"cigarette paper\" scarring** is a primary red flag for TNXB-related clEDS.\n    *   Co-occurrence of a hypermobility spectrum disorder with **early-onset and significant myalgia (HP:0003326)**, **muscle weakness (HP:0001324)**, or signs of **axonal polyneuropathy (HP:0003477)** should raise suspicion for *TNXB* mutations.\n    *   The combination of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) with EDS features is a strong indicator for a contiguous gene deletion involving *CYP21A2* and *TNXB*.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**:\n    *   **Classical EDS (cEDS)**: Caused by *COL5A1* or *COL5A2* variants. Overlaps in skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility, but is distinguished by the presence of prominent atrophic scarring, which is characteristically absent in clEDS.\n    *   **Hypermobile EDS (hEDS)**: The genetic basis is largely unknown, but a subset of cases have *TNXB* heterozygous variants. Distinguishing hEDS from clEDS relies on the severity of skin hyperextensibility, which is typically mild or absent in hEDS.\n    *   **Other Connective Tissue Disorders**: Conditions like Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and other rare EDS types should be considered, but can typically be differentiated by their distinct clinical features and genetic causes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in TNXB (1/1):\nN/A.

        "FLG": "FLG Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:3747.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 135940.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Ichthyosis Vulgaris (IV) and Atopic Dermatitis (AD).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Loss-of-function (LoF) variants in *FLG* are the strongest known genetic risk factor for atopic dermatitis. *FLG* mutations are a well-established cause of ichthyosis vulgaris.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Ichthyosis vulgaris is inherited in an autosomal semi-dominant pattern, where individuals with two null mutations have a more severe phenotype than those with one. Atopic dermatitis risk is also dose-dependent.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint scores for *FLG* are pLI = 0.00, LOEUF = 1.15. The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) is low.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI score indicates that the gene is tolerant to heterozygous loss-of-function variation in the general population, which is consistent with the high prevalence of heterozygous carriers. Disease is associated with biallelic LoF mutations (more severe) or heterozygous LoF mutations (milder phenotype or risk factor).\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift) are the established pathogenic class. These mutations typically lead to a truncated, non-functional profilaggrin protein.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Ichthyosis (HP:0008064).\n    *   Atopic dermatitis (HP:0000964).\n    *   Palmar hyperlinearity (HP:0001053).\n    *   Keratosis pilaris (HP:0000995).\n    *   Xerosis (HP:0000934).\n    *   Asthma (HP:0002099).\n    *   Allergic rhinitis (HP:0003192).\n    *   Food allergy (HP:0002097).\n    *   Flexural eczema (HP:0010582).\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Pityriasis alba (HP:0001056).\n    *   Pulpitis sicca (dry fingertips).\n    *   Elevated circulating IgE level (HP:0003212).\n    *   Dirty neck (hyperlinearity and hyperpigmentation of the neck).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically in early childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity is variable and correlates with the number of *FLG* null alleles; homozygous or compound heterozygous individuals have more severe ichthyosis vulgaris than heterozygotes. The presence of LoF variants is associated with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Loss-of-function (null) mutations reduce the amount of functional filaggrin protein, leading to impaired skin barrier function.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The *FLG* gene consists of a large third exon with 10-12 tandem repeats, each coding for a filaggrin monomer. Loss-of-function mutations affecting the profilaggrin protein result in an absence of functional filaggrin.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is strong; having two LoF mutations (homozygous or compound heterozygous) is highly correlated with the clinical diagnosis of ichthyosis vulgaris. Heterozygous carriers have a milder phenotype or are predisposed to atopic dermatitis.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** The common European null mutations R501X and 2282del4 are strongly associated with ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis. Children with the R501X mutation may be less responsive to therapy for atopic dermatitis.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1501C>T (p.Arg501Ter) / rs61816761 / Pathogenic:** Associated with ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis.

This tissue-specific expression directly correlates with the dermatological phenotypes seen in patients with pathogenic variants.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The primary phenotypes are cutaneous, including skin dryness (xerosis), scaling (ichthyosis), and inflammation (eczema), due to the protein's role in epidermal barrier formation.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Filaggrin is expressed in terminally differentiating keratinocytes in the outermost layers of the epidermis. The clinical presentation often begins in early childhood.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The *FLG* gene encodes profilaggrin, which is cleaved into multiple filaggrin protein monomers that are critical for bundling keratin filaments and forming the cornified cell envelope of the epidermis.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is loss-of-function, leading to filaggrin haploinsufficiency. This results in a reduced amount of functional filaggrin protein, with a gene-dosage effect observed.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Reduced filaggrin impairs keratin aggregation and the formation of the skin's barrier, leading to increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and enhanced penetration of allergens and irritants. This contributes to dry skin, ichthyosis, and atopic conditions.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Filaggrin aggregates keratin intermediate filaments, a crucial step in the terminal differentiation of epidermal cells to form a flattened, strong physical barrier.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Up to half of patients with atopic dermatitis may carry an *FLG* mutation. Testing for common mutations like R501X and 2282del4 has a high yield in European patients with ichthyosis vulgaris.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is indicated for individuals with clinical signs of ichthyosis vulgaris or moderate-to-severe, early-onset atopic dermatitis, particularly with a family history of atopy.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identifying *FLG* mutations can confirm a diagnosis, inform prognosis (e.g., risk of persistent atopic dermatitis), and guide management focused on aggressive skin barrier repair and moisturization.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the semi-dominant inheritance pattern, the variable expressivity, and the increased risk for associated atopic conditions like asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 35368383 (2024):** Identified novel and established *FLG* LoF variants in a pediatric cohort, associating them with higher transepidermal water loss and moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.\n*   **PMID: 23421459 (2013):** Confirmed associations between *FLG* null mutations and specific phenotypes including flexural eczema, xerosis, hyperlinear palms, and keratosis pilaris in a cohort with occupational eczema.\n*   **PMID: 22299762 (2012):** Identified two novel *FLG* null mutations in Chinese pedigrees with ichthyosis vulgaris, expanding the mutational spectrum.\n*   **PMID: 22154943 (2012):** A landmark review detailing filaggrin's multifunctional role in skin barrier maintenance and its association with ichthyosis vulgaris, atopic eczema, asthma, and allergies.\n*   **PMID: 22002933 (2011):** Demonstrated that intragenic copy number variation (CNV) in *FLG* contributes to atopic dermatitis risk in a dose-dependent manner, independent of null mutations.\n*   **PMID: 16444271 (2006):** A foundational study that identified loss-of-function mutations in *FLG* as the underlying cause of ichthyosis vulgaris.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function variants (e.g., R501X, 2282del4) are strongly associated with Ichthyosis (HP:0008064), Palmar hyperlinearity (HP:0001053), and Keratosis pilaris (HP:0000995).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of early-onset ichthyosis or severe atopic dermatitis with prominent palmar hyperlinearity and keratosis pilaris is highly suggestive of pathogenic variants in *FLG*.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The atopic manifestations overlap with those caused by variants in other immune-pathway genes, but the prominent ichthyosis and barrier-defect features are more specific to *FLG*.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in FLG (1/1):\nN/A.

        "ALMS1": "ALMS1 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: ALMS1**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID**: ALMS1 (HGNC:428).\n*   **OMIM Gene ID**: 606844.\n*   **Primary Disease Association**: Alstr\u00f6m syndrome (OMIM: 203800).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The gene-disease relationship for ALMS1 and Alstr\u00f6m syndrome is classified as \"Definitive\" by ClinGen and G2P.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns**: Alstr\u00f6m syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Heterozygous carriers are typically asymptomatic.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: ALMS1 is a large gene, and constraint metrics from gnomAD help interpret the impact of variants. The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score for ALMS1 is high, indicating the gene is intolerant to protein-truncating variants. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) score is low, also indicating constraint against loss-of-function variation. Specific values can be obtained from the gnomAD database.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: A high pLI score (typically \u22650.9) suggests that heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants are not tolerated and are likely to be pathogenic. For a recessive gene like ALMS1, this indicates that biallelic LoF variants are highly likely to cause disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Complete loss-of-function (cLOF) variants, such as nonsense and frameshift mutations, are the most common type of pathogenic variant in ALMS1 (accounting for about 97% of cases). These variants typically lead to nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA transcript. While rarer, some missense variants have been confirmed as pathogenic, sometimes by demonstrating an effect on splicing.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms**:\n    *   Retinal dystrophy (HP:0000556): Present in 97.8% of patients, a hallmark of the disease.\n    *   Obesity (HP:0001513): Part of a cluster of metabolic anomalies affecting 85% of patients.\n    *   Type 2 diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978): Also part of the metabolic anomaly cluster seen in 85% of patients.\n    *   Nystagmus (HP:0000639): A key feature of the vision impairment seen in 97.8% of cases.\n    *   Blindness (HP:0000618): A common progression of the retinal dystrophy.\n    *   Sensorineural hearing impairment (HP:0000407).\n    *   Dilated cardiomyopathy (HP:0001644).\n    *   Hyperinsulinemia (HP:0000842).\n    *   Acanthosis nigricans (HP:0000953).\n    *   Short stature (in adulthood) (HP:0004322).\n    *   Male hypogonadism (HP:0000022).\n    *   Hepatic dysfunction (HP:0001392).\n    *   Renal insufficiency (HP:0000083).\n    *   Hypertriglyceridemia (HP:0002155).\n    *   Alopecia (HP:0001596).\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms**:\n    *   Pulmonary fibrosis (HP:0002206).\n    *   Portal hypertension (HP:0001409).\n    *   Cirrhosis (HP:0001394).\n    *   Cor triatriatum sinister.\n    *   Urologic dysfunction.\n    *   Thickened ears.\n    *   Female hyperandrogenism.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**:\n    *   Cone-rod dystrophy typically presents in infancy with nystagmus and photophobia, leading to legal blindness in adolescence.\n    *   Obesity develops in early childhood.\n    *   Cardiomyopathy can occur in infancy (often transient but severe) or develop later in adolescence/adulthood.\n    *   The number and severity of systemic features tend to increase with age.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**:\n    *   Significant intrafamilial and interfamilial phenotypic heterogeneity is a hallmark of Alstr\u00f6m syndrome; even siblings with identical genotypes can have different clinical courses.\n    *   Patients with residual ALMS1 protein expression, potentially from variants that escape nonsense-mediated decay, may have milder phenotypes.\n    *   Atypical cases with milder retinal phenotypes have been described.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Phenotypes**: The majority of pathogenic variants are truncating, leading to the classic multisystemic disease. A missense variant (c.9542G>A) that alters splicing was associated with an atypical and milder retinal phenotype.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**:\n    *   Mutational hotspots are located in exons 8, 10, and 16, which are notable for their large size.\n    *   Variants in exon 8 are significantly associated with absent, mild, or delayed renal disease.\n    *   Variants in exon 16 have a suggestive association with retinal degeneration onset before age one, urological dysfunction, dilated cardiomyopathy, and diabetes.\n    *   Truncating variants around exon 10 are associated with a higher prevalence of liver dysfunction.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: Correlations are generally considered moderate to weak, with significant phenotypic variability remaining a major challenge.\n*   **Examples**: The c.10775delC variant is a recurrent mutation associated with a founder effect and the classic Alstr\u00f6m syndrome phenotype.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.10775delC (p.Ser3592fs)**: Pathogenic; A recurrent variant associated with classic Alstr\u00f6m syndrome features.\n*   **c.6820C>T (p.Arg2274*)**: Pathogenic; Associated with Alstr\u00f6m syndrome.\n*   **c.4414_4415delGT (p.Val1472Nfs*26)**: Pathogenic; Novel variant found in a patient with Alstr\u00f6m syndrome and cor triatriatum sinister.\n*   **c.9542G>A (p.Arg3181Gln)**: Pathogenic; A missense variant causing aberrant splicing, associated with an atypical, milder retinal phenotype.\n*   **c.286C>T (p.Gln96*)**: Pathogenic; Novel variant found in a patient with an unusually mild retinal phenotype.\n*   **c.1211C>G (p.Ser404*)**: Pathogenic; Novel de novo variant in the same patient as c.286C>T.\n*   **p.(Arg2722Ter)**: Pathogenic; Identified as the most frequent variant in a large meta-analysis, associated with classic Alstr\u00f6m syndrome.\n*   **Note**: ClinVar lists over 640 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants for Alstr\u00f6m syndrome, the majority being frameshift and nonsense mutations.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues**: ALMS1 is broadly expressed at low levels in most tissues, consistent with the multisystemic nature of the disease. GTEx data indicates the highest expression is in the testis, with moderate expression in the brain, eye, and lungs.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes**:\n    *   Expression in the retina is critical, and its disruption leads to cone-rod dystrophy.\n    *   Expression in the pancreas, heart, liver, and kidneys correlates directly with the development of diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and hepatic/renal dysfunction, respectively.\n    *   Expression in the inner ear explains the associated sensorineural hearing loss.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: ALMS1 encodes a large protein that localizes to centrosomes and the basal bodies of cilia, playing an essential role in the formation and function of primary cilia. It is involved in intracellular trafficking, cell cycle regulation, and maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The disease mechanism is a loss of function of the ALMS1 protein due to biallelic pathogenic variants. This disrupts ciliary function, leading to the classification of Alstr\u00f6m syndrome as a ciliopathy.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**: Disruption of the primary cilium impairs crucial signaling pathways in numerous tissues, explaining the pleiotropic nature of the syndrome. Pathways affected include the \"Regulation of PLK1 Activity at G2/M Transition\" and \"Centrosome maturation.\"\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions**: ALMS1 is known to interact with \u03b1-actinin and proteins involved in endosomal transport.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield**: Genetic testing for ALMS1 variants has a high diagnostic yield in patients who present with the characteristic clinical features of Alstr\u00f6m syndrome, especially early-onset retinal dystrophy combined with other systemic signs.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing**: The primary indications for testing are infantile cone-rod dystrophy (presenting as nystagmus and photophobia), early childhood obesity associated with hyperinsulinemia, and unexplained cardiomyopathy in infancy or childhood.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management**: While there is no cure, an early diagnosis is crucial for implementing a multidisciplinary management plan. This includes surveillance for and treatment of diabetes, heart failure, thyroid dysfunction, and renal and liver complications.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling should address the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, the 25% recurrence risk in siblings, and the availability of carrier testing for at-risk relatives. The high degree of clinical variability, even among family members with the same variants, is a key point to communicate.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Marshall JD et al.

PMID: 37322421**: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of 357 patients which provided updated frequencies of clinical features and strengthened the association between variants in exon 10 and liver disease.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**:\n    *   Biallelic truncating variants in *ALMS1* are strongly predictive of the classic Alstr\u00f6m syndrome constellation: Retinal dystrophy (HP:0000556), Obesity (HP:0001513), Type 2 diabetes (HP:0005978), and Dilated cardiomyopathy (HP:0001644).\n    *   Variants in exon 8 are correlated with a milder renal phenotype (HP:0000083).\n    *   Variants in exon 16 are correlated with earlier onset of multiple features, including retinal dystrophy and cardiomyopathy.\n    *   Variants in exon 10 are correlated with a higher prevalence of liver dysfunction (HP:0001392).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags**:\n    *   The combination of infantile nystagmus (HP:0000639) and progressive cone-rod dystrophy (HP:0000556) is a major red flag.\n    *   When the above vision-related phenotypes are combined with early childhood obesity (HP:0001513) and insulin resistance (HP:0000842), suspicion for Alstr\u00f6m syndrome should be very high.\n    *   Dilated cardiomyopathy (HP:0001644) presenting in infancy is a key, and sometimes initial, manifestation.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**:\n    *   **Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS)**: Shows significant overlap (retinal dystrophy, obesity, renal disease). However, polydactyly and significant cognitive impairment are characteristic of BBS and not typical of Alstr\u00f6m syndrome.\n    *   Other ciliopathies with overlapping features should be considered.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in ALMS1 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "SPTBN4": "SPTBN4 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: SPTBN4**\n\nThis dossier provides a comprehensive clinical genetics summary for the SPTBN4 gene, focusing on genotype-phenotype correlations to aid in the assessment of genetic variants.\n\n***\n\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 14896.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 606214.\n*   **Primary Disease Association:** Biallelic pathogenic variants in SPTBN4 are associated with Neurodevelopmental disorder with hypotonia, neuropathy, and deafness (NEDHND), also referred to as SPTBN4-related disorder (OMIM #617519).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between SPTBN4 and NEDHND is considered definitive, based on multiple reports of pathogenic variants in affected individuals.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The condition is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, requiring homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants. Parents are typically heterozygous carriers.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score helps to quantify a gene's intolerance to protein-truncating variants, with a score \u2265 0.9 indicating high intolerance. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is a continuous metric where lower values indicate greater intolerance to loss-of-function variation. Specific gnomAD constraint values for SPTBN4 were not available in the searched literature.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Genes with high pLI scores and low LOEUF scores are under strong negative selection against loss-of-function variants. For recessive diseases like NEDHND, constraint scores in heterozygotes (as represented in gnomAD) may not fully reflect the gene's essentiality when function is completely lost.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Loss-of-function variants, including nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site variants, are the most common pathogenic variant types. Multi-exon deletions and missense variants have also been reported as pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Congenital muscular hypotonia (HP:0008944).\n    *   Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).\n    *   Areflexia (HP:0001284).\n    *   Motor developmental delay (HP:0001270).\n    *   Absent speech (HP:0001344).\n    *   Intellectual disability, severe to profound (HP:0010864, HP:0002187).\n    *   Peripheral axonal neuropathy (HP:0003477).\n    *   Hearing impairment / Auditory neuropathy (HP:0000365, HP:0030043).\n    *   Feeding difficulties / Dysphagia (HP:0011968, HP:0002015).\n    *   Muscular atrophy (HP:0003202).\n    *   Respiratory insufficiency (HP:0002093).\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Horizontal nystagmus (HP:0000666).\n    *   Choreoathetosis (HP:0001266).\n    *   Cortical visual impairment (HP:0100704).\n    *   Joint contractures (HP:0001371).\n    *   Thin corpus callosum (HP:0002079).\n    *   Facial weakness / Myopathic facies (HP:0000324, HP:0002058).\n    *   Esotropia (HP:0000565).\n    *   Microphthalmia (HP:0000568).\n    *   High-arched palate (HP:0000218).\n    *   Broad nasal bridge (HP:0000431).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically congenital, with hypotonia and feeding difficulties often present at birth.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype is typically severe, with most individuals having profound developmental delay and lack of independent motor skills. However, a milder phenotype with preserved cognitive development has been reported in one family, indicating some variability.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Biallelic loss-of-function variants consistently lead to the core features of NEDHND.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No clear correlations between the location of the variant within the protein and specific phenotypic outcomes have been consistently established.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Currently considered weak or not well-established. One report described siblings with a homozygous splice-site variant who presented with axonal neuropathy but without intellectual disability, suggesting that some variants may lead to a less severe neurocognitive phenotype.\n*   **Examples:** A homozygous splice-site variant was associated with axonal neuropathy in the absence of intellectual disability in two siblings.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1090C>T (p.Gln364*):** Homozygous nonsense; Likely Pathogenic; Core NEDHND phenotype without hearing loss or epilepsy, but with dysmorphic features.\n*   **c.1799_1800delGC (p.Ala600Profs*90):** Homozygous frameshift; Pathogenic; Severe muscular hypotonia, dysphagia, absent speech, global developmental delay, and intellectual disability.\n*   **c.3375_3393del (p.Asp1126Thrfs*39):** Homozygous frameshift; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features including severe muscular hypotonia, dysphagia, and absent speech.\n*   **c.1247del (p.Leu417Tyrfs*5):** Homozygous frameshift; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **c.737G>C (p.Trp246Ser):** Compound heterozygous with a multi-exon deletion; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **c.1149dup (p.Asn384Glnfs*17):** Compound heterozygous; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **Multi-exon deletion (exons 6-11):** Compound heterozygous with a missense variant; Pathogenic; Core NEDHND features.\n*   **c.1597C>T (p.Arg533*):** Homozygous nonsense; Pathogenic; First described case with congenital myopathy, deafness, and neuropathy.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues and Clinical Correlation:** SPTBN4 shows high expression in various brain regions, including the cerebellum, cortex, and thalamus, as well as in the retina and spinal cord. This expression pattern is highly consistent with the observed neurological phenotypes, including developmental delay, neuropathy, and visual impairment.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The prominent expression in the central and peripheral nervous system directly relates to the core phenotypes of neuropathy, intellectual disability, and hearing loss. The role in muscle is debated, with some evidence suggesting myopathy is a primary feature while other studies indicate it is secondary to denervation.\n*   **Expression During Development:** The gene's function is critical during neurodevelopment, as evidenced by the congenital onset of symptoms.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** SPTBN4 encodes \u03b2IV-spectrin, a cytoskeletal protein that links the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton and is crucial for organizing membrane domains in neurons.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is loss-of-function. Biallelic pathogenic variants disrupt the \u03b2IV-spectrin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the proper clustering and localization of voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels at the axon initial segments and nodes of Ranvier.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of ion channel clustering impairs the initiation and propagation of action potentials, leading to axonal neuropathy. The disruption of cytoskeletal integrity likely contributes to the broader neurodevelopmental defects, hypotonia, and auditory dysfunction.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** \u03b2IV-spectrin interacts with ankyrin-G to anchor ion channels in the neuronal membrane; disruption of this interaction is a key pathological event.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The exact diagnostic yield is unknown, but SPTBN4 variants are a rare cause of congenital hypotonia and neurodevelopmental disorders. Because the phenotype overlaps with many other neuromuscular disorders, a broad genetic testing approach, such as a multi-gene panel or exome sequencing, is recommended over single-gene testing.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for SPTBN4 is indicated in individuals presenting with congenital hypotonia, areflexia, global developmental delay, and sensorineural hearing loss, particularly after more common causes like spinal muscular atrophy have been excluded.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Management is supportive and symptomatic. This includes physical and occupational therapy, nutritional support via feeding tubes, respiratory support (e.g., BiPAP), standard anti-seizure medications, and hearing aids or other support for auditory neuropathy.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling is critical for affected families. As an autosomal recessive disorder, siblings of an affected individual have a 25% chance of being affected. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and options for prenatal or preimplantation genetic testing should be discussed.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Knierim et al., 2017 (PMID: 28540413):** First report describing a homozygous nonsense mutation in SPTBN4 causing a syndrome of congenital myopathy, deafness, and neuropathy.\n*   **Wang et al., 2018 (PMID: 29861105):** Described additional patients and demonstrated that loss-of-function variants disrupt sodium channel clustering, establishing neuropathy as a key feature.\n*   **GeneReviews, 2020:** Provided a comprehensive clinical overview of SPTBN4 disorder, summarizing the phenotype, diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling considerations.\n*   **Buelow et al., 2021 (PMID: 33772159):** Expanded the genetic and phenotypic spectrum with five new patients from four families, reporting novel variants and highlighting clinical similarities to non-5q SMA and congenital myopathies.\n*   **Gunay et al., 2023 (DOI: 10.54029/2023unk):** Reported a new homozygous nonsense variant and expanded the phenotype to include previously unreported dysmorphic features, reinforcing the core clinical features.\n*   **Al-Sagr et al., 2024 (Rare):** Described a novel homozygous frameshift variant in three siblings, helping to establish the core symptoms associated with SPTBN4 mutations.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Biallelic loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site, and large deletions) are strongly associated with the NEDHND phenotype, characterized by congenital muscular hypotonia (HP:0008944), global developmental delay (HP:0001263), areflexia (HP:0001284), and auditory neuropathy (HP:0030043).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The combination of severe, congenital hypotonia (\"floppy baby\"), areflexia/neuropathy, and hearing impairment is highly suggestive of an SPTBN4-related disorder. Testing should be considered in patients with a non-5q spinal muscular atrophy-like phenotype.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The clinical presentation overlaps with other congenital myopathies, congenital muscular dystrophies, and other genetic causes of severe neonatal hypotonia and neuropathy. Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a key differential diagnosis to exclude.\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in SPTBN4 (1/1):\nN/A.

This is consistent with the established dominant-negative disease mechanism, where a mutant protein disrupts function, rather than a loss of protein from one allele (haploinsufficiency).\n*   Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic: Missense variants and in-frame deletions that disrupt the keratin filament structure.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**:\n    *   Focal palmoplantar keratoderma (HP:0001056).\n    *   Plantar hyperkeratosis (HP:0007525).\n    *   Painful plantar callosities.\n    *   Palmoplantar blistering.\n    *   Palmoplantar pain.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**:\n    *   Nail dystrophy (HP:0008395) (typically minor or absent).\n    *   Toenail thickening (Onychauxis, HP:0001847).\n    *   Fingernail thickening (Onychauxis, HP:0001847).\n*   Age of Onset: The condition typically becomes apparent within the first few months of life.\n*   Phenotype Severity Spectrum: Phenotypes are generally considered a milder form within the pachyonychia congenita (PC) spectrum, primarily affecting the feet. Nail involvement is significantly less common (3-19%) compared to PC caused by other keratin genes like *KRT6A* (96-97%).\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   Variant Classes and Phenotypes: Heterozygous in-frame deletions and missense mutations result in a consistent phenotype of focal palmoplantar keratoderma, mainly affecting the plantar surfaces.\n*   Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype: Mutations largely cluster in the 1A and 2B domains of the keratin protein rod, which are critical for filament formation and assembly.\n*   Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength: There is a strong correlation between pathogenic variants in *KRT6C* and the development of focal plantar keratoderma, often without significant nail dystrophy.\n*   Examples:\n    *   p.Asn172del (c.516_518delCAA) is associated with familial focal PPK with minor or absent nail changes.\n    *   p.Glu472Lys (c.1414G>A) is associated with focal plantar keratoderma with normal palms and nails.\n    *   p.Ile462_Glu470del (c.1384_1410del27) is associated with familial focal PPK.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   c.516_518delCAA (p.Asn172del) / Pathogenic / Focal palmoplantar keratoderma (HP:0001056) / The deletion was found in 3 of 335 controls.\n*   c.1414G>A (p.Glu472Lys) / Pathogenic / Focal plantar keratoderma (HP:0007525) / AF not reported.\n*   c.1384_1410del27 (p.Ile462_Glu470del) / Pathogenic / Focal palmoplantar keratoderma (HP:0001056) / AF not reported.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   Highest Expressing Tissues: *KRT6C* is expressed in the plantar epidermis. GTEx data also shows expression in the esophagus mucosa, vagina, and tongue.\n*   Tissue-Specific Phenotypes: Expression in the plantar epidermis correlates directly with the primary phenotype of focal plantar keratoderma.\n*   Expression During Development: *KRT6C* is expressed in human fetal tissues between 10 and 20 weeks of gestation.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   Normal Gene Function: The *KRT6C* gene provides instructions for making keratin 6c, a protein that forms intermediate filaments to provide structural integrity and resilience to epithelial cells, particularly in the skin.\n*   Disease Mechanism: Dominant-negative. Mutant K6c protein alters the structure of the keratin intermediate filament network, making skin cells fragile and easily damaged by friction or minor trauma.\n*   Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted: The primary disruption is to the intermediate filament cytoskeleton organization. This leads to fragile skin cells that may abnormally increase keratin production in response to damage, worsening the keratoderma.\n*   Protein-Protein Interactions: K6c forms heterodimers with type I keratins, such as KRT16, to assemble into filaments. It has also been identified as a heterodimer partner for KRT9.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   Diagnostic Yield: In families presenting with familial focal PPK where other common keratin genes have been excluded, mutational analysis of *KRT6C* has a high diagnostic yield.\n*   Most Common Reasons for Testing: Patients with focal palmoplantar keratoderma, particularly with minimal or no nail involvement, who have a family history of the condition.\n*   Clinical Actionability: Diagnosis confirms the genetic basis of the keratoderma, allowing for targeted symptom management (e.g., pain relief, callus trimming) and accurate genetic counseling.\n*   Genetic Counseling Considerations: An autosomal dominant inheritance pattern means a 50% risk of transmission to offspring. The phenotype is generally limited to focal PPK, distinguishing it from more severe forms of pachyonychia congenita.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Wilson NJ, et al. J Hum Genet. 2010. (PMID: 19609311)**: First identified that mutations in *KRT6C* cause focal palmoplantar keratoderma, establishing it as a distinct genetic entity.\n*   **Wilson NJ, et al.

(PMID: 19890349)**: Reported that heterozygous in-frame deletions in *KRT6C* (p.Asn172del and p.Ile462-Glu470del) cause familial focal PPK with minor/absent nail changes.\n*   **McLean WH, et al. J Invest Dermatol. 2011. (PMID: 21346777)**: Formally included *KRT6C* mutations as a cause of pachyonychia congenita (PC-K6c), clarifying its place in the disease spectrum.\n*   **Kubo A, et al.

J Invest Dermatol. 2020. (PMID: 32067989)**: In a large registry study, confirmed that *KRT6C* mutations are associated with the least nail involvement among all PC-related keratin genes.\n*   **Chen X, et al. J Dermatol Sci. 2022. (PMID: 35948386)**: Identified KRT6C as a heterodimer partner for KRT9, providing new insight into keratin networks in palmoplantar skin.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**:\n    *   Heterozygous missense variants and in-frame deletions in *KRT6C* are strongly associated with Focal palmoplantar keratoderma (HP:0001056).\n*   **Phenotype red flags**:\n    *   Focal, painful calluses on the soles of the feet (Plantar hyperkeratosis, HP:0007525) appearing in early life.\n    *   A diagnosis of pachyonychia congenita but with absent or very mild nail dystrophy (HP:0008395).\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**:\n    *   **KRT16:** Also causes focal non-epidermolytic PPK, but may have more significant nail involvement.\n    *   **KRT6A:** Associated with more extensive disease, including significant nail dystrophy and oral leukokeratosis (HP:0000193).\n    *   **KRT17:** Associated with cutaneous cysts, follicular hyperkeratosis (HP:0100742), and natal teeth (HP:0000695).\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in KRT6C (1/1):\nN/A.

        "PIGG": "PIGG Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **PIGG Gene Dossier**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 25985.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 616918.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** PIGG-related disorder, also known as Intellectual disability, autosomal recessive 53 (MRT53), is a type of congenital disorder of glycosylation (PIGG-CDG) and is classified as an inherited GPI deficiency (IGD). It is also referred to as Early-onset epilepsy-intellectual disability-brain anomalies syndrome.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between PIGG and autosomal recessive intellectual disability is considered \"Definitive\" by Ambry Genetics and \"Strong\" by Labcorp Genetics.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** The inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. Parents with heterozygous variants are typically asymptomatic carriers.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Based on gnomAD v2.1.1 data, PIGG has a pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) of 1.00, a pRec (probability of being recessive) of 0, and a pNull (probability of being tolerant to LoF) of 0. The LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction) score is a newer metric, and a low value indicates intolerance; for PIGG, a specific LOEUF score from the most recent gnomAD version should be consulted for interpretation, with a threshold of < 0.6 in gnomAD v4.0 suggesting intolerance.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The high pLI score (\u22650.9) indicates that PIGG is extremely intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variants and is likely associated with a dominant disorder or haploinsufficiency. However, the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. This suggests strong selective pressure against heterozygous LoF variants, even though they do not cause the full syndromic phenotype.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Loss-of-function variants, including nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations, are known to be pathogenic. Missense variants have also been identified as pathogenic.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001249 - Intellectual disability.\n    *   HP:0001250 - Seizures.\n    *   HP:0001319 - Neonatal hypotonia.\n    *   HP:0001263 - Global developmental delay.\n    *   HP:0001270 - Motor delay.\n    *   HP:0002011 - Feeding difficulties.\n    *   HP:0002376 - Developmental regression.\n    *   HP:0001508 - Failure to thrive.\n    *   HP:0000252 - Microcephaly.\n    *   HP:0001344 - Absent speech.\n    *   HP:0001347 - Hyporeflexia.\n    *   HP:0001268 - Cerebellar atrophy.\n    *   HP:0000729 - Autistic behavior.\n    *   HP:0000486 - Strabismus.\n    *   HP:0000545 - Myopia.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001634 - Atrial septal defect.\n    *   HP:0004322 - Short stature.\n    *   HP:0000407 - Sensorineural hearing impairment.\n    *   HP:0001288 - Gait instability.\n    *   HP:0002123 - Spasticity.\n    *   HP:0003453 - Mitochondrial dysfunction.\n    *   HP:0000218 - High palate.\n    *   HP:0000347 - Micrognathia.\n    *   HP:0100543 - Bitemporal narrowing.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Symptoms typically begin in infancy or are early-onset.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity varies. Individuals with null or severely decreased PIGG activity present with severe phenotypes including intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, and cerebellar atrophy. Those with mildly decreased activity may present with a less severe phenotype, such as autism spectrum disorder.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Biallelic null variants (e.g., frameshift, nonsense, splice-site) or those causing severely decreased enzyme activity are associated with a classic, severe phenotype of intellectual disability, developmental delay, hypotonia, seizures, and cerebellar atrophy. Variants leading to mildly decreased PIGG activity are correlated with autism spectrum disorder.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Specific correlations to protein domains are not yet well-established in the literature.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between the residual function of PIGG variants and clinical severity is considered strong. Null or severely hypomorphic variants consistently lead to severe neurological phenotypes.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   Homozygous c.928C>T (p.Gln310*) and c.2261+1G>C variants are associated with severe intellectual disability, hypotonia, and early-onset seizures.\n    *   Compound heterozygous c.2005C>T (p.Arg669Cys) and a large deletion are also linked to the severe phenotype.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.2624_2625del (p.Leu875Ter):**\n    *   **rsID:** rs771819481\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_017733.4:c.2624_2625del\n    *   **ClinVar Significance:** Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic.\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Intellectual disability, seizures, hypotonia.\n    *   **Allele Frequency (gnomAD):** 0.009% (Exomes).\n*   **c.928C>T (p.Gln310*):**\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_017733.4:c.928C>T\n    *   **ClinVar Significance:** Pathogenic.\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Intellectual disability, hypotonia, early-onset seizures.\n    *   **Allele Frequency (gnomAD):** Not reported in gnomAD.\n*   **c.2261+1G>C:**\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_017733.4:c.2261+1G>C\n    *   **ClinVar Significance:** Pathogenic.\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Intellectual disability, hypotonia, early-onset seizures.\n    *   **Allele Frequency (gnomAD):** Not reported in gnomAD.\n*   **c.2005C>T (p.Arg669Cys):**\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_017733.4:c.2005C>T\n    *   **ClinVar Significance:** Pathogenic.\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Intellectual disability, hypotonia, early-onset seizures.\n    *   **Allele Frequency (gnomAD):** Not reported in gnomAD.\n*   **c.2600_2601delTA (p.Leu867*):**\n    *   **rsID:** Not available\n    *   **HGVS:** NM_017733.3:c.2600_2601delTA\n    *   **ClinVar Significance:** Pathogenic.\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Autosomal recessive syndromic intellectual disability, Emm-Null Phenotype.\n    *   **Allele Frequency (gnomAD):** Not available for this specific representation.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** The GTEx portal shows broad expression across many tissues. Specific high-expressing tissues should be reviewed directly from the GTEx portal for the most current data. The brain is a clinically relevant site of expression, aligning with the neurological phenotypes observed.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given the critical role of GPI-anchored proteins in neurogenesis, the prominent phenotypes are neurological. Expression analysis across various tissues can provide insights into the multisystemic nature of the disorder.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** GPI-anchored proteins are crucial for development, particularly neurogenesis, which explains the early onset of symptoms.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** PIGG encodes an ethanolamine phosphate transferase that adds an ethanolamine phosphate group to the second mannose of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor during its biosynthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is loss-of-function, leading to hypomorphic mutations. This results in a reduction of functional GPI-anchored proteins on the cell surface.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the GPI-anchor biosynthesis pathway leads to decreased or dysfunctional GPI-anchored proteins, which are vital for cell-cell adhesion, signal transduction, and neurogenesis. This deficiency underlies the severe neurological manifestations like intellectual disability, seizures, and hypotonia.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** PIGG interacts with PIGF, which stabilizes it, and competes with PIGO for binding to PIGF. These interactions are critical for the proper function of the GPI biosynthesis pathway.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Whole-genome sequencing has shown an improved diagnostic yield for PIGG-related disorders compared to targeted gene panels. It is a known cause of inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs), a group of disorders characterized by intellectual disability and seizures.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for PIGG is indicated in individuals presenting with a combination of early-onset seizures, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and hypotonia.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no specific treatments for PIGG-CDG. Management is symptomatic and supportive. Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) has been explored as a potential treatment for seizures in some GPI-deficient patients.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** PIGG-related disorder is an autosomal recessive condition. Counseling should focus on the 25% recurrence risk for future pregnancies of carrier parents and the availability of prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing. Asymptomatic carrier status of parents should be confirmed.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Tremblay-Lagani\u00e8re C, et al. (2021) PMID: 34113002:** Described 22 individuals from 19 families, expanding the phenotypic spectrum and correlating variant severity with clinical outcomes (severe vs. mild phenotypes like ASD). Established an in vitro system to assess variant pathogenicity.\n*   **Makrythanasis P, et al.

(2019) PMID: 31828834:** Identified a novel point mutation in an Iranian family with non-syndromic intellectual disability, expanding the mutational spectrum.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Biallelic loss-of-function or severe missense variants in PIGG are strongly associated with a core phenotype of global developmental delay (HP:0001263), infantile-onset seizures (HP:0001250), neonatal hypotonia (HP:0001319), and severe intellectual disability (HP:0001249).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of early-onset, often intractable seizures, severe developmental delay/intellectual disability, hypotonia, and cerebellar atrophy are highly suggestive of a PIGG-related disorder.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of PIGG-related disorder overlaps significantly with other inherited GPI deficiencies (IGDs) caused by mutations in genes like PIGA, PIGL, PIGM, PIGO, PIGV, PGAP2, and PGAP3. It should also be considered in the differential for congenital disorders of glycosylation and other syndromic forms of epilepsy and intellectual disability.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PIGG (1/1):\nN/A.

The probability of being LoF intolerant (pLI) is 0.00, and the loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is 1.13. The probability of being a recessive gene (pRec) is 0.69.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that ST14 is tolerant to heterozygous loss-of-function, which is consistent with its autosomal recessive disease mechanism. The high pRec score further supports a recessive mode of inheritance.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) loss-of-function variants, including nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site mutations, are expected to be pathogenic.

A homozygous missense variant c.1315G>A (p.Gly439Ser) was also shown to cause the ARIH syndrome.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1243C>T (p.Gln415Ter):**\n    *   Significance: Pathogenic.\n    *   Reported Phenotypes: Ichthyosis, Hypotrichosis.\n    *   Allele Frequency: Not reported in gnomAD.\n*   **c.1444G>A (p.Asp482Asn):**\n    *   Significance: Pathogenic.\n    *   Reported Phenotypes: Ichthyosis-hypotrichosis syndrome (IHS), including ichthyosis, hypotrichosis, hypohidrosis, and follicular atrophoderma.\n    *   Allele Frequency: Not reported in gnomAD.\n*   **c.1315G>A (p.Gly439Ser):**\n    *   Significance: Likely Pathogenic.\n    *   Reported Phenotypes: Autosomal recessive ichthyosis with hypotrichosis (ARIH), diffuse congenital ichthyosis, generalized non-scarring hypotrichosis.\n    *   Allele Frequency: Not reported in gnomAD.\n*   **rs704624:**\n    *   Significance: Association with breast cancer survival.\n    *   Reported Phenotypes: The minor allele is associated with lower ST14 gene expression and poorer breast cancer survival.\n    *   Allele Frequency: Varies by population.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** ST14 is highly expressed in epithelial tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract (colon, esophagus, small intestine), skin, lung, and prostate.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the skin is consistent with the cutaneous phenotype of ichthyosis and hair abnormalities (hypotrichosis). Its role in keratinocyte differentiation directly explains the skin barrier defects seen in patients.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Matriptase (ST14) is critical for terminal differentiation of the epidermis and hair follicle growth.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** ST14 encodes matriptase, a type II transmembrane serine protease that plays a critical role in epithelial barrier function and homeostasis.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Loss-of-function. Biallelic inactivating mutations in ST14 lead to a loss of matriptase proteolytic activity, causing the disease phenotype.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Loss of matriptase function impairs the activation of prostasin (PRSS8) and the processing of profilaggrin (FLG) into filaggrin monomers, which is essential for proper keratinocyte differentiation, cornified envelope formation, and skin barrier integrity.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Matriptase forms a complex with its cognate inhibitor, hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1), to regulate its activity.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** Targeted next-generation sequencing panels for ichthyosis that include ST14 are effective in identifying the genetic cause of disease in patients with compatible phenotypes.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** This gene is tested in patients presenting with congenital ichthyosis, particularly when accompanied by hypotrichosis.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Diagnosis allows for informed prognosis and management, which is primarily symptomatic and involves dermatological care with emollients and keratolytics. Ocular and dental examinations may be warranted based on reported findings.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling for autosomal recessive inheritance is indicated, including discussion of a 25% recurrence risk for future pregnancies of carrier parents and the potential for carrier testing of at-risk family members.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 29611532 (2017):** Reported a novel homozygous p.Asp482Asn mutation, expanding the mutational spectrum of IHS and further characterizing the phenotype, including histological and ultrastructural skin and hair analysis.\n*   **PMID: 30982314 (2019):** Identified a novel nonsense variant (p.Gln415Ter) in an Iranian family, adding to the spectrum of mutations causing ichthyosis and hypotrichosis and emphasizing the need for further studies.\n*   **PMID: 18843291 (2009):** Showed that ST14 mutations causing ichthyosis, follicular atrophoderma, and hypotrichosis are associated with impaired profilaggrin processing.\n*   **PMID: 18445049 (2008):** Further delineated the phenotype of Autosomal Recessive Ichthyosis with Hypotrichosis (ARIH) syndrome, describing features including congenital ichthyosis, abnormal hair, and corneal involvement.\n*   **PMID: 21199793 (2011):** A study linking the ST14 variant rs704624 to decreased matriptase protein expression and poor breast cancer survival, highlighting a role for the gene outside of Mendelian skin disease.\n*   **PMID: 31349884 (2019):** A report of a large Pakistani family with a novel homozygous missense variant (p.Gly439Ser) that confirmed linkage to the ST14 locus and segregated with the ARIH phenotype.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Biallelic loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, essential splice site) or functionally significant missense variants in ST14 are strongly associated with a phenotype combining Congenital Ichthyosis (HP:0000962) and Hypotrichosis (HP:0001006).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The combination of congenital ichthyosis with prominent hypotrichosis and follicular atrophoderma is highly suggestive of pathogenic variants in ST14.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype overlaps with other forms of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). However, the prominent and persistent hypotrichosis is a key distinguishing feature of ST14-related disease. Other disorders in the differential include Netherton syndrome (SPINK5) and IFAP syndrome (MBTPS2).\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in ST14 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "MUC5B": "MUC5B Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** MUC5B (HGNC:7516)\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 600770\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** A common promoter variant (rs35705950) is a major genetic risk factor for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) and Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis. Biallelic loss-of-function variants are associated with a hereditary mucin deficiency causing airway disease.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** High evidence for association with familial pulmonary fibrosis.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The risk allele for IPF susceptibility is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Hereditary mucin deficiency due to biallelic loss of function follows an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics for MUC5B are pLI = 0.00, LOEUF = 1.07. The pLI score suggests MUC5B is tolerant to loss-of-function variation.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that heterozygous loss-of-function variants are generally tolerated in the population. This is consistent with the recessive inheritance pattern of MUC5B-related airway disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For IPF, a specific gain-of-function promoter variant (rs35705950) is the primary risk factor. For hereditary mucin deficiency, homozygous or compound heterozygous loss-of-function variants (e.g., frameshift, nonsense, splicing) are causative.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0031950 - Usual interstitial pneumonia\n    *   HP:0002205 - Recurrent respiratory infections\n    *   HP:0002098 - Interstitial pulmonary abnormality\n    *   HP:0006512 - Bronchiectasis\n    *   HP:0002109 - Chronic rhinosinusitis\n    *   HP:0000458 - Nasal polyposis\n    *   HP:0001250 - Seizures (Note: This term's association is less direct and may require further validation)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0002879 - Chronic bronchitis\n    *   HP:0010328 - Chronic cough\n    *   HP:0030829 - Decreased forced vital capacity\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis typically has an adult onset. The congenital absence of MUC5B protein presents with symptoms from birth or early childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of IPF can range from slowly progressive to rapidly fatal. In hereditary mucin deficiency, phenotypes are variable, with some individuals having repeated infections and significant lung function impairment.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Promoter variant (rs35705950):** The 'T' allele is a gain-of-function variant that leads to overexpression of MUC5B in the distal airways. This is strongly associated with an increased risk for developing idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other interstitial lung diseases. Carriers of the 'T' allele may also have a worse disease course in hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\n    *   **Biallelic loss-of-function variants:** Homozygous or compound heterozygous null variants result in the absence of MUC5B protein. This leads to a distinct phenotype of impaired mucociliary clearance, recurrent bacterial infections, bronchiectasis, and sinus disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Most pathogenic variants are outside of specific protein domains, either in the promoter region or leading to a loss of the entire protein.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between the rs35705950 promoter variant and susceptibility to IPF is strong and highly replicated across multiple studies. The link between biallelic loss-of-function variants and congenital mucin deficiency is also strong, though based on a smaller number of reported cases.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **rs35705950 (c.-3133G>T):** / HGVS: n.-661G>T / ClinVar Significance: Risk factor / Reported Phenotypes: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (HP:0031950), Interstitial lung disease (HP:0002098) / AF (gnomAD): Highest in Ashkenazi Jewish (16.2%)\n*   **c.1938+1G>A:** / HGVS: NM_002458.2:c.1938+1G>A / ClinVar Significance: Pathogenic / Reported Phenotypes: Bronchiectasis (HP:0006512), Recurrent Staphylococcus aureus infections, Sinus disease with nasal polyps (HP:0000458) / AF: Not reported in gnomAD, novel family variant.\n*   **c.14936T>C (p.Ile4979Thr), rs201287218:** / HGVS: p.Ile4979Thr / ClinVar Significance: Uncertain significance / Reported Phenotypes: Severe respiratory disease from birth / AF (gnomAD): 0.00003\n*   **c.16738G>A (p.Gly5580Arg), rs776709402:** / HGVS: p.Gly5580Arg / ClinVar Significance: Uncertain significance / Reported Phenotypes: Severe respiratory disease from birth / AF (gnomAD): 0.000008\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** Highest expression is in the minor salivary gland, endocervix, and lung.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the lung is consistent with the primary phenotypes of pulmonary fibrosis and airway disease. Expression in salivary glands relates to its role in the properties of saliva.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The rs35705950 promoter variant leads to aberrant MUC5B expression in the distal airway epithelium of adults, contributing to the age-related onset of IPF.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** MUC5B is a major gel-forming mucin essential for maintaining the protective mucus barrier and enabling mucociliary clearance in airways and other mucosal surfaces.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:**\n    *   **Gain-of-function:** The rs35705950 promoter variant causes MUC5B overexpression in small airways, leading to impaired mucociliary clearance, epithelial injury, and a pro-fibrotic environment, which predisposes individuals to IPF.\n    *   **Loss-of-function:** Biallelic null mutations cause a complete absence of MUC5B, leading to defective mucus properties, impaired clearance of pathogens, and chronic airway inflammation and infection.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Dysregulation of MUC5B disrupts mucociliary clearance, a key innate defense mechanism. This failure of clearance is a central pathogenic event leading to either progressive fibrosis (in the case of overexpression) or chronic infection and inflammation (in the case of absence).\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** MUC5B interacts with other mucins, such as MUC5AC, and its proper glycosylation and polymerization are critical for function. Alterations in these processes are seen in various lung diseases.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Genotyping the MUC5B promoter variant (rs35705950) is relevant for assessing risk in patients with suspected or familial interstitial lung disease. Sequencing of the MUC5B gene can identify rare biallelic mutations in patients with unexplained bronchiectasis and chronic sinopulmonary infections resembling cystic fibrosis.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is performed for risk stratification in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and for differential diagnosis in patients with unexplained chronic airway disease.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** The presence of the rs35705950 'T' allele is associated with an increased risk of IPF and may influence disease progression and response to therapy. Identifying a congenital MUC5B deficiency can provide a definitive diagnosis for a complex respiratory phenotype, guiding management of infections and airway clearance.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For the rs35705950 variant, counseling should focus on the concept of genetic risk, incomplete penetrance, and the interplay with environmental factors. For biallelic loss-of-function variants, counseling for an autosomal recessive condition is indicated, including discussing risks to siblings and offspring.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 21506741 (2011):** This landmark study first identified the common MUC5B promoter polymorphism (rs35705950) and established it as the strongest genetic risk factor for familial interstitial pneumonia and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n*   **PMID: 33503378 (2021):** Reported the first cases of a congenital MUC5B deficiency due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations, defining a new recessive genetic airway disease characterized by bronchiectasis and chronic infections.\n*   **PMID: 38924494 (2024):** A recent letter highlighting that the MUC5B IPF risk variant promotes a mucosecretory phenotype and a loss of small airway secretory cells.\n*   **PMID: 35078065 (2022):** A study in a Greek cohort that explored the phenotypic characteristics driven by the MUC5B rs35705950 risk allele, both alone and in combination with other monogenic causes of iIPF.\n*   **PMID: 36517178 (2022):** This study investigated how MUC5B genotype influences radiological patterns of IPF at diagnosis and over time in patients receiving antifibrotic therapy.\n*   **PMID: 32607873 (2020):** A study showing the MUC5B promoter variant is associated with specific fibrotic subtypes of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), suggesting a role in the early origins of pulmonary fibrosis.\n*   **PMID: 37388701 (2023):** Research indicating that the 'T' allele of rs35705950 in patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis is associated with lower baseline forced vital capacity and a greater subsequent decline.\n*   **PMID: 33792558 (2021):** Showed that variability in MUC5B expression in IPF depends on both the rs35705950 genotype and the molecular endotype of the disease (cilium vs. non-cilium).\n*   **PMID: 33690187 (2021):** Utilized co-localization of gene expression and DNA methylation with GWAS data to provide further functional evidence for the roles of MUC5B and DSP in IPF etiology.\n*   **PMID: 31221532 (2020):** An analysis that compared effect sizes of different classes of variants implicated in IPF, including the MUC5B GWAS locus.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   **rs35705950 'T' allele:** Strongly associated with susceptibility to Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (HP:0031950) and Interstitial lung disease (HP:0002098).\n    *   **Biallelic loss-of-function variants (e.g., c.1938+1G>A):** Causative for a syndrome encompassing Bronchiectasis (HP:0006512), Recurrent respiratory infections (HP:0002205), and Nasal polyposis (HP:0000458).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:**\n    *   The presence of Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (HP:0031950) on imaging in an adult patient strongly suggests investigating the MUC5B promoter variant status.\n    *   A clinical picture of unexplained, early-onset bronchiectasis with chronic sinopulmonary infections, particularly if cystic fibrosis has been ruled out, should prompt consideration of sequencing MUC5B for biallelic loss-of-function mutations.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:**\n    *   The phenotype of MUC5B-related IPF overlaps with interstitial lung disease caused by mutations in other genes, such as those related to telomere maintenance (TERT, TERC) and surfactant proteins (SFTPA1, SFTPC, ABCA3).\n    *   The phenotype of congenital MUC5B deficiency overlaps clinically with cystic fibrosis (CFTR) and primary ciliary dyskinesia (multiple genes), but is distinguished by normal CFTR function and ciliary ultrastructure/function.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in MUC5B (2/2):\nN/A.

        "SPEN": "SPEN Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: SPEN**\n\n#### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 17575\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 613484\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** SPEN haploinsufficiency causes a neurodevelopmental disorder, referred to as Radio-Tartaglia Syndrome (RATARS), which overlaps with proximal 1p36 deletion syndrome. The gene is also implicated in Neurodevelopmental delay-congenital heart defects-intellectual disability syndrome.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for SPEN's role in neurodevelopmental disorders is strong, supported by the identification of de novo likely gene-disrupting variants in affected individuals. Haploinsufficiency of SPEN is considered a major contributor to the phenotype.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with many cases arising from de novo variants.\n\n#### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** SPEN is extremely intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation with a pLI score of 1.00 and a LOEUF score of 0.09 (90% CI 0.05-0.15).\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A pLI score \u2265 0.9 and a low LOEUF score indicate that the gene is under strong selective pressure against protein-truncating variants. This strongly suggests that haploinsufficiency is a mechanism of disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Protein-truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift) distributed throughout the gene are established as pathogenic. De novo likely gene-disrupting and missense variants have also been identified in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\n#### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Global developmental delay (HP:0001263)\n    *   Intellectual disability (mild to severe) (HP:0001249)\n    *   Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0000717)\n    *   Hypotonia (HP:0001252)\n    *   Abnormal speech pattern / Absent speech (HP:0002166, HP:0001344)\n    *   Congenital heart defects (e.g., Atrial septal defect, Patent ductus arteriosus) (HP:0001627)\n    *   Feeding difficulties (HP:0011968)\n    *   Behavioral abnormalities (e.g., anxiety, aggression) (HP:0000718)\n    *   Facial dysmorphism (e.g., high/narrow palate, deep-set eyes) (HP:0001999)\n    *   Obesity / Increased BMI (HP:0001513)\n    *   Agenesis of corpus callosum (HP:0001277)\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250)\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms:**\n    *   Scoliosis / Kyphosis (HP:0002650, HP:0002808)\n    *   Brain and spine anomalies (e.g., Chiari malformation type I) (HP:0002313)\n    *   Cryptorchidism (HP:0000028)\n    *   Strabismus (HP:0000486)\n    *   Hearing impairment (HP:0000365)\n    *   Joint hypermobility (HP:0001382)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically in the prenatal to infantile period, with developmental delays noted in early childhood. Obesity or an elevated BMI may become more apparent after the age of four.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The clinical presentation ranges from mild to severe, but there are no clear genotype-phenotype correlations to predict severity.\n\n#### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Truncating variants throughout the gene consistently lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder with features including developmental delay, intellectual disability, and behavioral issues.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Currently, no significant genotype-phenotype correlations have been identified based on the location of the variant or the protein domain affected. Even truncating variants at the C-terminus, which spare the RRM domains but affect the SPOC domain, do not result in a less severe phenotype.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Weak; there are no obvious genotype-phenotype correlations, suggesting a homogeneous effect of loss-of-function variants.\n\n#### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   The following is a representative list of pathogenic variants. Allele frequencies in gnomAD are typically zero or near-zero for pathogenic variants.\n*   **c.162dup (p.Glu55Argfs*3):** Pathogenic / Neurodevelopmental disorder.\n*   **c.456dup (p.Ala153Cysfs*27):** Pathogenic / Classical phenotype with distal weakness and sensory impairment.\n*   **c.922G>T (p.Glu308*):** Pathogenic / Classical phenotype with distal weakness and sensory impairment.\n*   **c.2053C>T (p.Arg685*):** Pathogenic / Neurodevelopmental disorder.\n*   **c.3109C>T (p.Arg1037*):** Likely Pathogenic / Neurodevelopmental disorder.\n*   **c.4837C>T (p.Arg1613*):** Pathogenic / Neurodevelopmental disorder.\n*   **c.5569_5570del (p.Ser1857Glyfs*3):** Pathogenic / Neurodevelopmental disorder.\n*   **c.6385_6388del (p.Ser2129fs):** Pathogenic / Neurodevelopmental disorder.\n*   **c.7255C>T (p.Arg2419*):** Pathogenic / Neurodevelopmental disorder.\n*   **c.8200_8201del (p.Glu2734fs):** Pathogenic / Neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\n#### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** SPEN shows broad expression, with the highest levels in the pituitary, adrenal gland, and thyroid. It also shows notable expression in various brain regions, including the cortex and cerebellum.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the developing and postnatal brain is consistent with the observed neurodevelopmental phenotype, including intellectual disability, autism, and brain anomalies.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** SPEN is required for multiple developmental processes, including neuronal cell development. Its expression pattern during human neocortical development supports its critical role in brain formation.\n\n#### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** SPEN encodes a large nuclear protein that acts as a transcriptional repressor, playing a key role in several signaling pathways.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Haploinsufficiency is the established disease mechanism, where the loss of one functional copy of the gene leads to a clinical phenotype. This is supported by the high constraint against LoF variants and the similar phenotype seen in individuals with deletions involving the gene.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Notch Signaling:** SPEN is a repressor in the Notch signaling pathway, which is critical for embryonic development, neurogenesis, and cell fate decisions.\n    *   **X-Chromosome Inactivation (XCI):** SPEN is essential for the coating of the inactive X chromosome by Xist RNA, a key step in XCI. This is linked to the finding of a specific X-chromosome DNA methylation \"episignature\" in affected females.\n    *   **Wnt Signaling & Other Pathways:** SPEN has also been implicated as a regulator in Wnt signaling, nuclear receptor signaling, and DNA damage response pathways. Disruption of these fundamental pathways likely contributes to the broad developmental abnormalities seen in patients.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The C-terminal SPOC domain interacts with corepressors like SMRT and NCoR and recruits histone deacetylase complexes (e.g., NuRD), which is essential for its transcriptional repression function. The N-terminal RRM domains suggest a role in RNA binding and processing.\n\n#### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** SPEN variants are identified in individuals undergoing testing for neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those with features overlapping 1p36 deletion syndrome. It is considered a significant gene in cohorts of unsolved neurodevelopmental disorders.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is indicated for individuals with unexplained global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, hypotonia, and congenital anomalies, especially heart defects and brain malformations.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Diagnosis allows for anticipatory guidance and surveillance for known associated features, such as obesity, behavioral issues, and congenital heart defects. Management is supportive and tailored to the individual's specific symptoms.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, the high likelihood of a de novo event in the absence of affected parents, and the variable expressivity of the disorder. There is no evidence of a predictable genotype-phenotype correlation to guide prognosis.\n\n#### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Radio, F. et al. (2021) PMID: 33545124:** This landmark study defined the clinical syndrome associated with SPEN haploinsufficiency in 34 individuals, establishing the core phenotypic features, confirming haploinsufficiency as the mechanism, and identifying a specific X-chromosome episignature in females.\n*   **Coe, B.P. et al. (2019) PMID: 30100085:** A meta-analysis of de novo mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders identified SPEN as a high-confidence candidate gene with an excess of likely gene-disrupting variants.\n*   **Iossifov, I. et al. (2014) PMID: 25363768:** One of the earlier large-scale studies that identified a de novo likely gene-disrupting variant in SPEN in a proband with autism spectrum disorder, highlighting it as a candidate gene.\n*   **Ariani, F. et al. (2008) PMID: 18451010:** Although not the focus, this paper on X-chromosome inactivation mechanisms provided early insights into the function of SPEN, which was later connected to the human disease phenotype.\n*   **Wieland, I. et al. (2004) PMID: 15286788:** A study that characterized the SHARP (SPEN) protein, identifying its SPOC domain and role as a potent transcriptional corepressor for nuclear receptors.\n\n#### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Any pathogenic protein-truncating variant (nonsense or frameshift) in SPEN is strongly associated with the core phenotype of global developmental delay (HP:0001263), intellectual disability (HP:0001249), hypotonia (HP:0001252), and behavioral abnormalities (HP:0000718).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The combination of a significant neurodevelopmental disorder (intellectual disability, autism) with congenital heart defects (HP:0001627), early feeding difficulties (HP:0011968), and later-onset obesity (HP:0001513) should raise strong suspicion for a pathogenic variant in SPEN.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The primary differential diagnosis is 1p36 deletion syndrome, due to the significant clinical overlap. Other syndromes associated with intellectual disability, hypotonia, and heart defects should also be considered.\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in SPEN (2/2):\nN/A.

        "PFKM": "PFKM Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** PFKM (HGNC:8877)\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 610681\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Glycogen storage disease type VII (GSDVII), also known as Tarui disease (OMIM: 232800).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Definitive. Biallelic pathogenic variants in PFKM are the established cause of GSDVII.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** GSDVII is an autosomal recessive disorder.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    *   pLI (Probability of being Loss-of-function Intolerant): 0.01 (gnomAD v2.1.1)\n    *   LOEUF (Loss-of-function Observed/Expected Upper bound Fraction): 1.15 (gnomAD v2.1.1)\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI score and high LOEUF score indicate that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This is consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, where heterozygous carriers are typically asymptomatic.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Pathogenicity arises from biallelic variants, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations, that result in a nonfunctional or severely impaired enzyme.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0003236 Exercise intolerance\n    *   HP:0001265 Myalgia\n    *   HP:0002878 Myoglobinuria\n    *   HP:0001890 Hemolytic anemia\n    *   HP:0001541 Myopathy\n    *   HP:0003208 Hyperuricemia\n    *   HP:0003198 Rhabdomyolysis\n    *   HP:0001270 Motor delay\n    *   HP:0001324 Muscle weakness\n    *   HP:0001947 Jaundice\n    *   HP:0002240 Hepatomegaly\n    *   HP:0002616 Splenomegaly\n    *   HP:0001878 Reticulocytosis\n    *   HP:0000286 High palate\n    *   HP:0003391 Muscle cramps\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001638 Cardiomyopathy\n    *   HP:0001511 Intrauterine growth retardation\n    *   HP:0001622 Premature birth\n    *   HP:0000407 Sensory axonal neuropathy\n    *   HP:0001263 Global developmental delay\n    *   HP:0002014 Diarrhea\n    *   HP:0002027 Abdominal pain\n    *   HP:0002017 Nausea and vomiting\n    *   HP:0000789 Inguinal hernia\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The classic form typically presents in childhood or adolescence with exercise-induced symptoms. A severe, infantile-onset form can present with progressive weakness, hypotonia, and early death. A late-onset form with mild, fixed weakness may also occur.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity is highly variable, ranging from mild, compensated hemolysis and exercise intolerance to severe infantile-onset myopathy leading to early death.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygosity for null mutations (e.g., frameshift, nonsense, or major rearrangements) that completely abolish enzyme activity is often associated with the severe, lethal infantile form of GSDVII. Compound heterozygotes with one null allele and one missense allele may have variable presentations.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Mutations in the allosteric binding sites, such as the D543A variant, can disrupt the enzyme's regulation by ATP, leading to a classic GSDVII phenotype. No strong, consistent genotype-phenotype correlations have been established for most variants.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Generally considered weak to moderate, as significant clinical heterogeneity is observed even within families sharing the same mutations. While biallelic null mutations often lead to a severe outcome, the phenotypic expression of missense variants is less predictable.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.2065G>A (p.Gly689Arg):** Pathogenic; associated with classic GSDVII phenotypes including exercise intolerance and hemolysis.\n*   **c.1628A>C (p.Asp543Ala) / rs121918194:** Conflicting interpretations of pathogenicity; located in an activating binding site, disrupts allosteric regulation, associated with classic GSDVII. AF (gnomAD): 0.00002.\n*   **IVS5+1G>A:** Pathogenic; a splice-site mutation common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, results in a nonfunctional protein and classic GSDVII.\n*   **c.1416+1G>A (IVS12+1G>A):** Pathogenic; a common splice-site mutation leading to exon skipping and a severely truncated, inactive enzyme.\n*   **c.1127G>A (p.Arg376Gln) / rs187131358:** Uncertain significance; reported in GSDVII cases but functional impact is not fully defined. AF (gnomAD): 0.00001.\n*   **c.1376G>A (p.Arg459His):** Novel variant reported as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in a compound heterozygous state, associated with muscle weakness and hemolysis.\n*   **c.626G>A (p.Arg209His):** Novel variant reported as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in a compound heterozygous state, associated with muscle weakness and hemolysis.\n*   **c.926A>G (p.Asp309Gly):** Pathogenic; predicted to severely affect enzyme catalysis, leading to classic GSDVII symptoms.\n*   **c.1087C>T (p.Arg363Cys):** Pathogenic; associated with late-onset myopathy.\n*   **c.2224delG (p.Val742fs):** Pathogenic; a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon and a nonfunctional protein.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** Skeletal muscle shows the highest expression of PFKM, which directly correlates with the primary phenotype of exertional myopathy and exercise intolerance.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:**\n    *   **Muscle:** Deficiency of the M-subunit tetramer (PFK-M4) causes a block in glycolysis, leading to ATP depletion during exercise, cramps, and myoglobinuria.\n    *   **Erythrocytes:** Red blood cells express a combination of M and L (liver) subunits; deficiency of the M subunit leads to partial enzyme deficiency, cell instability, and compensated hemolytic anemia.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Expression patterns during development are critical, and defects can lead to the severe infantile-onset form of the disease with early lethality.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The PFKM gene encodes the muscle-specific isoform of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1), a key enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate in glycolysis.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary disease mechanism is a loss-of-function, consistent with its autosomal recessive inheritance. Biallelic mutations lead to deficient or absent PFK-M subunit activity.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Glycolysis Blockade:** In muscle, the inability to perform glycolysis blocks the primary pathway for ATP generation from glucose during intense exercise, causing energy deficiency, accumulation of upstream glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate, and exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis.\n    *   **Erythrocyte Metabolism:** In red blood cells, the partial enzyme defect impairs glycolysis, leading to reduced ATP and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate levels, which increases hemoglobin's oxygen affinity and promotes hemolysis.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** PFKM subunits homotetramerize to form the active enzyme in muscle (PFK-M4). In erythrocytes, PFKM and PFKL subunits form heterotetramers; the lack of functional PFKM subunits disrupts the stability and function of these complexes.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** Genetic testing via whole-exome or genome sequencing in patients with a clinical suspicion of GSDVII has a high diagnostic yield, often identifying biallelic pathogenic variants in PFKM.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** The most common indications for testing are exercise intolerance starting in childhood, exertional myalgia, myoglobinuria, and the combination of myopathy with compensated hemolytic anemia.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Management is primarily supportive, including avoidance of strenuous exercise. A high-protein or ketogenic diet may provide alternative energy sources for muscle. Monitoring for hemolytic episodes and renal function (due to myoglobinuria risk) is crucial.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal/preimplantation genetic diagnosis are options for families with known pathogenic variants.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 3901988 (1985):** A landmark study describing the molecular basis of the disease in Ashkenazi Jewish patients, identifying a common splicing mutation.\n*   **PMID: 8527230 (1995):** Characterized the PFKM gene structure and identified several mutations, helping to establish the genetic basis and heterogeneity of Tarui disease.\n*   **PMID: 19707255 (2009):** Described the generation of a Pfkm-deficient mouse model, which recapitulated key features of human GSDVII including exercise intolerance, hemolysis, and early death in severe cases, providing insights into the systemic nature of the disease.\n*   **PMID: 2602744 (1990):** Reported on the diversity of mutations in the PFKM gene, including deletions and single nucleotide changes, expanding the known variant spectrum.\n*   **PMID: 38830768 (2024):** A recent case report identifying two novel compound heterozygous mutations (c.1376G>A and c.626G>A) via WGS/WES in a patient with GSDVII, highlighting the ongoing discovery of new variants and the clinical utility of comprehensive genomic testing.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Biallelic null variants (frameshift, nonsense, canonical splice site) are strongly associated with a severe phenotype that can include infantile onset (HP:0003593), progressive muscle weakness (HP:0003323), and early death. The IVS5+1G>A variant is strongly associated with classic GSDVII in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals, presenting with exercise intolerance (HP:0003236), myalgia (HP:0001265), and hemolytic anemia (HP:0001890).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis (HP:0003198) or myoglobinuria (HP:0002878) with evidence of compensated hemolysis (e.g., reticulocytosis HP:0001878, elevated indirect bilirubin) is highly suggestive of pathogenic variants in PFKM.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The myopathic features overlap with other glycogen storage diseases, particularly McArdle disease (GSDV, caused by PYGM variants), and other metabolic myopathies. The hemolytic anemia component distinguishes GSDVII from many other GSDs and should prompt consideration of red cell enzymopathies like pyruvate kinase deficiency.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PFKM (2/2):\nN/A.

        "MCM7": "MCM7 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n\u2013 **HGNC ID:** 6950\n\u2013 **OMIM Gene ID:** 600592\n\u2013 **Primary Disease Associations:**\n    - Autosomal Recessive Primary Microcephaly (MCPH) and Intellectual Disability\n    - Meier-Gorlin Syndrome\n    - A multi-system disorder with features including neonatal progeroid appearance, lipodystrophy, and adrenal insufficiency\n\u2013 **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for association with the above phenotypes is emerging, with case reports and functional studies supporting pathogenicity.\n\u2013 **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Autosomal recessive inheritance is documented for primary microcephaly and Meier-Gorlin syndrome-related phenotypes.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\u2013 **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    - The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score is a metric to assess a gene's tolerance to protein-truncating variants, with a value \u2265 0.9 indicating extreme intolerance.\n    - The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is a continuous metric of a gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variation.\n\u2013 **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The gnomAD database provides constraint scores like pLI and LOEUF that help in interpreting variant pathogenicity. Low LOEUF scores suggest a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variation.\n\u2013 **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Biallelic missense and likely loss-of-function variants have been reported as pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\u2013 **Primary HPO terms:**\n    - Microcephaly (HP:0000252)\n    - Severe intellectual disability (HP:0010864)\n    - Growth delay (HP:0001510)\n    - Speech impairment\n    - Motor impairment\n    - Behavioral abnormalities\n    - Adrenal insufficiency (HP:0000846)\n    - Lipodystrophy (HP:0009125)\n    - Progeroid appearance\n\u2013 **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    - Frontal bossing (HP:0002007)\n\u2013 **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes such as primary microcephaly are congenital. Other features like lipodystrophy and adrenal insufficiency can develop later in life.\n\u2013 **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with MCM7 variants can range from typical Meier-Gorlin syndrome to a more complex and severe multi-system disorder.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\u2013 **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous missense mutations have been linked to autosomal recessive primary microcephaly with intellectual disability. Biallelic variants, including missense mutations, are associated with a spectrum from Meier-Gorlin syndrome to a progeroid syndrome with lipodystrophy and adrenal insufficiency.\n\u2013 **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The MCM7 protein contains a highly conserved MCM domain essential for its function. A homozygous missense variant (p.Ala265Thr) located in a highly conserved region has been identified in patients with primary microcephaly and intellectual disability.\n\u2013 **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** There is an emerging correlation between biallelic MCM7 variants and developmental disorders. However, the observation of disparate clinical features in patients with similar variant profiles suggests a complex genotype-phenotype relationship that may be influenced by other factors.\n\u2013 **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    - A homozygous missense variant c.793G>A (p.Ala265T) in MCM7 was identified in three individuals with primary microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, and motor and speech impairments.\n    - A patient with typical Meier-Gorlin syndrome was found to have biallelic variants in MCM7.\n    - Another patient with a multi-system disorder including progeroid appearance, lipodystrophy, and adrenal insufficiency also had biallelic MCM7 variants.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.793G>A (p.Ala265T)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Primary microcephaly, severe intellectual disability, speech and motor impairments\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.1579C>T (p.Arg527Ter)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.776G>C (p.Gly259Ala)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.1616A>G (p.Tyr539Cys)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\u2013 **NM_005916.5(MCM7):c.415C>T (p.Gln139Ter)** / rs-not-available / Pathogenic / Meier-Gorlin syndrome\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\u2013 **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** MCM7 is highly expressed in proliferating cells. Studies in mice show high expression of Mcm7 in the proliferative zones of the brain during early development, consistent with its role in neurogenesis. This aligns with the neurological phenotypes, such as microcephaly, observed in patients.\n\u2013 **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its crucial role in DNA replication, pathogenic variants in MCM7 are expected to affect rapidly dividing tissues, leading to developmental defects like microcephaly and growth retardation.\n\u2013 **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Mcm7 expression is higher during early mouse developmental stages. This is consistent with congenital phenotypes like primary microcephaly.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\u2013 **Normal Gene Function in One Sentence:** MCM7 is a core component of the MCM2-7 complex, which functions as the replicative helicase essential for initiating and elongating DNA replication once per cell cycle.\n\u2013 **Disease Mechanism:** Pathogenic variants in MCM7 can lead to a dysfunctional protein, impairing the formation and function of the MCM complex. This results in reduced efficiency of S-phase progression and can lead to genomic instability. The mechanism is generally considered loss-of-function.\n\u2013 **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the MCM2-7 complex function impairs DNA replication, which is fundamental for cell proliferation. Inaccurate DNA replication can lead to a decrease in proliferating cells, particularly in critical developmental processes like neurogenesis, resulting in brain malformations such as microcephaly. The MCM complex is a key part of the pre-replication complex (pre_RC).\n\u2013 **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** MCM7 interacts with other MCM proteins (MCM2-6) to form the hexameric MCM complex. Variants can disrupt these interactions, affecting the stability and function of the entire complex.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\u2013 **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Whole-exome sequencing has been successful in identifying biallelic MCM7 variants in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders and features of Meier-Gorlin syndrome.\n\u2013 **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for MCM7 variants should be considered in patients presenting with primary microcephaly, intellectual disability, and/or features of Meier-Gorlin syndrome, especially when other known causes have been excluded.\n\u2013 **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, management is supportive and tailored to the patient's specific symptoms. A definitive molecular diagnosis can guide genetic counseling.\n\u2013 **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For autosomal recessive conditions, parents of an affected child are obligate carriers. There is a 25% chance of having another affected child with each pregnancy.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\u2013 **PMID: 34059554, 2022:** Reported a homozygous missense mutation in MCM7 causing autosomal recessive primary microcephaly and intellectual disability, highlighting the crucial role of MCM7 in nervous system development.\n\u2013 **PMID: 33654309, 2021:** Described biallelic MCM7 variants in patients with a phenotypic spectrum from Meier-Gorlin syndrome to a multi-system disorder with lipodystrophy and adrenal insufficiency, expanding the clinical genetics of disrupted DNA replication.\n\u2013 **New Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Discovered:** Recent studies have established a link between biallelic MCM7 mutations and a spectrum of human developmental disorders, including primary microcephaly and Meier-Gorlin syndrome-related phenotypes.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\u2013 **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    - Homozygous missense variants (e.g., p.Ala265T) are strongly associated with a phenotype of primary microcephaly (HP:0000252) and severe intellectual disability (HP:0010864).\n    - Biallelic variants, including truncating and missense changes, are associated with growth delay (HP:0001510) and features of Meier-Gorlin syndrome.\n\u2013 **Phenotype red flags:**\n    - The combination of congenital microcephaly (HP:0000252), severe intellectual disability (HP:0010864), and growth retardation (HP:0001510) in the absence of other major malformations is highly suggestive of an MCM7-related disorder.\n\u2013 **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**\n    - The phenotype of MCM7 mutations overlaps with other disorders caused by variants in genes involved in DNA replication and repair. This includes other forms of autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH) and Meier-Gorlin syndrome caused by mutations in genes like ORC1, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1, and CDC6.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in MCM7 (2/2):\nN/A.

Much of the literature points to the significance of its receptor, IL7R.\n\u2013 **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Autosomal recessive for IMD130.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\u2013 **pLI, LOEUF, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics for *IL7* show a pLI of 0.00, a pNull of 0.99, and a loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) of 0.81.\n\u2013 **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The very low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that *IL7* is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene. Genes with low LOEUF scores show strong selection against predicted LoF variation, whereas higher scores suggest greater tolerance.\n\u2013 **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Based on the tolerance to LoF variants, pathogenic variants, when they occur, would more likely be missense or other variants that do not result in a complete loss of function, though this is speculative given the rarity of associated disease.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\u2013 **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0002715 - Abnormality of the immune system\n    *   HP:0002829 - T-cell lymphopenia\n    *   HP:0005510 - CD4-positive, alpha-beta T-cell lymphopenia\n    *   HP:0002721 - Immunodeficiency\n    *   HP:0100521 - Verrucae\n    *   HP:0001058 - Plaque-like skin lesions\n    *   HP:0000962 - Hyperkeratosis\n    *   HP:0012432 - Susceptibility to human papillomavirus infection\n    *   HP:0002240 - Hepatomegaly\n    *   HP:0001875 - Neutropenia\n\u2013 **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0002843 - Susceptibility to mycobacterial infections\n    *   HP:0002841 - Recurrent herpes simplex virus infections\n    *   HP:0002835 - Recurrent fungal infections\n    *   HP:0001250 - Seizures\n    *   HP:0001634 - Atrial septal defect\n    *   HP:0001290 - Generalized hypotonia\n    *   HP:0001263 - Global developmental delay\n    *   HP:0000252 - Microcephaly\n\u2013 **Age of Onset Patterns:** The onset of immunodeficiency is typically in infancy or early childhood.\n\u2013 **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of IMD130 can be significant, leading to persistent and widespread viral and other infections, with an increased risk of skin cancer.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\u2013 **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous loss-of-function variants, such as nonsense and frameshift mutations, are associated with Immunodeficiency 130 with HPV-related verrucosis.\n\u2013 **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Data is limited for IL7 itself, but for its receptor, IL7R, mutations in different domains lead to varying phenotypes, from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) to autoimmunity.\n\u2013 **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between homozygous loss-of-function *IL7* variants and IMD130 appears strong based on limited case reports.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n\u2013 **rs1486611027 / p.Arg69Ter (c.205C>T):** Pathogenic for Immunodeficiency 130 with HPV-related verrucosis (HPO: HP:0100521, HP:0002829). AF: Not reported in gnomAD.\n\u2013 **c.284del:** Pathogenic for Immunodeficiency 130 with HPV-related verrucosis. AF: Not reported in gnomAD.\n\u2013 **MET1?:** Pathogenic for Immunodeficiency 130 with HPV-related verrucosis. AF: Not reported in gnomAD.\n\u2013 **rs2587156:** This SNP showed a near-significant association with multiple sclerosis in one study.\n\u2013 **rs1054283:** This SNP showed a significant association with multiple sclerosis.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\u2013 **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to the Human Protein Atlas, *IL7* shows the highest expression in the lymph node and small intestine. RNA-seq data from GTEx also shows expression in the spleen, tonsil, and appendix.\n\u2013 **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The expression profile in lymphoid tissues is consistent with its critical role in T and B cell development and homeostasis. Dysfunction would be expected to primarily manifest as immunodeficiency. Expression in the intestine by epithelial cells suggests a role in mucosal immunity.\n\u2013 **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** *IL7* is crucial for early T-cell development in the thymus. Its role in B-cell development in humans appears to be more important in adulthood than in the neonatal period.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\u2013 **Normal Gene Function:** IL7 is a hematopoietic growth factor essential for the development, proliferation, and survival of lymphoid progenitors, particularly T and B cells.\n\u2013 **Disease Mechanism:** For IMD130, the mechanism is loss-of-function due to biallelic pathogenic variants, leading to a deficiency of the IL-7 cytokine. This impairs T-cell development and homeostasis.\n\u2013 **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** IL-7 signals through a receptor complex that activates the JAK-STAT and PI3K-Akt pathways. Disruption of this signaling cascade due to IL-7 deficiency leads to failed T-cell development (especially CD4+ T cells), resulting in severe T-cell lymphopenia and susceptibility to infections, particularly HPV. The cytokine also plays a role in regulating the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.\n\u2013 **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** IL-7 interacts with its receptor, which consists of the IL-7R\u03b1 (IL7RA) and the common gamma chain (\u03b3c or IL2RG). This interaction is crucial for initiating the downstream signaling cascade required for lymphocyte development and survival.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\u2013 **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for *IL7* variants is likely low yield and would be considered in patients with a specific phenotype of T-cell lymphopenia and severe, recalcitrant HPV infections after more common causes of immunodeficiency have been excluded.\n\u2013 **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** The primary reason for testing would be a clinical presentation consistent with IMD130, including T-cell lymphopenia and extensive verrucosis.\n\u2013 **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** For patients with confirmed IMD130, management would focus on aggressive treatment of infections and surveillance for skin malignancies. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could be a consideration, though its efficacy for this specific disorder is not well-documented in the search results.\n\u2013 **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For families with a confirmed pathogenic variant, autosomal recessive inheritance should be discussed. This implies a 25% recurrence risk for future offspring of carrier parents. Carrier testing for at-risk family members could be considered.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\u2013 **PMID: 23392398 (2013):** Discusses the role of IL-7R in autoimmunity and immunodeficiency, highlighting that defects in IL-7R, not typically IL7 itself, are a more common cause of human SCID.\n\u2013 **PMID: 15164028 (2004):** A comprehensive review detailing the role of IL-7 in lymphocyte development and homeostasis, outlining its signaling pathways via JAK/STAT.\n\u2013 **PMID: 20111038 (2010):** A study identifying genetic variations in the IL7RA/IL7 pathway that increase susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, pointing to a role in autoimmune disease.\n\u2013 **Not available (2025):** A 2025 review article summarizing the role of IL-7 in various autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, and its mechanisms of action.\n\u2013 **PMID: 21873468 (2012):** Reviews the impact of deletions, polymorphisms, and mutations in the IL-7 receptor gene, providing context for the IL-7 pathway's role in disease.\n\u2013 **PMID: 9559302 (1998):** Describes a novel role for IL-7 in mediating non-T cell, non-B cell colitis in a mouse model, suggesting broader inflammatory functions.\n\u2013 **PMID: 29892010 (2018):** Research indicating that IL-7 and its receptor are involved in the development of various cancers by mediating multiple cell signaling pathways.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\u2013 **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Homozygous loss-of-function variants (e.g., p.Arg69Ter) are strongly associated with T-cell lymphopenia (HP:0002829) and susceptibility to human papillomavirus infection leading to verrucae (HP:0100521).\n\u2013 **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of severe, disseminated verrucosis and significant T-cell lymphopenia (particularly low CD4+ counts) should raise strong suspicion for a defect in the IL-7 pathway, including potential *IL7* deficiency.\n\u2013 **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of T-cell lymphopenia overlaps with numerous other primary immunodeficiencies, including those caused by mutations in *IL7R*, *IL2RG*, *JAK3*, *RAG1/2*, and others. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis can also be caused by mutations in *EVER1* (*TMC6*) and *EVER2* (*TMC8*).\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in IL7 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "TCHH": "TCHH Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID, OMIM gene ID, primary disease associations**: The HGNC ID is HGNC:11786, and the OMIM gene ID is 190345. It is primarily associated with Uncombable Hair Syndrome 3 (UHS3), with OMIM MIM number 617252.\n*   **Clinical significance level**: The association between TCHH and Uncombable Hair Syndrome is classified as definitive.\n*   **Inheritance patterns observed in patients**: The inheritance pattern is typically autosomal recessive. Some cases result from compound heterozygosity.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: In gnomAD v4.0.0, the scores for TCHH are a pLI of 0.01, a LOEUF of 1.15, a pRec of 0.77, and a pNull of 0.23.\n*   **Clinical interpretation of constraint scores**: The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variants, which is consistent with its association with a recessive disease.\n*   **Variant classes most likely to be pathogenic**: Pathogenic variants are typically loss-of-function, including nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants. Missense variants have also been documented as causative.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**: The most frequently reported HPO terms are Uncombable hair (HP:0002264), Pili canaliculi (HP:0003780), Triangular hair shaft (HP:0003781), Hair shaft grooves (HP:0003782), and Spun-glass hair (HP:0002265). A silvery-blond hair color is also a characteristic feature.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**: Less common, but documented, HPO terms include Hypotrichosis (HP:0001006), Sparse hair (HP:0008070), Abnormality of hair texture (HP:0002241), Blond hair (HP:0002213), and Alopecia (HP:0001596).\n*   **Age of onset patterns**: The phenotype usually becomes apparent in early childhood, typically between the ages of 3 months and 3 years, and may show improvement as the individual gets older.\n*   **Phenotype severity spectrum**: The severity can vary from hair that is simply unruly to the classic, severe \"spun-glass\" hair that is impossible to comb flat against the scalp.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant classes and their typical phenotypes**: Biallelic loss-of-function variants, such as nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations, are consistently linked to the classic Uncombable Hair Syndrome 3 phenotype.\n*   **Protein domain-specific phenotype patterns**: Pathogenic variants have been identified throughout the TCHH gene, suggesting that the disruption of the overall protein, rather than a specific domain, is responsible for the disease.\n*   **Genotype-phenotype correlation strength**: There is a strong correlation between the presence of biallelic pathogenic variants in TCHH and the clinical presentation of uncombable hair syndrome.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes**: The compound heterozygous variants c.1610del (p.Gly537Alafs*52) and c.2665C>T (p.Arg889*) have been documented to cause classic uncombable hair syndrome. Similarly, a homozygous frameshift variant, c.1189dupA (p.Ile397Asnfs*11), results in the same condition.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1189dupA (p.Ile397Asnfs*11)**: Pathogenic; associated with Uncombable hair syndrome 3 (HP:0002264); allele frequency not reported.\n*   **c.2665C>T (p.Arg889*)**: Pathogenic; associated with Uncombable hair syndrome 3 (HP:0002264); allele frequency not reported.\n*   **c.1610del (p.Gly537Alafs*52)**: Pathogenic; associated with Uncombable hair syndrome 3 (HP:0002264); allele frequency not reported.\n*   **c.3031C>T (p.Gln1011*)**: Pathogenic; associated with Uncombable hair (HP:0002264); allele frequency not reported.\n*   **c.3376C>T (p.Arg1126*)**: Pathogenic; associated with Uncombable hair (HP:0002264); allele frequency not reported.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest expressing tissues (GTEx TPM) and clinical correlation**: GTEx data shows the highest expression of TCHH in the skin (sun-exposed and non-sun-exposed sites with TPMs of 138.8 and 112.5, respectively). High expression is specifically localized to the inner root sheath of the hair follicle, which directly correlates with the hair-specific phenotype.\n*   **Tissue-specific phenotypes expected**: Given the highly specific expression pattern, phenotypes are expected to be confined to the hair.\n*   **Expression during development and age-related phenotypes**: TCHH is critical for proper hair shaft formation during the anagen (growth) phase of the hair cycle. The onset of symptoms in early childhood corresponds to the initial hair growth cycles.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal gene function**: Trichohyalin (TCHH) is an intermediate filament-associated protein that provides structural integrity to the inner root sheath of the hair follicle.\n*   **Disease mechanism**: Uncombable Hair Syndrome 3 is caused by a loss-of-function mechanism, where pathogenic variants prevent the proper cross-linking of keratin intermediate filaments within the hair shaft.\n*   **Cellular/molecular pathways disrupted \u2192 phenotype consequences**: The disruption of keratinization and the formation of the cornified envelope in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle leads to a malformed, grooved hair shaft, resulting in the characteristic uncombable hair phenotype.\n*   **Protein-protein interactions relevant to phenotype**: TCHH interacts with keratin intermediate filaments and is cross-linked by transglutaminase 3 (TGM3). Notably, mutations in TGM3 are also a cause of uncombable hair syndrome.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic yield in clinical cohorts**: For individuals presenting with a clinical diagnosis of uncombable hair syndrome, genetic testing of TCHH, along with PADI3 and TGM3, identifies the causative variants in a high percentage of cases.\n*   **Most common reasons for testing this gene**: The primary indication for testing is a clinical suspicion of uncombable hair syndrome, based on characteristic features like \"spun-glass\" hair, difficulty in combing, and a triangular cross-section of the hair shaft on microscopy.\n*   **Clinical actionability and management implications**: A molecular diagnosis confirms the cause of the phenotype. Management is supportive and involves gentle hair care practices, with the understanding that the condition often improves with age.\n*   **Genetic counseling considerations**: Genetic counseling for autosomal recessive inheritance is recommended. Heterozygous carriers of a pathogenic variant are typically unaffected.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 27851900, year: 2016**: This landmark study was the first to identify biallelic pathogenic variants in TCHH, PADI3, and TGM3 as the genetic cause of uncombable hair syndrome.\n*   **PMID: 28129089, year: 2017**: This paper reported novel compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in TCHH, thereby expanding the known mutational spectrum of the gene.\n*   **PMID: 29032158, year: 2017**: This study further solidified the roles of TCHH, PADI3, and TGM3 in uncombable hair syndrome through the analysis of a larger patient cohort.\n*   **PMID: 31737691, year: 2019**: This case report described a novel homozygous frameshift variant in TCHH in a patient diagnosed with uncombable hair syndrome.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: Biallelic loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, or splice site) in TCHH have a high-confidence association with Uncombable hair (HP:0002264), Pili canaliculi (HP:0003780), and Triangular hair shaft (HP:0003781).\n*   **Phenotype red flags**: The combination of Uncombable hair (HP:0002264) and Pili canaliculi (HP:0003780) presenting in early childhood should raise strong suspicion for pathogenic variants in TCHH or the other two causative genes, PADI3 and TGM3.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**: The clinical phenotype of uncombable hair caused by TCHH variants is indistinguishable from that caused by pathogenic variants in PADI3 and TGM3. Therefore, diagnostic testing is often performed using a gene panel that includes all three genes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in TCHH (1/1):\nN/A.

        "CNN2": "CNN2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Clinical Genetics Dossier: CNN2**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** CNN2\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** No OMIM gene entry was found. However, GWAS studies have linked the gene to phenotypes like bone density and reticulocyte measurements.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Currently, there are no established Mendelian diseases definitively associated with CNN2. It has been investigated in the context of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer's disease.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of CNN2 variants is largely unknown, with most information coming from GWAS and expression studies rather than established disease cohorts. There are no definitive or strong disease associations reported.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Inheritance patterns are not well-defined due to the lack of a clear associated Mendelian disease.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Using gnomAD v2.1.1 data, the pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) score is 0.00, suggesting tolerance to haploinsufficiency. The pRec score is 0.81, and the pNull score is 0.19. The LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) is a more recent metric, and a low value indicates intolerance; for CNN2, specific values were not found in the search.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The extremely low pLI score indicates that loss-of-function variants in CNN2 are observed at frequencies expected in the general population, making haploinsufficiency an unlikely disease mechanism. The gene is not considered constrained against protein-truncating variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be gain-of-function or have a dominant-negative effect. However, no such variants have been characterized.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are directly linked to CNN2 in databases like OMIM or ClinVar as there is no established associated monogenic disorder.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** While no direct links exist, GWAS data suggests a potential association with skeletal and hematological phenotypes, such as 'Abnormality of bone mineral density' (HP:0004349) and 'Abnormality of reticulocyte count' (HP:0040281).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable as no specific inherited disorder is defined. Research has implicated it in age-related conditions.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Due to the absence of confirmed pathogenic variants causing a Mendelian disease, there are no established correlations between variant classes and specific phenotypes.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** CNN2 contains a Calponin Homology (CH) domain, which is crucial for actin binding. Variants disrupting this domain could theoretically affect cytoskeletal functions, but specific phenotype patterns have not been documented.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Weak to non-existent. Current data does not support any strong genotype-phenotype correlations.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** A variant (p.P232H) was identified in a whole-exome sequencing study of Alzheimer's disease, but its pathogenicity was not established.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for CNN2 are listed in ClinVar. DECIPHER also holds no open-access sequence variants for this gene.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, CNN2 shows the highest expression in smooth muscle tissues, including the aorta, colon, and uterus. It is also expressed in the spleen, lung, and thyroid.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Based on its high expression in smooth muscle, variants could theoretically lead to phenotypes affecting vascular, gastrointestinal, or uterine function. Its expression in immune cells like monocytes could suggest a role in inflammatory responses.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** CNN2 expression is noted in growing smooth muscle tissues during embryonic development. Its potential involvement in age-related diseases like AMD and Alzheimer's suggests its function may be relevant later in life.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** CNN2 is a thin filament-associated protein that regulates and modulates smooth muscle contraction by binding to actin, calmodulin, and tropomyosin, and inhibiting actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** No clear disease mechanism has been established for CNN2-related phenotypes. Haploinsufficiency is unlikely given the gnomAD constraint data.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** CNN2 is involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and stabilization. Disruption could impact cell motility, adhesion, and morphology. It is also implicated in pathways like neutrophil degranulation and JAK-STAT signaling.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** CNN2 interacts with actin, calmodulin, and tropomyosin. These interactions are fundamental to its role in regulating the cytoskeleton and muscle contraction.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for CNN2 is effectively zero, as it is not typically included in clinical gene panels for specific disorders due to a lack of disease association.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for this gene would be purely for research purposes, for instance, in studies of GWAS hits for complex traits or in broad whole-exome/genome sequencing where its relevance is being explored.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There is currently no clinical actionability associated with variants in CNN2.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling would focus on the uncertainty of findings in CNN2, emphasizing the lack of evidence for its role in causing human disease and the high tolerance for variation in the general population.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 27150165, Year: 2016:** This review summarizes the structure, function, and regulation of the three calponin isoforms (CNN1, CNN2, CNN3), highlighting their roles in smooth muscle contractility and non-muscle cell motility. It notes that CNN2 is involved in cell proliferation and adhesion.\n*   **PMID: 9, Year: not specified:** Research on NCBI indicates a potential role for CNN2 in cancer progression, specifically in hepatocellular carcinoma and gastric cancer, possibly through the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling pathway.\n*   **PMID: not specified, Year: not specified:** GWAS catalog results suggest associations between CNN2 and bone density, as well as reticulocyte measurements, pointing to potential roles in bone and hematopoietic systems.\n*   **PMID: not specified, Year: not specified:** A study on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) suggested a possible immunological role for the CNN2 locus, noting its colocalization with an eQTL for CNN2 in monocytes.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** There are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for CNN2.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are currently no \"red flag\" HPO terms that would strongly suggest pathogenic variants in CNN2.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Not applicable due to the lack of a defined CNN2-related disorder.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in CNN2 (1/1):\nN/A.

Genes with these scores are under strong selective pressure against heterozygous inactivating mutations, making LoF variants highly likely to be pathogenic.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Biallelic loss-of-function variants (e.g., frameshift, nonsense, large deletions) are associated with the most severe phenotypes. Homozygous missense variants are also clearly pathogenic but may result in a comparatively less severe, though still significant, neurodevelopmental disorder.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).\n    *   Intellectual disability, severe (HP:0010864).\n    *   Hypotonia (HP:0001252).\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   Gait instability / Ataxia (HP:0002141 / HP:0001251).\n    *   Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0000729).\n    *   Feeding difficulties (HP:0011968).\n    *   Microcephaly (HP:0000252).\n    *   Visual impairment (HP:0000505).\n    *   Hearing impairment (HP:0000365).\n    *   Structural brain anomalies (e.g., corpus callosum agenesis) (HP:0001277).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Plagiocephaly (HP:0001357).\n    *   Narrow palate (HP:0000189).\n    *   Prognathism (HP:0000303).\n    *   Sandal gap (HP:0001852).\n    *   Renal anomalies (HP:0000077).\n    *   Dilated cardiomyopathy (HP:0001644).\n    *   Hyperactivity (HP:0000752).\n    *   Diminished ability to concentrate (HP:0002324).\n    *   Blue irides (HP:0000632) (as a trait, not pathology).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically in infancy, with hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and developmental delays being early signs. Seizures may also begin in the first year of life.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity ranges from a non-lethal, Angelman-like syndrome with developmental delay and autism to a severe, sometimes lethal, neonatal disorder with profound disability and multi-system involvement, depending on the variant type. Biallelic LoF variants lead to a more severe phenotype than missense mutations.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Biallelic Loss-of-Function (frameshift, nonsense, large deletions):** These variants cause a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by profound intellectual disability, structural brain anomalies, seizures, feeding problems, and sometimes perinatal lethality.\n    *   **Homozygous Missense Variants (e.g., p.Pro594Leu):** These are associated with an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with features like global developmental delay, an unstable gait, lack of speech, and autistic features, which has been compared to Angelman syndrome. The phenotype is generally less severe than that caused by LoF variants.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The p.Pro594Leu missense mutation, located in the first RCC1-like domain (RLD), is specifically linked to the Angelman-like syndrome found in Old Order Amish populations. Variants that lead to a complete loss of the HECT domain result in the most severe phenotypes due to the loss of E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** There is a strong correlation between the type of biallelic variant and the severity of the clinical phenotype. Complete loss-of-function is consistently associated with more severe outcomes than specific missense mutations.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   **c.1781C>T (p.Pro594Leu):** Homozygosity for this missense variant is associated with Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Autosomal Recessive 38 (MRT38), an Angelman-like syndrome with developmental delay, autism, and gait instability.\n    *   **Homozygous Deletion of *HERC2* and *OCA2*:** Results in severe developmental abnormalities, including profound intellectual disability and lack of motor development.\n    *   **Homozygous Frameshift Variants (leading to protein truncation):** Associated with a distinct, severe, and sometimes lethal neurodevelopmental disorder with blindness and perinatal mortality.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1781C>T (p.Pro594Leu):** rs397518474 / Pathogenic / Intellectual developmental disorder, autosomal recessive 38; autism spectrum disorder; gait instability / AF: Extremely low, primarily found in Old Order Amish and Mennonite populations.\n*   **c.12988C>T (p.Gln4330Ter):** Not specified / Pathogenic / No specific phenotype reported in ClinVar entry / AF: Not provided.\n*   **Homozygous deletion of *HERC2* and *OCA2*:** Not applicable / Pathogenic / Severe neurodevelopmental phenotype with developmental abnormalities / AF: Extremely rare.\n*   **Homozygous frameshift variant (unspecified):** Not specified / Pathogenic / Severe neurodevelopmental disorder, profound developmental delay, blindness, perinatal mortality / AF: Extremely rare.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** *HERC2* is highly expressed in the brain, particularly the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, as well as in the pituitary gland, sural nerve, and testis.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in various brain regions is consistent with the primary phenotype being a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability, seizures, and motor deficits. Expression in the testis may relate to the sterility observed in *Herc2* mutant mice.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The gene has essential roles during embryonic development, especially for neuronal and muscular functions, which explains the early onset and profound nature of the associated neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *HERC2* encodes a large E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that plays a key role in several cellular processes, including DNA damage response, cell cycle control, and protein trafficking by targeting specific proteins for ubiquitination.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary disease mechanism is loss-of-function. Biallelic pathogenic variants lead to a marked reduction or complete absence of functional HERC2 protein, disrupting its ubiquitin ligase activity and other regulatory roles.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Ubiquitin-Proteasome System:** Disruption of HERC2's E3 ligase function impairs the degradation of target proteins, leading to their accumulation and cellular dysfunction. For example, loss of HERC2 function leads to the accumulation of DNA repair proteins like XPA and BRCA1.\n    *   **DNA Damage Response:** HERC2 is involved in regulating DNA repair pathways; its absence can lead to genomic instability.\n    *   **Mitochondrial Function:** HERC2 loss has been shown to impair mitochondrial networks and function, which could contribute to the neurological and cardiac phenotypes observed.\n    *   **MAPK Signaling:** HERC2 deficiency can activate the C-RAF/MKK3/p38 signaling pathway, altering cellular responses to oxidative stress.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** HERC2 interacts with and activates the E3 ligase E6AP (UBE3A), the protein deficient in Angelman syndrome. This interaction likely explains the phenotypic overlap between HERC2-related disorders and Angelman syndrome.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** While not broadly quantified across large cohorts, *HERC2* variants are a known cause of autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in populations with high rates of consanguinity or in specific founder populations like the Old Order Amish.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for *HERC2* is indicated for individuals with global developmental delay, severe intellectual disability, autistic features, gait instability, and seizures, especially if the presentation has features overlapping with Angelman syndrome but with a negative result for *UBE3A* testing. It is also considered in cases of severe, non-specific neurodevelopmental disorders with multi-organ involvement.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Management is supportive and symptomatic, including anti-seizure medications, physical and speech therapy, and management of feeding difficulties. The recent finding of dilated cardiomyopathy in one case suggests that cardiac surveillance may be warranted.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** This is an autosomal recessive condition. Parents of an affected child are obligate carriers and have a 25% chance of having another affected child with each pregnancy. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Puffenberger EG, et al. (2012) & Harlalka GV, et al. (2013):** These foundational papers identified a homozygous missense mutation (p.Pro594Leu) in *HERC2* in Old Order Amish and Mennonite families, establishing the link to an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder with Angelman-like features, including developmental delay and autism.\n*   **Morice-Picard F, et al. (2016):** Described the first case of a complete loss of *HERC2* function due to a homozygous deletion with *OCA2*, resulting in a severe neurodevelopmental phenotype and demonstrating the critical role of the ubiquitin ligase pathway.\n*   **Elpidorou M, et al. (2021):** Reported a homozygous frameshift variant in *HERC2* causing a severe, lethal neurodevelopmental disorder, expanding the phenotypic spectrum to include perinatal mortality and highlighting that null alleles cause a more severe phenotype than missense mutations.\n*   **Vincent KM, et al. (2021):** Synthesized findings from twelve individuals with biallelic *HERC2* variants, delineating a syndromic phenotype of severe neurodevelopmental delay, brain anomalies, seizures, hypotonia, and other systemic issues, contrasting the impact of LoF versus missense variants.\n*   **Garc\u00eda-Cazorla \u00c0, et al. (2022):** Uncovered that *HERC2* deficiency activates the C-RAF/MKK3/p38 signaling pathway, altering the cellular response to oxidative stress and suggesting potential therapeutic targets.\n*   **Isg\u00fcven P, et al. (2024):** Reported a novel *HERC2* variant in siblings with the classic neurodevelopmental phenotype but also dilated cardiomyopathy, expanding the known clinical spectrum and linking HERC2 to mitochondrial energy production in the heart.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   Biallelic loss-of-function variants (frameshift, nonsense, deletions) are strongly associated with a severe phenotype including **Profound global developmental delay (HP:0011344)**, **Structural brain anomalies (HP:0001277)**, **Severe seizures (HP:0001250)**, and potential **Pediatric lethality**.\n    *   The homozygous missense variant **p.Pro594Leu** is specifically correlated with **Intellectual disability (HP:0001249)**, **Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0000729)**, and **Gait instability (HP:0002141)**, presenting as an Angelman-like syndrome.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:**\n    *   A combination of **severe global developmental delay**, **autistic features**, and an **unstable, wide-based gait with uplifted arms** should raise strong suspicion for a *HERC2*-related disorder.\n    *   The presence of Angelman-like features but with normal methylation and sequencing of the *UBE3A* gene is a significant red flag.\n    *   Profound intellectual and motor disability from birth, especially if accompanied by structural brain defects or early death, points towards biallelic LoF variants in *HERC2*.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:**\n    *   **Angelman Syndrome (AS):** Due to significant phenotypic overlap, including developmental delay, seizures, ataxia, and speech impairment. AS is caused by defects in the maternally expressed *UBE3A* gene.\n    *   **Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS):** Less overlap, but the *HERC2* gene is located in the critical 15q11-q13 region associated with both PWS and AS.\n    *   **Other syndromic forms of autism and intellectual disability:** The core features of *HERC2* disorders are common in many neurodevelopmental conditions, necessitating broad genetic testing panels.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in HERC2 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "NUTM2B": "NUTM2B Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 23445.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** There is no OMIM entry for the gene NUTM2B itself, but its antisense partner, NUTM2B-AS1, is listed under OMIM 618639.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** NUTM2B is primarily associated with specific cancers through gene fusions, not as a standalone pathogenic gene. The main associations are Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney (CCSK) and high-grade Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma (ESS).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The role of *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusions in causing high-grade ESS and CCSK is well-established, suggesting a definitive clinical significance for the fusion event in the context of somatic cancer genetics.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Disease associations are due to somatic chromosomal translocations, specifically t(10;17)(q22;p13), leading to fusion genes. There is no evidence of germline inheritance for NUTM2B-related disorders, although its antisense transcript, *NUTM2B-AS1*, has been linked to an autosomal dominant myopathy.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics for NUTM2B are pLI = 0.00, LOEUF = 1.32, pRec = 0.76, and pNull = 0.24.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The very low pLI score (<0.9) and high LOEUF score indicate that NUTM2B is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. This suggests that haploinsufficiency of this gene is not a common disease mechanism.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Pathogenicity is not associated with conventional germline variants (missense, nonsense, etc.). Instead, it is driven by somatic chromosomal rearrangements that create oncogenic fusion proteins, such as *YWHAE-NUTM2B*.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As NUTM2B's role is in specific somatic cancers, HPO terms describe the tumors and their features rather than a multi-systemic germline disorder.\n    *   Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (Orphanet:457246).\n    *   Endometrial stromal sarcoma (Orphanet:213711).\n    *   HP:0030093 - Sarcoma.\n    *   HP:0002857 - Renal neoplasm.\n    *   HP:0000107 - Renal tumor.\n    *   HP:0012119 - High grade endometrial stromal sarcoma.\n    *   HP:0002664 - Neoplasm.\n    *   HP:0000007 - Autosomal dominant inheritance (related to NUTM2B-AS1, not NUTM2B fusions).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0001945 - Fever (Associated with CCSK presentation).\n    *   HP:0002018 - Nausea (Associated with CCSK presentation).\n    *   HP:0001944 - Dehydration (Associated with CCSK presentation).\n    *   HP:0002910 - Abdominal pain.\n    *   HP:0000093 - Hematuria.\n    *   HP:0001903 - Anemia.\n    *   HP:0002716 - Lymphadenopathy.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) with the *YWHAE-NUTM2B/E* fusion typically presents in childhood, often in very young patients. High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma occurs in adults.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Sarcomas involving *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusions are generally considered high-grade and clinically aggressive.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** The key variant class is a chromosomal translocation, t(10;17)(q22;p13), which creates a *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusion gene. This specific fusion is strongly correlated with high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma and clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The fusion joins the *YWHAE* gene, which encodes a 14-3-3 protein, with *NUTM2B*. The resulting fusion protein is oncogenic, driving the development of these specific aggressive sarcomas.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between the *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusion and the diagnosis of high-grade ESS and a subset of CCSK is strong. It is considered a defining molecular feature for these tumor types.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   t(10;17)(q22;p13) creating *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusion \u2192 High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma.\n    *   t(10;17)(q22;p13) creating *YWHAE-NUTM2B/E* fusion \u2192 Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.\n    *   *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusions are also found in some infantile soft tissue undifferentiated round cell sarcomas.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **Characterized Pathogenic Variants:** Pathogenicity is defined by somatic fusion events, not germline rsIDs. ClinVar does not list specific pathogenic variants for NUTM2B itself but for related entities.\n    *   **Variant:** *YWHAE-NUTM2B* gene fusion (from t(10;17)(q22;p13)).\n    *   **Significance:** Pathogenic (Somatic).\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma, Clear cell sarcoma of kidney, Infantile soft tissue undifferentiated round cell sarcoma.\n    *   **AF:** Not applicable (somatic variant).\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** The *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusion transcript is the variant with the most robust evidence, serving as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for specific sarcomas. It is mutually exclusive with *BCOR* internal tandem duplications in CCSK, indicating distinct molecular pathways.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** NUTM2B shows broad but generally low levels of expression across many tissues. Tissues with notable expression include nerve, testis, and thyroid. There is no standout expression pattern that directly explains its specific involvement in kidney and uterine sarcomas.\n*   **Tissue-specific Phenotypes Expected:** The phenotypes (sarcomas) arise in the kidney and uterus, where the somatic translocation occurs, rather than being predicted by the normal expression pattern of the native gene.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** While detailed developmental expression data is limited, the occurrence of CCSK in infants and young children suggests a role for the fusion oncogene in early life.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The function of the native NUTM2B protein is not well characterized.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is a gain-of-function for the resulting fusion protein. The YWHAE-NUTM2B oncoprotein drives tumorigenesis.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The YWHAE (14-3-3) portion of the fusion protein is involved in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. The fusion leads to aberrant signaling, resulting in uncontrolled cell growth and the development of high-grade sarcoma. The fusion has been shown to relieve repression of Ets transcription factors like *ETV1* and *ETV4*.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The fusion protein's interactions, driven by the 14-3-3 domain, are critical to its oncogenic activity.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusion is found in a significant subset of CCSK and is the defining feature of high-grade ESS. It is mutually exclusive with other key drivers like *BCOR* ITD in CCSK, making it a critical diagnostic marker.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for the *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusion is performed for the differential diagnosis of pediatric renal tumors and uterine sarcomas. It helps to classify tumors and distinguish high-grade ESS from other types.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identifying the *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusion confirms a diagnosis of a clinically aggressive sarcoma, which informs prognosis and may guide treatment decisions toward more aggressive therapies.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Since the pathogenic fusions are somatic events confined to the tumor, they are not heritable. Genetic counseling should focus on explaining the nature of the acquired genetic change in the tumor and the lack of risk to family members.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 26542179, 2016:** Gooskens SL, et al. This study investigated the clinical phenotype of CCSK with the *YWHAE-NUTM2B/E* fusion and found these patients were often young with low tumor volumes but did not have Stage I disease, failing to define a unique clinical phenotype distinct from other CCSKs.\n*   **PMID: 22456610, 2012:** Lee CH, et al. Landmark paper establishing that *YWHAE-FAM22* (now *YWHAE-NUTM2B*) fusions define a distinct group of high-grade, clinically aggressive endometrial stromal sarcomas.\n*   **PMID: 26627674, 2016:** Kao YC, et al. Reported recurrent *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusions in soft tissue undifferentiated round cell sarcomas of infancy, linking the genetic signature of CCSK to a soft tissue counterpart.\n*   **PMID: 26585802, 2016:** Karlsson J, et al. Showed that *YWHAE-NUTM2B/E* fusions and *BCOR* internal tandem duplications are mutually exclusive events in CCSK, highlighting distinct pathogenetic pathways.\n*   **PMID: 36775628, 2023:** Odate S, et al. A study that links CGG repeat expansion in *NUTM2B-AS1* (the antisense transcript) to oculopharyngodistal myopathy, a separate neurological disease not involving fusions of the *NUTM2B* gene itself.\n*   **PMID: 26542179, 2015:** Gooskens SL, et al. A large descriptive study that aimed to define the clinical phenotype of t(10;17)(q22;p13) positive CCSK, noting it's the sole recurrent genetic aberration identified in these tumors.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   *YWHAE-NUTM2B* gene fusion \u2192 HP:0012119 (High grade endometrial stromal sarcoma).\n    *   *YWHAE-NUTM2B* gene fusion \u2192 HP:0002857 (Renal neoplasm) and more specifically, Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The presence of a renal mass in a young child or a high-grade uterine sarcoma in an adult should prompt molecular testing for a *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusion.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** In pediatric renal tumors, the primary differential for CCSK is Wilms tumor. In infantile soft tissue sarcomas, the differential includes other undifferentiated round cell sarcomas. The presence of the *YWHAE-NUTM2B* fusion distinguishes these entities from others that may have different genetic drivers, such as *BCOR* ITD.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in NUTM2B (1/1):\nN/A.

One report described a patient with features of Blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), soft palate cleft, and microcephaly.\n- **Clinical Significance Level**: The level of evidence for disease association is developing, with several case reports linking variants to specific phenotypes.\n- **Inheritance Patterns**: An autosomal recessive inheritance pattern has been observed in patients with primary ovarian insufficiency.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n- **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI score of 1.00, suggesting extreme intolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction (LOEUF) is low, indicating strong constraint against LoF variants.\n- **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The high pLI and low LOEUF scores indicate that *MRPL22* is highly intolerant to protein-truncating variants, and such variants are likely to be pathogenic.\n- **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Based on constraint scores and case reports, loss-of-function variants (such as nonsense and frameshift) and deleterious missense variants are most likely to be pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n- **Primary HPO terms**:\n    - Primary ovarian insufficiency (HP:0008209)\n    - Amenorrhea (HP:0000141)\n    - Microcephaly (HP:0000252)\n    - Blepharophimosis (HP:0000581)\n    - Ptosis (HP:0000508)\n    - Epicanthus inversus (HP:0000537)\n    - Cleft palate (HP:0000175)\n- **Secondary HPO terms**:\n    - Delayed skeletal maturation (HP:0002750)\n    - Intrauterine growth retardation (HP:0001511)\n    - Craniofacial dysmorphism (HP:0001999)\n    - Developmental delay (HP:0001263)\n- **Age of Onset Patterns**: Phenotypes can manifest from the pre-pubertal period to adolescence.

A homozygous mutation was also identified in a patient with a more complex syndromic presentation including craniofacial anomalies.\n- **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: The identified missense mutations associated with primary ovarian insufficiency are located in highly conserved residues, suggesting their critical role in protein function.\n- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: There appears to be a notable genotype-phenotype correlation, where certain missense variants result in a less severe phenotype (primary ovarian insufficiency) compared to other mutations that may cause severe mitochondrial disease.\n- **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes**:\n    - Homozygous missense variants c.404G>A (p.R135Q) and c.605G>A (p.R202H) are associated with primary ovarian insufficiency in adolescents.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n- **Up to 15 well-characterized pathogenic variants**:\n    - c.404G>A (p.Arg135Gln) / Likely pathogenic / Primary ovarian insufficiency (HP:0008209)\n    - c.605G>A (p.Arg202His) / Likely pathogenic / Primary ovarian insufficiency (HP:0008209)\n- **Variants with strongest phenotype evidence**: The homozygous missense variants p.Arg135Gln and p.Arg202His have strong evidence linking them to primary ovarian insufficiency, as they were identified in four females from two independent families.\n- **Novel variants from recent case reports**: The variants causing primary ovarian insufficiency were reported as novel genetic causes.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest expressing tissues (GTEx TPM) and clinical correlation**: *MRPL22* is broadly expressed, with higher levels observed in tissues with high metabolic activity. The Bgee database notes high expression in the heart (left ventricle, right auricle, apex), colon mucosa, and adrenal glands. This broad expression is consistent with its role in fundamental mitochondrial processes.\n- **Tissue-specific phenotypes expected**: The link to primary ovarian insufficiency suggests a tissue-specific vulnerability or a non-bioenergetic mitochondrial defect, as broader mitochondrial dysfunction was not detected in patient fibroblasts. A *Drosophila* model showed that deficiency in germ cells, but not ovarian somatic cells, caused infertility, supporting a cell-autonomous role in germ cell development.\n- **Expression during development and age-related phenotypes**: *MRPL22* is essential for early embryonic development, as homozygous knockout in mice is lethal before gastrulation. It is expressed in human fetal tissues between 10 and 20 weeks of gestation.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal gene function in one sentence**: MRPL22 is a nuclear-encoded protein that is a component of the large 39S subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome, essential for protein synthesis within the mitochondria.\n- **Disease mechanism**: The observed autosomal recessive inheritance pattern for primary ovarian insufficiency suggests a loss-of-function mechanism. The high constraint against LoF variants further supports haploinsufficiency as a likely mechanism for dominant disorders, should any be identified.\n- **Cellular/molecular pathways disrupted \u2192 phenotype consequences**: Disruption of MRPL22 impairs mitochondrial translation, which is critical for the synthesis of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation. This can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which has tissue-specific consequences, such as impacting germ cell development and leading to primary ovarian insufficiency.\n- **Protein-protein interactions relevant to phenotype**: As a component of the mitoribosome, MRPL22 interacts with other mitochondrial ribosomal proteins and rRNAs to facilitate translation.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- **PMID: 29566152, Year: 2018**: Established the first link between homozygous missense mutations in *MRPS22* (an alias/related gene) and primary ovarian insufficiency, highlighting a less severe phenotype than previously expected for mitochondrial ribosomal protein defects.\n- **PMID: 33227914, Year: 2020**: A review that mentions a homozygous mutation in *MRPS22* was found in a patient with Blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES), soft palate cleft, and microcephaly, expanding the phenotypic spectrum.\n- **PMID: 28509873, Year: 2017**: A study in mice demonstrating that homozygous knockout of *Mrpl22* results in embryonic lethality, underscoring its critical role in early development.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n- **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**:\n    - Homozygous missense variants (p.Arg135Gln, p.Arg202His) are strongly associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (HP:0008209) and amenorrhea (HP:0000141).\n- **Phenotype red flags**: The presentation of primary ovarian insufficiency in an adolescent, especially in the context of consanguinity, should raise suspicion for pathogenic variants in *MRPL22*. The combination of craniofacial abnormalities with developmental delay could also be a significant indicator.\n- **Differential diagnosis considerations**: The phenotype of primary ovarian insufficiency can be caused by mutations in various other genes involved in hormonal signaling and folliculogenesis. The more severe syndromic presentation overlaps with other mitochondrial disorders.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in MRPL22 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "TAS2R43": "TAS2R43 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 18875.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 612668.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** No definitive monogenic disease associations have been established. Variants are primarily associated with sensory traits like taste perception.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance for disease is currently unknown or not established; it is primarily studied for its role in sensory perception and population-based traits.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Not applicable for a Mendelian disease; trait associations are studied in population cohorts.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The search did not yield specific gnomAD constraint metric values for TAS2R43.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A high pLI (e.g., \u2265 0.9) or a low LOEUF (e.g., < 0.35) score would indicate that a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variants, making such variants more likely to be pathogenic. Given the functional redundancy among bitter taste receptors, TAS2R43 is not expected to be highly constrained against LoF variation.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For genes intolerant to LoF, pathogenic variants are typically protein-truncating (nonsense, frameshift) or critical missense variants. For TAS2R43, \"pathogenicity\" relates to altered function (e.g., taste perception), with missense variants being well-studied.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are consistently associated with variants in TAS2R43 in the context of clinical disease. Phenotypes are related to sensory perception rather than pathology.\n*   **Associated Traits (not HPO-coded):**\n    *   Variation in coffee liking.\n    *   Altered perception of caffeine bitterness.\n    *   Sensitivity to the bitterness of the artificial sweetener saccharin.\n    *   Potential association with susceptibility to Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN).\n    *   Potential association with phantogeusia (phantom taste).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Missense variants:** Function-altering missense variants are associated with significant changes in the perception of bitter compounds like caffeine.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Strong correlation exists between specific missense variants and caffeine taste perception.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   **H212R (rs71443637):** This variant, which reduces in vitro protein activity, is significantly associated with coffee liking and mediates the perception of caffeine bitterness. The functional (wild-type) allele is associated with higher coffee liking.\n    *   **W35S (rs68157013):** This functional variant largely diminishes protein activity in vitro and is associated with coffee liking, but a direct link to caffeine perception was not established in one study.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No variants with a ClinVar significance of \"pathogenic\" for a Mendelian disease were identified in the search results. Variants are associated with traits and have a \"benign\" or \"likely benign\" classification in the context of disease.\n*   **Key Trait-Associated Variants:**\n    *   **rs71443637 (H212R):** Associated with coffee liking and caffeine bitterness perception.\n    *   **rs68157013 (W35S):** Associated with coffee liking; causes diminished protein function.\n    *   **rs35720106 (synonymous):** Associated with coffee liking, likely due to strong linkage disequilibrium with rs71443637.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues:** Expression has been noted in the testicle, muscle of the thigh, tonsil, and apex of the heart.\n*   **Extra-oral Expression:** Like other TAS2Rs, TAS2R43 is expressed outside the oral cavity, including in airway epithelial cells, the gastrointestinal tract, and the intestine, suggesting roles beyond taste perception.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Airway cells:** In airway cilia, binding of bitter compounds increases intracellular calcium and ciliary beat frequency, suggesting a role in innate immune defense.\n    *   **Intestine:** Expression in the gut suggests a role in modulating innate immune responses and metabolic regulation.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** TAS2R43 is a G protein-coupled receptor that detects bitter compounds, including caffeine and certain artificial sweeteners.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Not associated with a classic disease mechanism. Altered function due to genetic variants leads to changes in sensory perception and may influence dietary choices or susceptibility to environmental toxins. Loss-of-function may be compensated by other redundant bitter taste receptors.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** The receptor signals through a G protein (gustducin), activating phospholipase C beta 2 (PLCB2), which leads to an increase in intracellular calcium and activation of the TRPM5 ion channel, culminating in neurotransmitter release or cellular responses like increased ciliary beat.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Zero; this gene is not currently used for the diagnosis of any Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Genetic testing is performed in a research context to study taste perception, food preference, and potential associations with complex traits or diseases like Balkan Endemic Nephropathy.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present. Understanding an individual's genotype could have future applications in personalized nutrition or pharmacogenomics.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would focus on the gene's role in influencing traits like taste and food preferences, not on disease risk, and would emphasize the minor contribution of this single gene to complex behaviors.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Pirastu N, et al. (2014) PLoS ONE.** Established a significant correlation between functional variants in *TAS2R43* (W35S and H212R) and coffee liking in a large cohort, linking the H212R variant specifically to caffeine bitterness perception. (PMID: not available in search, study published in PLoS ONE)\n*   **Wooding SP, et al. (2010) American Journal of Human Genetics.** Reported an association between a *TAS2R43* mutational polymorphism and susceptibility to Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN), suggesting a role for toxin responses in health risks. (PMID: not available in search, mentioned in NCBI Gene summary)\n*   **Pronin AN, et al. (2007) Chemical Senses.** Showed that TAS2R43 and the related TAS2R44 function as receptors for the artificial sweeteners saccharin and acesulfame K. (PMID: not available in search, mentioned in NCBI Gene summary)\n*   **Sandel M, et al. (2010) Journal of Neurophysiology.** Demonstrated that TAS2R43 responds to a range of bitter compounds, but its responses are often redundant with other bitter taste receptors. (PMID: not available in search, reference is to Meyerhof et al., 2010)\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** No high-confidence HPO-variant associations for clinical disease exist. High-confidence *trait*-variant associations include:\n    *   **rs71443637 (H212R)** \u2192 Altered caffeine bitterness perception and coffee liking.\n    *   **rs68157013 (W35S)** \u2192 Diminished receptor function and association with coffee liking.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are no \"red flag\" HPO terms. A patient report of significantly altered bitter taste perception (especially for caffeine or saccharin) could suggest investigating variants in the *TAS2R* gene family, including *TAS2R43*.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Phenotypes related to altered bitter taste would involve considering variants in the other ~24 human *TAS2R* genes, as many show functional overlap and respond to multiple bitter compounds.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in TAS2R43 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "SLC16A6": "SLC16A6 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: SLC16A6 (MCT6)**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:10926\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 603765\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While some databases associate the gene with broader categories, current evidence most strongly links *SLC16A6* variants to variation in human height as a quantitative trait locus. There is no definitive monogenic disease associated with this gene.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association with human height is based on population-level genetic studies. Its role in monogenic disease is not established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Not applicable for a monogenic disease context; variants contribute to a complex trait (height).\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI:** 0.00 (gnomAD v2.1.1)\n*   **LOEUF:** 1.13 (gnomAD v2.1.1)\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) is very low, and the loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is high. This indicates that the gene is highly tolerant of inactivating variants and is not under strong selection against heterozygous loss-of-function, making it an unlikely candidate for a haploinsufficient disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Currently, no specific variant classes are defined as pathogenic for a monogenic disease. Variants associated with height are found in non-coding (5'-UTR, intron 1) and coding (exon 5) regions.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No HPO terms are definitively associated with pathogenic variants in *SLC16A6* for a Mendelian disorder. The primary associated phenotype is a quantitative trait:\n    *   Tall stature (HP:0000098) - Inferred from population studies showing association with increased adult height.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are currently documented in clinical cases. Zebrafish models with loss-of-function mutations exhibit:\n    *   Hepatic steatosis (HP:0001397) - Observed in zebrafish larvae and adults under specific dietary conditions due to impaired ketone body export from the liver.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The association with height is measured in adults.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable in a monogenic disease context. The effect on height is a statistical contribution, not a spectrum of disease severity.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Loss-of-function in zebrafish models leads to increased body length. In humans, variants in the 5'-UTR, first intron, and a missense variant in the fifth exon are significantly associated with increased adult height.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No specific domain-phenotype correlations have been established.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between certain *SLC16A6* variants and human height is statistically significant in large population cohorts, but this does not represent a deterministic cause for a Mendelian disorder.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No well-characterized pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in *SLC16A6* are listed in ClinVar as causative for a monogenic disease. The gene's primary association is with the complex trait of height.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** Population genetics data suggest primary expression sites relevant to its phenotype are the liver, brain, and endocrine pancreas. The GTEx portal shows expression across many tissues, with notable levels in the testis, skeletal muscle, and heart.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Liver-specific dysfunction in zebrafish models causes hepatic steatosis due to an inability to export ketone bodies. The effect on height is likely regulated by its function in several tissues.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The role of expression during development has not been fully elucidated, but its impact on adult height suggests a role during growth periods.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *SLC16A6* encodes a proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter that moves substrates such as ketone bodies across the plasma membrane.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism appears to be related to loss-of-function. In zebrafish, complete loss of the protein promotes linear growth.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of ketone body metabolism is the primary known pathway effect. In zebrafish liver, impaired export of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate diverts ketogenic carbons into triacylglycerol synthesis, causing steatosis. The precise pathway linking monocarboxylate transport to human height is not yet understood.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Monocarboxylate transporters can require an ancillary protein, such as basigin, for proper localization and function.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Zero, as *SLC16A6* is not currently associated with a Mendelian disease for which clinical testing is performed.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is not common in a clinical diagnostic setting. It is primarily analyzed in a research context for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits like height.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counsel should emphasize that variants in this gene are considered modifiers of complex traits (like height) and are not known to cause a single-gene disorder. Distinguishing this from other *SLC16A* family members that do cause severe Mendelian diseases (e.g., *SLC16A2* and Allan-Herndon-Dudley Syndrome) is critical.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 30692942, 2019:** Established the primary link between *SLC16A6* and adult height through studies in both zebrafish and humans, demonstrating that loss of function in zebrafish promotes increased length.\n*   **PMID: 32445851, 2020:** A bioinformatic analysis of the *SLC16A* family in pancreatic cancer found that *SLC16A6* was generally expressed at lower levels in tumors compared to normal tissues.\n*   **PMID: 29596541, 2018:** Described the function of related monocarboxylate transporters and the disease mechanisms associated with other members of the SLC16 family, providing context for the gene family.\n*   **NCBI Gene ID: 9120 (updated 2025):** The gene summary notes that genetic variants in *SLC16A6* of the ketone body metabolic pathway may predict cutaneous melanoma-specific survival.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** At present, the only association is between certain common and non-coding variants and the quantitative trait of increased adult height, which could be mapped inferentially to Tall stature (HP:0000098). There are no high-confidence associations for a monogenic disorder.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are no \"red flag\" HPO terms that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in *SLC16A6*. Its contribution to height is part of normal variation and not indicative of a syndromic overgrowth disorder.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Because there is no defined *SLC16A6*-related disease, it would not typically be part of a differential diagnosis. It is crucial to differentiate from other genes in the same family, such as *SLC16A1*, which causes recurrent ketoacidosis, and *SLC16A2*, which causes Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome characterized by severe psychomotor disability (Global developmental delay, HP:0001263; Generalized hypotonia, HP:0001290).\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in SLC16A6 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "CIC": "CIC Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 14214.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 612082.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** CIC-related neurodevelopmental disorder, also referred to as Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Autosomal Dominant 45 (MRD45). Somatic mutations are associated with certain cancers, including oligodendrogliomas and T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between germline *CIC* variants and neurodevelopmental disorders is well-established, though the full phenotypic spectrum is still being defined.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Autosomal dominant inheritance is the typical pattern. The majority of reported pathogenic variants are de novo, but inherited cases from an affected or mosaic parent have been documented.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF:** The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score is 1.0. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction (LOEUF) is 0.25.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The high pLI and low LOEUF scores indicate that *CIC* is extremely intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. This strong constraint suggests that heterozygous LoF variants are likely to be pathogenic.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Protein-truncating variants (e.g., nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants) are the most frequently reported pathogenic class. Missense variants have also been identified as pathogenic, some with functional evidence demonstrating a loss of function.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Intellectual disability (HP:0001249).\n    *   Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   Behavioral abnormality (HP:0000708).\n    *   Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0100712).\n    *   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (HP:0007018).\n    *   Hypotonia (HP:0001252).\n    *   MRI abnormalities (e.g., Abnormality of the cerebral white matter, HP:0002500).\n    *   Cerebral folate deficiency.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Hyperactivity (HP:0000752).\n    *   Developmental regression (HP:0002376).\n    *   Generalized myoclonic seizures (HP:0011171).\n    *   Focal-onset seizure (HP:0007359).\n    *   Spina bifida (related to neural tube defects).\n    *   Dystonia.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically in infancy or early childhood, with presentations of developmental delay or seizures.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** There is significant phenotypic variability, ranging from individuals with isolated epilepsy to those with severe neurodevelopmental disorders encompassing intellectual disability, autism, and refractory epilepsy.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Both protein-truncating and missense variants lead to a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. There is no clear, consistent correlation between variant type and phenotype severity.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Pathogenic variants are distributed across various protein domains, and a clear domain-specific correlation has not yet been established. Variants within the HMG-box DNA binding domain have been implicated in both neurodevelopmental disorders and cancers.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is currently considered weak to moderate due to significant variable expressivity, even within families sharing the same pathogenic variant.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   The c.1057C>T (p.Arg353*) variant was identified in a patient with cerebral folate deficiency.\n    *   A c.1526del (p.Pro509Hisfs*14) variant was found in a father and daughter with isolated epilepsy, expanding the phenotype to include non-syndromic presentations.\n    *   A c.2694dupC (p.K899Qfs*32) variant was seen in three family members with variable neurodevelopmental impairments, including absence seizures and autism spectrum disorder.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **NM_015125.3:c.673C>T (p.Gln225Ter):** Pathogenic, associated with neurodevelopmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures.\n*   **NM_015125.3:c.1057C>T (p.Arg353*):** Pathogenic, linked to cerebral folate deficiency and neurodevelopmental abnormalities.\n*   **NM_001304815.1:c.1100dup (p.Pro368AlafsTer16):** Pathogenic, found in a patient with speech delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder; this variant is specific to the long CIC isoform.\n*   **NM_015125.4:c.1526del (p.Pro509Hisfs*14):** Likely pathogenic, associated with isolated epilepsy without other major neurodevelopmental issues.\n*   **NM_015125.3:c.683G>A (p.Arg228Gln):** A missense variant associated with speech delay and pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), showing partial loss of function.\n*   **NM_015125.3:c.2694dupC (p.K899Qfs*32):** Pathogenic, reported in a family with variable neurodevelopmental impairment, including absence seizures and autism spectrum disorder.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** *CIC* is widely expressed, with particularly high expression in various brain regions, including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. This high brain expression aligns with the primary neurological phenotypes observed in patients.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The predominant phenotypes are neurological, consistent with high central nervous system expression. Somatic mutations in specific tissues can lead to cancers like oligodendroglioma and T-ALL.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** *CIC* is highly expressed in the developing brain and plays a role in neurogenesis. This developmental role explains why pathogenic variants manifest as congenital or early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function in one sentence:** CIC is a transcriptional repressor that is a key component of the ATXN1-CIC complex, which regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and development downstream of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway.\n*   **Disease Mechanism: Haploinsufficiency, Dominant-Negative, Gain-of-Function:** The primary disease mechanism for the neurodevelopmental disorder is haploinsufficiency, resulting from loss-of-function variants. There is currently no evidence for a dominant-negative or gain-of-function mechanism in the germline context.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **RAS-MAPK Pathway:** Loss of CIC-mediated repression leads to derepression of MAPK pathway target genes (e.g., *ETV1, ETV4, ETV5*), promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation and impacting neuronal function.\n    *   **Folate Metabolism:** CIC regulates the expression of the folate receptor gene *FOLR1*; loss of CIC function can downregulate *FOLR1*, leading to cerebral folate deficiency and contributing to neurodevelopmental defects.\n    *   **ATXN1-CIC Complex:** Disruption of this complex impairs normal brain development and can lead to behavioral deficits.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction with ATXN1 is critical for forming the repressor complex. CIC also interacts with the SIN3-HDAC complex to mediate transcriptional repression via histone deacetylation.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** *CIC* variants are a recognized cause of monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders, including epilepsy and intellectual disability. They are identified through broad genetic testing panels, exome, and genome sequencing for these conditions.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is indicated for individuals with unexplained developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and/or epilepsy, particularly childhood-onset forms.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** A genetic diagnosis can provide prognostic information and guide management, such as the selection of anti-seizure medications and screening for associated features like cerebral folate deficiency. In some cases, it may inform decisions about weaning anti-epileptic drugs.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address autosomal dominant inheritance, the high likelihood of de novo occurrence, and the significant phenotypic variability, including the possibility of milder or isolated phenotypes in affected family members.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Ruiz et al., *Genes (Basel)*, 2024 (PMID: 39611425):** Reported a novel paternally inherited truncating variant causing isolated epilepsy, expanding the known phenotype of *CIC*-related disorders beyond complex neurodevelopmental syndromes.\n*   **Sharma et al., *Hum Mutat*, 2022 (PMID: 35165976):** Described novel *CIC* variants, including one specific to the long isoform, and provided functional evidence that partial loss of CIC repressor activity is a pathogenic mechanism for neurodevelopmental phenotypes.\n*   **Kishnani et al., *Neuropediatrics*, 2021 (PMID: 34116524):** Presented a three-generation family with a pathogenic *CIC* variant showing significant intrafamilial phenotypic variability, highlighting the role of potential genetic modifiers.\n*   **Cao et al., *J Med Genet*, 2021 (PMID: 32820034):** Established a novel link between *CIC* loss-of-function variants and cerebral folate deficiency through the downregulation of *FOLR1* expression.\n*   **Weissmann et al., *Cancer Res*, 2018 (PMID: 29875149):** Elucidated the molecular mechanism of CIC as a transcriptional repressor of MAPK pathway genes via histone deacetylation, providing a link between its loss and tumorigenesis.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   Heterozygous protein-truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift) are strongly associated with a core phenotype of **Intellectual disability (HP:0001249)**, **Global developmental delay (HP:0001263)**, and **Seizures (HP:0001250)**.\n    *   Loss-of-function variants, including some missense variants, can be associated with **Cerebral folate deficiency (HP:0100523)** due to the dysregulation of *FOLR1*.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:**\n    *   The combination of intellectual disability, seizures, and behavioral abnormalities (especially ADHD or autism spectrum disorder) is highly suggestive of a pathogenic *CIC* variant.\n    *   Unexplained cerebral folate deficiency should prompt consideration of *CIC* sequencing, even in the absence of variants in known CFD genes.\n    *   The presence of even isolated, unexplained epilepsy may warrant *CIC* testing, as milder phenotypes are now recognized.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:**\n    *   The phenotype overlaps with numerous other syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disability and epilepsy disorders.\n    *   Given its role in the MAPK pathway, there can be some phenotypic overlap with RASopathies, although the classic dysmorphic features of many RASopathies are not typically prominent in *CIC*-related disorders.\n    *   For patients with neural tube defects, consider other genes in the folate pathway and planar cell polarity pathway, as CIC has been shown to influence these processes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in CIC (1/1):\nN/A.

        "PNPLA7": "PNPLA7 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 24768.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 612122.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While directly causative links to a specific Mendelian disease are not yet firmly established, PNPLA7 has been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Axonal, Type 2P and Chanarin-Dorfman Syndrome in some databases. Studies have also investigated its association with susceptibility to menstrual disorders.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of PNPLA7 variants is largely under investigation, with most variants in ClinVar classified as \"Uncertain Significance\".\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Given the early stage of research, definitive inheritance patterns for PNPLA7-related disorders in humans are not well-defined.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** PNPLA7 has a low probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score, suggesting it is not highly constrained against protein-truncating variants. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) score is a more continuous metric of intolerance to inactivation. Specific numeric values for pLI and LOEUF for PNPLA7 from gnomAD are needed for a full interpretation.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A low pLI score (closer to 0) suggests that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in PNPLA7 may be tolerated in the general population. Genes with high pLI scores (\u2265 0.9) are considered extremely intolerant to such variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While data is limited, understanding the gene's function suggests that missense or LoF variants disrupting the catalytic patatin-like phospholipase domain could be pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As definitive disease associations are still emerging, a ranked list of HPO terms is not yet available. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for clinical abnormalities.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Based on mouse model studies, potential phenotypes could relate to growth retardation, muscle weakness, and metabolic abnormalities.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Information on the age of onset for PNPLA7-related phenotypes in humans is not currently available.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The spectrum of severity for potential PNPLA7-related phenotypes in humans has not been characterized.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific correlations between variant classes and human phenotypes are not yet established.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Mutations within the C-terminal patatin-like phospholipase domain, which contains the catalytic site, would be most likely to lead to a loss of function and associated phenotypes. The N-terminal region is responsible for targeting the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlations for PNPLA7 is currently considered weak due to a lack of established disease associations in humans.\n*   **Examples:** A polymorphism (rs11137410) in PNPLA7 has been studied for a possible association with menstrual disorders in women with type O blood.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   Currently, there are no well-characterized pathogenic variants in PNPLA7 with established phenotype associations in ClinVar. The database primarily lists variants of uncertain significance.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** PNPLA7 shows expression in a variety of tissues. According to the Human Protein Atlas, it is expressed in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and testis. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides detailed data on tissue-specific gene expression.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Based on high expression in metabolically active tissues, phenotypes could involve muscle weakness, metabolic syndrome-like features, or reproductive issues. Mouse models show growth retardation, kyphosis, muscle weakness, and reduced fat stores.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Information on developmental expression is limited. Mouse models show post-weaning growth retardation, suggesting a role in post-natal metabolism and growth.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** PNPLA7 is a lysophospholipase that hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine to generate glycerophosphocholine, a precursor for free choline, which is crucial for hepatic choline and methionine metabolism.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The likely disease mechanism for loss-of-function variants would be haploinsufficiency, leading to reduced enzyme activity and disruption of lipid metabolism.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Deficiency in PNPLA7 impairs the mobilization of choline from membrane phospholipids, leading to a state reminiscent of methionine insufficiency. This can disrupt hepatic lipid metabolism and potentially impact epigenetic regulation. It also plays a role in macrophage activation by modulating SIRT1/NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK pathways.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** PNPLA7 interacts with lipid droplets through its catalytic domain. In the liver, it functions in a common metabolic pathway with PNPLA8.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for PNPLA7 in clinical cohorts is currently unknown, as it is not typically included in standard gene panels for specific disorders.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for PNPLA7 is currently performed on a research basis, often in the context of studies on lipid metabolism or in cases with undefined neurological or metabolic phenotypes where related genes are being investigated.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** At present, there are no specific clinical management guidelines related to PNPLA7 variants.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling would involve discussing the uncertainty of findings, the lack of established disease correlation, and the potential for future research to clarify the role of PNPLA7 in disease.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Miyashita, et al. (2023):** PMID: 36875883. This review highlighted the role of PNPLA7 in controlling hepatic choline and methionine metabolism, with deficiency in mice leading to phenotypes resembling methionine shortage.\n*   **Heier, et al. (2017):** PMID: 28974635. This study characterized PNPLA7 as an ER-anchored lysophosphatidylcholine hydrolase and detailed the function of its different protein domains.\n*   **Li, et al. (2022):** PMID: 35914902. Showed that PNPLA7 suppresses M1 macrophage polarization by modulating SIRT1/NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK-dependent pathways.\n*   **Ma, et al. (2018):** PMID: 29849925. This study investigated the correlation between PNPLA7 gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to menstrual disorders.\n*   **Kaindl, et al. (2008):** While not directly on PNPLA7, research on the related gene PNPLA6 has established links to neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a potential area of investigation for PNPLA7.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Due to the lack of established pathogenic variants and defined disease associations, there are currently no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for PNPLA7.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** Based on mouse model data, a combination of post-weaning growth retardation (HP:0001511), muscle weakness (HP:0001324), kyphosis (HP:0002808), and lipodystrophy (HP:0009125) could be considered red flags warranting investigation of PNPLA7.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The potential phenotypes overlap with disorders caused by mutations in other PNPLA family members, such as PNPLA6 (associated with neurodegeneration) and PNPLA8, as well as disorders of choline and methionine metabolism. The similar phenotypes of Pnpla7 and Pnpla8 knockout mice suggest a common pathway.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PNPLA7 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "CC2D1B": "CC2D1B Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n- **HGNC ID:** 29386.\n- **OMIM Gene ID:** Not available, as no human disease has been definitively linked to this gene alone.\n- **Primary Disease Associations:** While no monogenic disease is established, *CC2D1B* is considered a candidate gene for neurodevelopmental disorders, potentially in a recessive or trans-heterozygous model with its paralog, *CC2D1A*. Mouse models suggest a role in cognitive function.\n- **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of *CC2D1B* variants is currently uncertain.\n- **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Autosomal recessive inheritance is suggested as a potential model based on studies of its paralog *CC2D1A* and mouse models.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n- **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics are not available. However, a low loss-of-function observed/expected (o/e) score indicates intolerance to protein-truncating variation. The specific pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) score is not directly provided, but a score greater than or equal to 0.9 is considered highly intolerant. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) score is recommended over pLI, with lower values indicating greater intolerance.\n- **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A low LOEUF score would suggest that *CC2D1B* is intolerant to loss-of-function variation, making such variants more likely to be pathogenic. This metric helps to identify genes under strong selective pressure.\n- **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Based on general principles, loss-of-function variants (e.g., nonsense, frameshift) in a constrained gene would be the most likely to be pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n- **Primary HPO terms:** As no human disease is directly linked to *CC2D1B*, a definitive list of HPO terms is not available. Based on mouse models, potential phenotypes could relate to cognitive deficits.\n- **Secondary HPO terms:** Not applicable due to the lack of a defined human phenotype.\n- **Age of Onset Patterns:** Based on mouse studies where loss of *Cc2d1b* did not result in neonatal lethality (unlike *Cc2d1a*), any potential human phenotype might manifest postnatally, possibly during childhood development.\n- **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** In mice, the loss of *Cc2d1b* leads to less severe phenotypes than the loss of *Cc2d1a*, suggesting any potential human phenotype might be in the mild to moderate range.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n- **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** There are no established genotype-phenotype correlations for *CC2D1B* in humans.\n- **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The CC2D1B protein contains a C2 domain for membrane lipid binding and DM14 domains for interacting with the ESCRT-III complex. Pathogenic variants in these domains could theoretically disrupt these functions, but specific phenotype correlations are unknown.\n- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable.\n- **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** No specific pathogenic variants in *CC2D1B* have been linked to a human phenotype.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n- No pathogenic variants in *CC2D1B* with established clinical significance and associated phenotypes are reported in ClinVar.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** *CC2D1B* is expressed in various tissues, including the nervous system and skin. Its expression in myelinating cells in both the central and peripheral nervous systems suggests a potential role in myelination. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides a resource to study how genetic variation affects gene expression across different tissues.\n- **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its expression in the brain and its role in myelin formation in mice, pathogenic variants could potentially lead to neurological phenotypes such as cognitive deficits or developmental delay related to myelination.\n- **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Studies in mice show that the combined loss of *Cc2d1a* and *Cc2d1b* is embryonically lethal, indicating an essential role in development. *Cc2d1b* itself plays a role in developmental myelination in the central nervous system.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal Gene Function:** *CC2D1B* functions as a transcription factor that represses the transcription of the serotonin receptor gene 5-HT1A.\n- **Disease Mechanism:** Based on studies of its paralog *CC2D1A* and mouse models, a loss-of-function mechanism, likely through haploinsufficiency or a recessive model, is the most probable disease mechanism.\n- **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The protein is involved in endosomal trafficking through its interaction with the ESCRT-III complex. It also regulates the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. Disruption of these pathways could lead to the observed cognitive phenotypes in mouse models.\n- **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** CC2D1B interacts with the ESCRT-III component Shrub/CHMP4, which is crucial for endosomal trafficking.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n- **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for *CC2D1B* is currently zero, as it is not yet established as a disease-causing gene in humans.\n- **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for *CC2D1B* would likely be considered in individuals with unexplained intellectual disability or developmental delay, particularly if variants in its paralog, *CC2D1A*, have been ruled out.\n- **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are currently no specific clinical actions or management guidelines associated with variants in *CC2D1B*.\n- **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling would involve explaining the uncertain significance of *CC2D1B* variants and the lack of a defined human phenotype. The possibility of recessive or trans-heterozygous inheritance with *CC2D1A* could be discussed.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- **PMID: 29593722, 2018:** This study in mice demonstrated that loss of *Cc2d1b* leads to cognitive deficits in memory acquisition and retention, suggesting it is critical for cognitive development.\n- **PMID: 26720743, 2015:** This paper showed that while loss of *Cc2d1b* in mice has no obvious phenotype, the combined loss with *Cc2d1a* is lethal, indicating partially redundant functions in development and endosomal pathways.\n- **PMID: 34986618, 2022:** This research highlighted the role of *CC2D1B* in developmental myelination in the central nervous system of mice.\n- **PMID: 19423080, 2009:** This publication first identified CC2D1B (as Freud-2) as a repressor for the 5-HT1A receptor gene.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n- **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for *CC2D1B*.\n- **Phenotype red flags:** Based on mouse models, HPO terms related to **intellectual disability (HP:0001249)** and **impaired memory (HP:0002354)** could be considered red flags, warranting investigation of *CC2D1B* in cases where more common genetic causes have been excluded.\n- **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The potential phenotypes associated with *CC2D1B* would overlap significantly with those caused by pathogenic variants in its paralog, *CC2D1A* (OMIM #610055), which causes Intellectual Developmental Disorder, Autosomal Recessive 3 (OMIM #608443).

General gnomAD documentation indicates that LOEUF < 0.6 is a recommended threshold for defining loss-of-function constrained genes in v4.0.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Without specific scores, it is not possible to determine if WASHC2A is intolerant to loss-of-function variation. This metric is crucial for interpreting the potential pathogenicity of newly discovered variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** In the absence of constraint data and known pathogenic variants, the variant classes most likely to be pathogenic cannot be definitively determined. Analysis would follow standard interpretation guidelines, considering the molecular function of the protein.\n\n#### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No comprehensive list of HPO terms linked to WASHC2A variants in humans is available in the search results. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for clinical abnormalities but requires curation for specific genes.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Mouse models (MGI) suggest phenotypes such as \"mortality/aging\" and \"embryo phenotype\".

UniProt notes 1,310 variants from sources including ClinVar and dbSNP, but their clinical significance is largely unknown.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** No variants with strong evidence for causing a specific phenotype have been documented in the search results. DECIPHER lists matching patient variants but does not provide open-access details on the associated phenotypes.\n*   **Novel Variants from Recent Case Reports:** No recent case reports detailing novel pathogenic WASHC2A variants and associated phenotypes were identified in the searches.\n\n#### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx):** WASHC2A shows eQTL evidence in Skin (Sun Exposed, Lower leg), Cells (Transformed fibroblasts), Muscle (Skeletal), and Artery (Tibial). The GTEx project provides a comprehensive resource for studying tissue-specific gene expression and its link to genetic variation.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its expression pattern, variants in WASHC2A could potentially manifest in phenotypes affecting the skin, muscle, or vascular systems, but this is speculative.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Studies have noted tissue-specific changes in gene expression during human fetal development and aging, though specific data for WASHC2A was not detailed.\n\n#### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** WASHC2A is a component of the WASH core complex, which regulates actin polymerization at the surface of endosomes, playing a key role in endosomal sorting and trafficking of proteins.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism for WASHC2A variants has not been elucidated. Given its role in a protein complex, haploinsufficiency is a potential mechanism for loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The gene is involved in endocytosis and retrograde transport from the endosome to the Golgi. Disruption could impair the recycling of critical surface proteins, such as the glucose transporter GLUT1, and other cargo handled by the SNX27-retromer pathway.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** WASHC2A recruits the WASH complex to endosomes by binding to phospholipids and the retromer component VPS35. It also interacts with Ku to localize to DNA double-strand break sites, suggesting a role in DNA repair.\n\n#### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for WASHC2A sequencing in clinical cohorts with developmental disorders or other phenotypes is unknown.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for this gene would likely occur as part of large gene panels or exome/genome sequencing for individuals with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders or phenotypes overlapping with its known functions (e.g., endosomal trafficking disorders).\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no established clinical actionability guidelines or specific management protocols related to WASHC2A variants.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would be challenging due to the uncertain clinical significance of variants. The lack of a defined disease association and inheritance pattern must be communicated.\n\n#### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Wang T, et al.

        "KIF17": "KIF17 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: KIF17**\n\n#### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 19167.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 605037.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:**\n    *   Microphthalmia/Anophthalmia/Coloboma (MAC) spectrum.\n    *   Potential association with schizophrenia and other neurodevelopmental phenotypes.\n    *   Potential association with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:**\n    *   Moderate to strong for structural eye disease (MAC spectrum) with biallelic variants.\n    *   Limited/conflicting for schizophrenia; a de novo truncating mutation has been reported, but a GenCC submitter classifies the relationship as \"No Known Disease Relationship\".\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:**\n    *   Autosomal recessive for MAC spectrum phenotypes, with compound heterozygous variants identified.\n\n#### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Based on gnomAD v2.1.1, KIF17 has a pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) score of 0.00 and a LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) score of 1.07.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The gnomAD constraint scores indicate that KIF17 is tolerant to loss-of-function variation in the general population. This lack of constraint can complicate the interpretation of novel loss-of-function variants, as haploinsufficiency is not a well-established disease mechanism.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:**\n    *   Biallelic missense variants have been associated with autosomal recessive structural eye disease.\n    *   De novo truncating mutations have been suggested in dominant neurodevelopmental disorders like schizophrenia, though evidence is limited.\n\n#### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**\n    *   Coloboma (MONDO:0001476).\n    *   Microphthalmia (MONDO:0021129).\n    *   Developmental delay, mild.\n    *   Posterior coloboma.\n    *   Lens luxation.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**\n    *   Schizophrenia (MONDO:0005090).\n    *   Dementia with Lewy bodies.\n    *   Abnormal behavior.\n    *   Cerebellar hypoplasia (inferred from mouse models).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:**\n    *   Congenital for ocular phenotypes (MAC spectrum).\n    *   Adult-onset for neurodegenerative conditions like DLB.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:**\n    *   Ocular phenotypes can be severe, leading to significant visual impairment.\n    *   Associated neurodevelopmental delay has been described as mild.\n\n#### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   Biallelic missense variants (compound heterozygous) are associated with congenital microphthalmia and coloboma.\n    *   A rare de novo truncating mutation was identified in a patient with schizophrenia, suggesting a possible link for monoallelic loss-of-function variants to neuropsychiatric disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:**\n    *   Pathogenic missense variants p.Arg419Trp and p.Arg852Cys associated with MAC spectrum disease fall within the coiled-coil (CC1) and tail domains, respectively, which may interfere with autoinhibition and cargo binding.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:**\n    *   Moderate for biallelic missense variants causing MAC spectrum disease.\n    *   Weak to limited for monoallelic variants and neuropsychiatric phenotypes.\n\n#### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.1255C>T (p.Arg419Trp):**\n    *   Significance: Likely Pathogenic (reported in literature).\n    *   Reported Phenotypes: Microphthalmia, Coloboma, mild developmental delay (in compound heterozygosity with p.Arg852Cys).\n    *   Allele Frequency: Very low frequency in population databases.\n*   **c.2554C>T (p.Arg852Cys):**\n    *   Significance: Likely Pathogenic (reported in literature).\n    *   Reported Phenotypes: Microphthalmia, Coloboma, mild developmental delay (in compound heterozygosity with p.Arg419Trp).\n    *   Allele Frequency: Very low frequency in population databases.\n*   **p.Arg869Cys (R869C):**\n    *   Significance: VUS/Likely Pathogenic (reported in literature).\n    *   Reported Phenotypes: Suggested as a risk factor for Dementia with Lewy Bodies, particularly in carriers of the GBA-N370S mutation.\n    *   Allele Frequency: Not specified, found in a case-control study.\n*   **De novo truncating mutation (unspecified):**\n    *   Significance: VUS (reported in literature).\n    *   Reported Phenotypes: Schizophrenia.\n\n#### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx, other):** High expression is observed in the testis, brain (including frontal lobe, pons, cerebellum), and retina.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:**\n    *   Expression in the retina and its role in photoreceptor outer segment development is consistent with the observed ocular phenotypes (MAC spectrum).\n    *   Expression in various brain regions is consistent with its role in neuronal transport and the reported associations with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** KIF17 is critical for cerebellar development in mice, influencing proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron progenitors via the Hedgehog pathway, which aligns with potential neurodevelopmental phenotypes.\n\n#### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** KIF17 is a plus-end-directed microtubule motor protein that transports cellular cargo, including vesicles containing NMDA receptors in neurons and proteins essential for ciliogenesis via intraflagellar transport (IFT).\n*   **Disease Mechanism:**\n    *   The mechanism for MAC spectrum disease is likely hypomorphic function resulting from biallelic missense variants, impairing its transport function in photoreceptor development, which is a highly modified primary cilium.\n    *   For neuropsychiatric phenotypes, a dominant-negative or haploinsufficiency mechanism has been proposed for monoallelic variants, disrupting neuronal cargo transport.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   Disruption of intraflagellar transport in photoreceptors leads to defects in outer segment development and disc morphogenesis, causing structural eye anomalies like coloboma and microphthalmia.\n    *   Impaired transport of NMDA receptors in dendrites can alter synaptic plasticity and neuronal function, potentially contributing to psychiatric or cognitive symptoms.\n    *   Altered Hedgehog (HH) signaling due to KIF17 dysfunction can impact cerebellar development and progenitor cell proliferation.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** KIF17 interacts with the IFT-B complex for ciliary entry and with Apba1 (Mint1) to transport vesicles containing the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor.\n\n#### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield is likely low given the rarity of associated cases. Biallelic variants in KIF17 explain a very small percentage of MAC spectrum cases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for KIF17 may be considered in individuals with congenital eye defects, particularly microphthalmia and coloboma, especially when initial testing of more common genes is negative.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Management is supportive and tailored to the phenotype, including ophthalmologic monitoring and intervention for visual impairment and neurodevelopmental support for delays.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For MAC spectrum disease, counseling for autosomal recessive inheritance is indicated. This involves discussing a 25% recurrence risk for future pregnancies of carrier parents. Counseling for dominant neuropsychiatric phenotypes is more complex due to limited evidence and incomplete penetrance.\n\n#### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 36715694 (2024):** Robert et al. demonstrated dual and opposing roles for KIF17 in Hedgehog-dependent cerebellar development in mice, with germline deletion causing cerebellar hypoplasia, linking the gene to neurodevelopment.\n*   **PMID: 34085816 (2021):** Matin et al. reported a likely pathogenic missense variant (R869C) in KIF17 enriched in patients with Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), suggesting it as a risk factor.\n*   **PMID: 33924080 (2021):** Bell-Ait-Yaha et al. described a family with two siblings who had congenital coloboma, microphthalmia, and mild motor delay due to compound heterozygous missense variants in KIF17, establishing the primary genotype-phenotype correlation for this gene.\n*   **PMID: 28495831 (2017):** Gulsuner et al. identified a de novo truncating mutation in KIF17 in an individual with schizophrenia, suggesting a potential role in this disorder.\n*   **PMID: 20658032 (2010):** Yin et al. published a comprehensive review of KIF17 function, detailing its roles in NMDA receptor transport, ciliogenesis, spermatogenesis, and links to learning, memory, and disease.\n\n#### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:**\n    *   Compound heterozygous missense variants (e.g., c.1255C>T; p.Arg419Trp and c.2554C>T; p.Arg852Cys) are strongly associated with a phenotype combining **Microphthalmia (HP:0000568)** and **Coloboma (HP:0000589)**.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:**\n    *   The presence of congenital, bilateral **coloboma** and/or **microphthalmia** in a patient with a negative result for more common causative genes should raise suspicion for KIF17-related disease, especially if inheritance appears recessive.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**\n    *   The MAC spectrum phenotype overlaps with numerous other genes involved in ocular development and ciliopathies.\n    *   Neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with KIF17 are broad and overlap with many other genetic neurodevelopmental disorders. The KIF1A-related neurological disorders present with spastic paraplegia and ataxia, which are generally more severe than phenotypes described for KIF17.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in KIF17 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "TP53BP2": "TP53BP2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\nHere is the comprehensive clinical genetics dossier for the human gene TP53BP2.\n\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **Gene Identifiers**: HGNC: 12000; OMIM: 602143.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations**: Primarily studied for its role as a tumor suppressor, where its downregulation is associated with the development and poor prognosis of multiple cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, and gastric cancer. It is also identified as a strong candidate gene for the central nervous system (CNS) defects observed in 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome. A potential association with Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) has been reported in a single large family.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The role of somatic TP53BP2 downregulation in cancer progression is well-documented. Its role as a causative gene for the CNS phenotype in the 1q41q42 microdeletion is rated as strong candidacy. The evidence for a role in monogenic POAG is currently limited, based on a single family study.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns**: For the potential association with POAG, an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern was speculated. For its role in cancer, alterations are typically somatic; a clear Mendelian inheritance pattern for cancer predisposition via germline variants is not well-established.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **gnomAD Constraint Scores**: Numeric constraint scores (pLI, LOEUF) were not available in the provided search results.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint**: Without specific constraint scores, a definitive interpretation of haploinsufficiency intolerance cannot be made. However, its potential role in the 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome suggests a possible haploinsufficiency mechanism.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Loss-of-function variants are implicated in cancer, as downregulation is consistently linked to tumorigenesis. Specific truncating variants and alternative splice variants have been shown to be oncogenic. Missense variants are also potentially pathogenic, as demonstrated in a family with POAG.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO Terms**:\n    *   Hepatocellular carcinoma\n    *   Breast carcinoma (Triple-negative and Lobular)\n    *   Primary open-angle glaucoma\n    *   Lung cancer\n    *   Gastric cancer\n    *   Soft tissue sarcoma\n    *   Acute myeloid leukemia\n    *   Loss of retinal ganglion cells\n*   **Secondary HPO Terms**:\n    *   Chemotherapy resistance\n    *   Abnormality of cell migration\n    *   Decreased apoptosis\n    *   Increased cell proliferation\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: The associated cancers are typically adult-onset. The age of onset for the potential glaucoma phenotype was not specified.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: The associated cancer phenotypes are severe, often correlated with poor prognosis and low survival rates. The glaucoma phenotype was significant enough to affect multiple individuals across generations in a large family.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Phenotypes**: Reduced expression (loss-of-function) is broadly correlated with tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis across various cancers. A truncated isoform (t-TP53BP2) is associated with lobular breast carcinoma. An alternative splice variant (ASPP2\u03ba) is prevalent in acute leukemia and considered oncogenic. A missense variant (p.Val37Met) has been linked to POAG.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: The C-terminal domain is critical for p53 interaction and pro-apoptotic function; an isoform lacking this domain is associated with colorectal tumors. The N-terminal region is involved in binding to RAS, which enhances p53-mediated apoptosis. The SH3 domain mediates interaction with the Hepatitis C virus NS5A protein.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: The correlation between TP53BP2 downregulation and poor prognosis in several major cancers is strong. The correlation between specific splice or truncated variants and certain cancers (leukemia, breast cancer) is moderate. The link between the p.Val37Met missense variant and POAG is currently weak, as it is based on a single family.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **Characterized Pathogenic Variants**:\n    *   **HGVS**: c.109G>A (p.Val37Met) / **Significance**: Uncertain Significance (reported as potentially pathogenic) / **Reported Phenotypes**: Primary Open Angle Glaucoma / **AF**: Not reported in search results.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence**: Evidence for specific single nucleotide variants is limited in the provided search results. The strongest evidence relates to downregulation of the gene or expression of oncogenic isoforms rather than specific germline variants.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues & Clinical Correlation**: High expression is noted in the liver, mammary gland, lung, and stomach, which correlates with the observation that its downregulation is implicated in cancers of these organs. Expression in the retina and lens is consistent with its potential role in glaucoma.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Loss of expression in the liver can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. Loss of expression in breast tissue is associated with breast cancer. Altered function in retinal ganglion cells may contribute to glaucoma.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: TP53BP2 is a key regulator of apoptosis and cell growth, primarily through its interaction with and enhancement of the TP53 tumor suppressor.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: In cancer, the primary mechanism is loss-of-function, acting as a tumor suppressor; this can occur via downregulation, truncating mutations, or the expression of dominant-negative/oncogenic isoforms. For developmental defects such as those in 1q41-q42 deletion syndrome, the mechanism is likely haploinsufficiency.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**: The central disrupted pathway is p53-mediated apoptosis. Its loss also dysregulates other critical pathways including RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and NF-\u03baB, leading to increased cell proliferation and migration, and decreased apoptosis, which are hallmarks of cancer.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: Its direct binding to TP53 is essential for promoting apoptosis. Interactions with RAS, YAP, Bcl-2, and other proteins are also critical for regulating cell function and suppressing tumorigenesis.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield**: The diagnostic yield of sequencing TP53BP2 for specific Mendelian disorders is not yet established and was not reported in the search results.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing**: Testing is most relevant in a research or clinical trial context to assess prognosis in cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma, where low expression correlates with poor outcomes. It could be considered in unsolved familial cases of POAG or individuals with features of 1q41-q42 microdeletion.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: Low expression in tumors is associated with chemoresistance, which could potentially guide therapeutic choices. As its overexpression can induce apoptosis, it is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target in cancer.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling for a variant associated with POAG would emphasize the limited evidence and unknown penetrance. For a germline variant found incidentally, counseling would be challenging due to the undefined cancer risks, though its role as a tumor suppressor would be discussed.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 37492707** (2022): A comprehensive review detailing the roles of TP53BP2 as a tumor suppressor in various cancers and its regulation of key signaling pathways like p53, RAS/MAPK, and PI3K/AKT.\n*   **PMID: 28246638** (2017): The first study to link a variant in TP53BP2 (p.Val37Met) to Primary Open Angle Glaucoma in a large family, suggesting it as a novel candidate gene.\n*   **PubMed (from Cancer Genetics Web)** (2019): Report on an alternative splice variant, ASPP2\u03ba, acting as a stress-inducible, oncogenic isoform with high prevalence in acute leukemia.\n*   **NCBI Gene ID: 7159**: GeneRIF entry noting that TP53BP2 is a strong candidate gene for CNS defects in the 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome.\n*   **PMID: 36166164** (2022): This study (part of a broader search result) highlights that TP53BP2 interacts with various proteins to regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and drug resistance, reinforcing its role as a potential antitumor target.\n*   **PMID: 31032230** (2019): Paper cited in search result indicating a truncated TP53BP2 isoform promotes tumorigenesis in lobular breast carcinoma through distinct mechanisms of actomyosin relaxation and YAP activation.\n*   **NCBI Gene ID: 7159**: GeneRIF entry showing that ASPP2 (TP53BP2) suppression promotes malignancy via LSR and YAP in human endometrial cancer.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**: Downregulation or loss-of-function of TP53BP2 is strongly associated with cancer progression phenotypes, including increased cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, and poor prognosis in hepatocellular, breast, and other carcinomas.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags**: The presence of lobular breast carcinoma or acute leukemia with specific oncogenic isoforms (t-TP53BP2, ASPP2\u03ba) should raise suspicion of TP53BP2 involvement. While evidence is limited, familial POAG unexplained by other genes could be a minor red flag.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**: For glaucoma, other POAG-associated genes (e.g., *MYOC*, *OPTN*) are primary considerations. Given its role as a p53 interactor, phenotypes overlapping with the p53 pathway dysfunction (e.g., Li-Fraumeni Syndrome) could be considered, although the genetic basis is distinct. For the 1q41-q42 deletion phenotype, other genes in the critical region, such as *DISP1*, must be considered.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in TP53BP2 (3/3):\nN/A.

        "PCDH1": "PCDH1 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: PCDH1**\n\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 8655\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 603626\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While primarily studied in the context of asthma and atopic diseases, PCDH1 has also been linked to Hantavirus Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome and Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome. It has also been identified as a receptor for New World hantaviruses.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for association with bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma is moderate, based on multiple association studies. Its role in other conditions is still emerging.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** The inheritance patterns for PCDH1-associated phenotypes are complex and appear to be multifactorial, influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** A search for PCDH1 on gnomAD reveals a pLI score, which indicates a gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variants. A high pLI score (closer to 1) suggests intolerance. The LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) is another metric where lower values indicate intolerance. Specific numeric values for PCDH1 from the most recent gnomAD version are not available in the search results.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Genes with high pLI scores (typically \u2265 0.9) are considered highly likely to be intolerant to loss-of-function mutations, which are often associated with dominant genetic diseases and haploinsufficiency. A low LOEUF score also points towards intolerance to inactivation.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For genes intolerant to loss-of-function, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants are most likely to be pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Bronchial hyperreactivity (HP:0002875)\n    *   Asthma (HP:0002099)\n    *   Eczema (HP:0000964)\n    *   Atopic dermatitis (HP:0001047)\n    *   Wheezing (HP:0030828)\n    *   Allergic rhinitis (HP:0003192)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Recurrent respiratory infections (HP:0002205)\n    *   Cough (HP:0012735)\n    *   Chest tightness (HP:0002877)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes such as transient early wheeze and atopic dermatitis are often observed in early childhood. Asthma associated with PCDH1 can manifest in childhood and continue into adulthood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of respiratory phenotypes can range from mild, transient wheezing to more persistent and severe asthma.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific gene variants in PCDH1 have been significantly associated with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in multiple populations. Polymorphisms in the gene are also linked to the pathogenesis of asthma and allergic dermatitis.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The PCDH1 protein has an extracellular region with cadherin-like domains, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic region. Dysfunction in its role in cell-cell adhesion and epithelial barrier integrity is thought to contribute to the associated phenotypes.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between PCDH1 variants and bronchial hyperresponsiveness is considered moderate to strong, having been replicated in several studies. The association with asthma and atopic conditions is also consistently reported.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** The variant rs3797054 has been specifically implicated in the development of BHR.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   ClinVar lists natural variants in PCDH1, such as rs12517385 and rs12515587, although their clinical significance in the context of monogenic disease is not clearly defined. Most of the literature focuses on the association of common variants with complex phenotypes like asthma rather than single pathogenic variants causing a Mendelian disorder.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** PCDH1 mRNA and protein are expressed in airway epithelial cells, macrophages, skin, and throughout all epithelial and endothelial lineages during mouse embryonic development. High expression is also noted in the brain and neuro-glial cells. This expression pattern aligns with its role in epithelial barrier function in the lungs and skin, correlating with asthma and eczema phenotypes.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its expression in the airway epithelium, variants in PCDH1 are expected to lead to respiratory phenotypes like bronchial hyperresponsiveness and asthma. Its expression in skin keratinocytes corresponds to its association with atopic dermatitis and eczema.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** PCDH1 is expressed as early as embryonic day 9.5 in mice, with prominent expression in blood vessels during early embryogenesis. Its continuous expression and regulation during development and in mature tissues suggest multiple roles.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function in One Sentence:** PCDH1 is a cell adhesion molecule that plays a crucial role in maintaining epithelial barrier integrity and is involved in neural cell adhesion.\n*   **Disease Mechanism: Haploinsufficiency, Dominant-Negative, Gain-of-Function:** The likely disease mechanism for PCDH1-associated phenotypes is a loss of function, leading to impaired epithelial barrier integrity. This could be due to haploinsufficiency, where one functional copy of the gene is not enough.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of PCDH1 function leads to a weaker epithelial barrier, which can cause a dysregulated response to environmental triggers and antigens, leading to inflammation and the development of asthma and eczema. PCDH1 has been shown to interact with SMAD3 to modulate TGF-\u03b2\u2013induced gene transcription.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** PCDH1 interacts with protein phosphatase 1\u03b1 (PP1\u03b1) through its conserved cytoplasmic domain, which is relevant to its signaling functions. It also interacts with Desmoplakin, a scaffold protein.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 18511562, Year: 2008:** First identified PCDH1 as a novel susceptibility gene for bronchial hyperresponsiveness in both children and adults through positional cloning, suggesting its role in airway epithelial integrity.\n*   **PMID: 30416954, Year: 2018:** A literature review summarizing the role of PCDH1 in childhood asthma, eczema, and other atopic phenotypes, highlighting its function in epithelial barrier formation and repair.\n*   **PMID: 37964405, Year: 2023:** A study on pancreatic adenocarcinoma that showed high PCDH1 expression correlated with poor prognosis and metastasis, indicating a role in cancer progression through NF-\u03baB signaling.\n*   **PMID: 19183307, Year: 2009:** A study on mouse development showing the widespread and tightly regulated expression of Pcdh1, suggesting its multiple roles in development and mature tissues.\n*   **PMID: 12435422, Year: 2002:** A foundational paper describing the role of protocadherins in homologous cell adhesion and organ development, particularly in the nervous system.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Variants in PCDH1 are strongly associated with Bronchial hyperreactivity (HP:0002875), Asthma (HP:0002099), and Atopic dermatitis (HP:0001047).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** A combination of early-onset asthma or wheezing with co-occurring eczema should raise suspicion for the involvement of PCDH1 variants.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The atopic phenotypes associated with PCDH1 overlap with those caused by variants in other genes involved in epithelial barrier function, such as FLG (filaggrin). The broader cadherin superfamily of genes is also involved in cell adhesion and can present with overlapping features.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PCDH1 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "KLRC2": "KLRC2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n- **HGNC ID:** 6375\n- **OMIM Gene ID:** 602891\n- **Primary Disease Associations:** While not linked to a Mendelian disease, KLRC2 variation, particularly gene deletion, is associated with susceptibility to and severity of viral infections, including Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and severe COVID-19. It has also been investigated in the context of psoriasis and HIV, with some studies suggesting an association.\n- **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of KLRC2 variants is currently considered associative, influencing susceptibility and response to infectious diseases rather than causing a monogenic disorder.\n- **Inheritance Patterns:** The KLRC2 gene can be deleted in a heterozygous or homozygous state, which is a common polymorphism in the general population. The deletion allele frequency varies across different populations.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n- **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) of 0.00, an observed/expected (o/e) LoF upper bound fraction (LOEUF) of 1.13, a pRec of 0.61, and a pNull of 0.39.\n- **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The very low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that the KLRC2 gene is highly tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. This is consistent with the observation that homozygous deletion of KLRC2 is found in healthy individuals. These scores suggest that LoF variants are not expected to cause a severe Mendelian disease.\n- **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to LoF, pathogenic variants are less likely to be simple null alleles. However, variants affecting the protein's function, such as missense or in-frame deletions that alter interactions with other proteins like KLRD1 (CD94), could have clinical consequences related to immune response.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n- **Primary HPO terms:** As KLRC2 is not associated with a Mendelian disorder, a standard HPO-based phenotype spectrum is not applicable. Phenotypes are primarily related to altered immune function.\n- **Secondary HPO terms:** Phenotypic consequences relate to \"Increased susceptibility to viral infections.\"\n- **Age of Onset Patterns:** The impact of KLRC2 variants, such as the deletion, can become apparent at any age upon exposure to specific viral pathogens like HCMV or SARS-CoV-2.\n- **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity associated with KLRC2 deletion ranges from no clinical phenotype to increased severity of viral infections, such as severe COVID-19.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n- **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous or heterozygous deletion of the KLRC2 gene is the most studied variation. This deletion is associated with an altered adaptive Natural Killer (NK) cell response and can lead to poorer control of viral infections.\n- **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The KLRC2 protein forms a heterodimer with KLRD1 (CD94) to recognize HLA-E molecules on target cells. Variants disrupting the C-type lectin domain or the interaction with KLRD1 would be expected to impair NK cell activation.\n- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between KLRC2 deletion and susceptibility to severe viral infections is considered moderate, as it is a risk factor rather than a deterministic cause. The presence of the deletion has been linked to lower counts of adaptive NK cells.\n- **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** The 16-kb deletion of the KLRC2 gene is associated with the absence of the NKG2C receptor on the cell surface in homozygous individuals, leading to a diminished adaptive NK cell response to HCMV.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n- Characterization of pathogenic single nucleotide variants or small indels is limited, as the most significant known variation is the whole gene deletion.\n- **KLRC2 gene deletion (del/del):** Associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 and impaired control of HCMV infection. Allele frequency is variable across populations.\n- **KLRC2 gene deletion (wt/del):** Heterozygous carriers may have a reduced number of adaptive NK cells compared to wild-type individuals.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** KLRC2 shows the highest expression in whole blood.\n- **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its primary expression in NK cells and some T-cell subsets, phenotypes are expected to be confined to the immune system, specifically affecting anti-viral and anti-tumor surveillance.\n- **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression is tied to the maturation and activation of NK cells. The consequences of KLRC2 variation can manifest throughout life, particularly in response to infections that trigger adaptive NK cell responses.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal Gene Function:** The KLRC2 gene encodes the NKG2C protein, an activating receptor on NK cells and some cytotoxic T-cells that recognizes HLA-E molecules on target cells, playing a role in the immune response to viral infections and cellular stress.\n- **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism associated with clinical phenotypes is loss of function due to gene deletion, leading to an impaired or absent adaptive NK cell response. This can be considered a form of haploinsufficiency in heterozygotes, though the clinical impact is variable.\n- **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the Natural Killer cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway (KEGG: hsa04650) and DAP12 signaling impairs the ability of the immune system to recognize and eliminate virally infected cells, leading to increased susceptibility and severity of infections.\n- **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction between KLRC2 (NKG2C) and KLRD1 (CD94) is essential for forming the functional receptor. This receptor complex then interacts with TYROBP (DAP12) for signal transduction. Disruption of these interactions prevents the activation of NK cells.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n- **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for KLRC2 is generally not performed for diagnostic purposes of a specific disease but rather in research settings to assess immune function or risk for severe infections.\n- **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is primarily done to investigate the immune response to viral infections like HCMV, HIV, or SARS-CoV-2, and in the context of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.\n- **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Knowledge of KLRC2 deletion status could potentially inform risk stratification for patients with certain viral infections, although this is not yet standard clinical practice.\n- **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling would involve explaining that the KLRC2 deletion is a common polymorphism with variable penetrance for infection susceptibility and does not cause a classic Mendelian disease.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- **PMID: 35018659, 2022:** Reported that KLRC2 deletion was associated with significantly lower adaptive NK cells and tended to be associated with CMV viremia in patients with severe COVID-19.\n- **PMID: 27311985, 2016:** Found that the frequency of homozygous KLRC2 deletion varies significantly between African populations but found no association with trachoma.\n- **PMID: 27508088, 2016:** Describes molecular genetic analyses for detecting KLRC2 gene deletion and discusses its association with various diseases, including HIV and psoriasis.\n- **PMID: 31215112, 2019:** Reports a new KLRC2 allele (NKG2C*03) and highlights the presence of both complete gene deletions and sequence polymorphism in the population.\n- **PMID: 38454238, 2024:** A recent study showing that KLRC2 expression in glioblastoma tumor cells is associated with a better response to immunotherapy (PD-1 blockade).\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n- **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** No high-confidence HPO-variant associations exist in the traditional sense for a Mendelian disease. The primary association is between the KLRC2 gene deletion and increased susceptibility to severe viral infections.\n- **Phenotype red flags:** A history of severe or recurrent HCMV infection, or severe COVID-19, particularly in the context of CMV reactivation, could suggest that investigating the KLRC2 deletion status may be relevant.\n- **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The clinical picture of immunodeficiency associated with KLRC2 deletion overlaps with other primary and secondary immunodeficiencies affecting NK cell function. Therefore, a broader immunological workup would be necessary.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in KLRC2 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "HCAR2": "HCAR2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:24827\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 609163\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While strongly associated with modulating inflammatory responses and lipid metabolism, direct Mendelian disease associations are not well-established. It has been linked to conditions such as Pellagra and Diversion Colitis. It has also been studied for its role in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, as well as its potential as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The direct clinical significance for a specific Mendelian disorder remains to be definitively established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** No clear inheritance patterns for a specific disease have been documented.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v4.0 constraint metrics for *HCAR2* are not explicitly detailed in the provided search results, however gnomAD's methodology for calculating these scores such as pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant), and LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) is available. A higher pLI (closer to 1) and a lower LOEUF suggest a gene is more intolerant to loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A high pLI (e.g., \u22650.9) or a low LOEUF (e.g., <0.35 in gnomAD v2) for a gene suggests that it is under selective pressure and that loss-of-function variants are likely to be pathogenic. The interpretation often depends on the specific transcript being analyzed.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Based on its function as a receptor, missense variants that affect ligand binding or signal transduction, as well as nonsense and frameshift variants leading to a non-functional protein, would be most likely to be pathogenic. Frameshift and missense variants in *HCAR2* have been investigated in the context of breast cancer risk.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As there is no definitive Mendelian disease associated with *HCAR2*, a ranked list of HPO terms is not available. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for phenotypic abnormalities in human diseases but does not currently list specific phenotypes for *HCAR2*.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Not applicable due to the lack of a defined Mendelian disease association.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not defined due to the absence of an associated Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not defined.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific genotype-phenotype correlations are not well-established. However, studies have investigated the association of coding variants with the response to niacin therapy for dyslipidemia, but no significant associations were found. Rare, potentially pathogenic variants, including frameshift and missense mutations, have been identified in breast cancer cases, suggesting a potential role in cancer susceptibility.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The C-terminal tail of the HCAR2 protein contains common coding variants, but their functional impact and association with specific phenotypes remain largely unknown. Variants affecting transmembrane domains or ligand-binding pockets would be hypothesized to impact receptor function.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Currently weak, as no definitive disease-causing variants with consistent phenotypic outcomes have been established.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   rs7314976 (p.Arg311C) and rs2454727 (p.Met317Ile) are common coding variants that have been studied in relation to niacin response, but no clear phenotype has been associated with them.\n    *   A frameshift mutation, c.1086_1090del (p.P363Nfs*26), and several missense variants have been identified in breast cancer cohorts, suggesting a potential association with cancer risk.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   There are no well-characterized pathogenic variants with confirmed clinical significance in ClinVar for a specific Mendelian disease. Several variants of uncertain significance have been reported. Studies have identified variants in the context of complex diseases like breast cancer, but their pathogenicity is not fully established.\n    *   **c.1086_1090del (p.P363Nfs*26):** Frameshift variant identified in breast cancer cases.\n    *   **c.424C>T (p.Arg142Trp):** Missense variant associated with breast cancer risk.\n    *   **c.517_518delinsAC (p.Gly173Thr):** Missense variant associated with breast cancer risk.\n    *   **c.1036A>G (p.Met346Val):** Missense variant associated with breast cancer risk.\n    *   **rs7314976 (c.931C>T, p.Arg311C):** Common coding variant, no confirmed disease association.\n    *   **rs2454727 (c.951G>A, p.Met317Ile):** Common coding variant, no confirmed disease association.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** *HCAR2* shows the highest expression in adipose tissue and spleen. It is also expressed in immune cells like neutrophils and microglia. This expression pattern aligns with its role in regulating lipolysis and inflammation.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its high expression in adipose tissue, variants could lead to metabolic phenotypes related to lipid metabolism. Its expression in immune cells suggests that pathogenic variants could result in inflammatory or immunodeficiency-related phenotypes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression of *HCAR2* is induced in microglia in the context of Alzheimer's disease pathology, suggesting a role in age-related neuroinflammation. Knockout mice show a progressive degenerative retinal phenotype with age.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *HCAR2* encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that acts as a high-affinity receptor for nicotinic acid (niacin) and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, mediating decreased lipolysis and modulating inflammatory responses.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Loss-of-function variants are hypothesized to be the primary disease-causing mechanism, potentially through haploinsufficiency, as suggested by studies in breast cancer where it may act as a tumor suppressor.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of HCAR2 signaling can impact the G(i)-protein-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, leading to altered cAMP levels. This can affect downstream pathways involved in lipolysis in adipocytes and inflammatory responses in immune cells. In microglia, HCAR2 activation can promote an anti-inflammatory phenotype and inhibit neuroinflammation.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** As a GPCR, HCAR2 interacts with G(i) proteins to initiate its signaling cascade. Its function is also linked to pathways involving AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and NF-\u03baB.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for *HCAR2* in clinical cohorts for any specific Mendelian disease is currently zero or not reported, as it is not yet associated with a definitive disease phenotype.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for *HCAR2* variants is currently primarily in a research setting, particularly in studies of dyslipidemia response to niacin, neuroinflammatory disorders, and cancer susceptibility.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there is no direct clinical actionability based on *HCAR2* genotype alone. However, its role as the niacin receptor suggests that variants could influence the therapeutic response to niacin. Furthermore, its involvement in inflammatory pathways suggests it could be a therapeutic target for inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the lack of a clear disease association, genetic counseling would focus on the uncertain significance of any identified variants and the current state of research.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 32328562 (2020):** This study in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease demonstrated that HCAR2 is induced in microglia and that its absence exacerbates amyloid pathology and cognitive deficits, highlighting its role in neuroinflammation.\n*   **PMID: 29940600 (2018):** Investigated common coding variants in *HCAR2* and their association with lipid response to niacin therapy in the AIM-HIGH cohort, finding no significant correlation.\n*   **PMID: 30154941 (2018):** Identified rare and potentially pathogenic variants in *HCAR2* in breast cancer cases, suggesting a role as a tumor suppressor.\n*   **PMID: 12616187 (2003):** One of the initial studies that identified HCAR2 (then called GPR109A) as a high-affinity receptor for nicotinic acid.\n*   **PMID: 12616186 (2003):** Concurrently with the above study, this paper also identified HCAR2 (then called PUMA-G) as the nicotinic acid receptor and described its role in mediating the anti-lipolytic effects of niacin.\n*   **bioRxiv (2021):** A study on knockout mice suggested that HCAR2 expression is important for maintaining an immunoinhibitory environment in the retina and that its absence leads to progressive retinal degeneration.\n*   **PMID: 29997787 (2018):** This paper discusses the role of HCAR2 as a receptor for monomethyl fumarate, a drug used for multiple sclerosis, and its implications for the inflammatory response.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no established high-confidence HPO-variant associations for *HCAR2*.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** Based on its function and expression, phenotypes such as severe dyslipidemia unresponsive to standard therapies, early-onset neuroinflammatory conditions, or a strong family history of breast cancer with a potential loss-of-function variant might warrant further investigation of *HCAR2*, although this is speculative.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Given its role in inflammation and metabolism, phenotypic overlap could exist with genes involved in familial hypercholesterolemia, lipodystrophies, and primary immunodeficiencies. However, without a defined *HCAR2*-related disease, this remains hypothetical.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in HCAR2 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "PARP4": "PARP4 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: PARP4**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:8624\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 607519\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Currently, PARP4 is not definitively associated with a Mendelian disease; however, it is implicated as a candidate gene in cancer susceptibility, with variants and expression changes noted in breast, thyroid, lung, ovarian, and colon cancers.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for a role in cancer susceptibility is emerging and would be considered limited or moderate; there is no established clinical significance for a monogenic Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** The role of germline variants in cancer susceptibility is under investigation, with some rare variants observed in case-control studies. A clear inheritance pattern has not been established.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    *   pLI (probability of being Loss-of-function Intolerant): 0.00\n    *   LOEUF (Loss-of-function Observed/Expected Upper bound Fraction): 0.786\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The pLI score of 0.0 and a LOEUF score of 0.786 indicate that PARP4 is not significantly constrained against loss-of-function (LoF) variants in the general population. This suggests the gene is tolerant of heterozygous LoF variants, and haploinsufficiency is not a likely disease mechanism.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While the gene is tolerant to LoF variation overall, specific missense variants (e.g., I1039T) have been shown to have a loss-of-function effect and promote tumorigenicity in somatic contexts. The role of germline variants is still being elucidated, with some studies pointing to rare missense variants being associated with cancer risk.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are definitively associated with germline PARP4 variants. The primary phenotype is predisposition to or modulation of cancer.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Not applicable due to the lack of an associated Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not defined for a Mendelian disease; in cancer, its role is studied in the context of adult-onset malignancies.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** In cancer studies, low PARP4 expression or specific mutations are associated with poorer prognosis and more aggressive disease in some cancer types, such as breast and esophageal cancer.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Loss-of-function:** PARP4 deficiency in mouse models leads to increased susceptibility to carcinogen-induced colon tumors. The somatic I1039T mutation in lung cancer acts as a LoF variant, promoting tumorigenicity.\n    *   **Missense:** Germline missense variants G496V and T1170I were found at a higher frequency in individuals with primary thyroid and breast cancers.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The I1039T mutation, which may destabilize the protein, is associated with a loss-of-function phenotype in lung cancer. The protein has a PARP catalytic domain, but its activity may be regulated by protein-protein interactions via its C-terminus rather than direct DNA binding.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Weak. While some variants and expression levels are associated with cancer risk and prognosis, the evidence is not yet strong enough to establish definitive correlations for clinical prediction.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   Currently, ClinVar lists no variants for PARP4 with a \"Pathogenic\" or \"Likely Pathogenic\" classification for a Mendelian disorder. Numerous variants of uncertain significance are listed.\n*   **Variants from Literature:**\n    *   **HGVS: c.1487G>T / p.Gly496Val:** Reported in individuals with primary thyroid and breast cancers.\n    *   **HGVS: c.3508A>A/T / p.Thr1170Ile:** Found in individuals with primary thyroid and breast cancers.\n    *   **HGVS: c.3115T>A / p.Ile1039T:** A recurrent somatic mutation in lung adenocarcinoma, associated with increased tumorigenicity and considered a loss-of-function variant.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to the Human Protein Atlas, which incorporates GTEx data, PARP4 shows highest RNA expression in the rectum, duodenum, monocyte, gallbladder, and bone marrow.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The role of PARP4 as a potential tumor suppressor appears to be cancer-type dependent, with effects observed in colon and lung cancer models. Its expression level has prognostic significance in ovarian, breast, and esophageal cancer.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Information on developmental expression is limited. Current data relates to its role in adult-onset diseases (cancers).\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** PARP4 encodes an enzyme that catalyzes poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and is involved in cellular processes such as DNA repair and inflammatory response.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** In cancer, the primary proposed mechanism is loss-of-function, acting as a tumor suppressor. However, in some cancers like ovarian, high expression is linked to chemoresistance and poor prognosis, suggesting a context-dependent role.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Splicing Regulation:** PARP4 interacts with the splicing regulator hnRNPM; disruption of this interaction perturbs splicing and promotes tumorigenicity in lung cancer, independent of its role in the vault complex.\n    *   **DNA Repair/Chemoresistance:** While thought to be involved in base excision repair, direct evidence is lacking. Its expression is linked to cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer, potentially through epigenetic mechanisms regulating its promoter.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Zero for Mendelian disorders. For cancer predisposition, its utility is currently investigational and not part of standard clinical testing panels.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is currently performed in a research context to investigate cancer susceptibility or for prognostic studies in specific cancers.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present. There are no specific management guidelines based on PARP4 genotype.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the tolerant gnomAD constraint scores and lack of definitive disease association, caution is warranted when interpreting rare PARP4 variants. An incidental finding of a rare variant would likely be classified as a VUS.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 37013346 (2023):** Showed that PARP4 expression is upregulated in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines and patient tissues due to promoter hypomethylation, suggesting it as a biomarker for chemoresistance.\n*   **PMID: 35198822 (2022):** Identified germline PARP4 variants (G496V, T1170I) at a higher frequency in patients with both primary thyroid and breast cancers, suggesting it as a candidate susceptibility gene.\n*   **(2024):** A study on lung adenocarcinoma revealed that PARP4 loss or mutation (I1039T) promotes tumorigenicity by disrupting splicing through its interaction with hnRNPM, a mechanism independent of the vault complex.\n*   **PMID: 34151756 (2021):** A review summarizing the role of PARP family members in cancer, noting low PARP4 expression is correlated with poor survival in breast cancer and high expression with poor survival in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n*   **PMID: 37013346 (2023):** Demonstrated that depletion of PARP4 in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells reduces chemoresistance and enhances DNA fragmentation.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** None established. The gene is not currently linked to a specific Mendelian syndrome with a defined set of HPO terms.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are no \"red flag\" HPO terms. A clinical history of multiple primary tumors (e.g., breast and thyroid) could be a suggestive feature for investigating candidate genes like PARP4 in a research setting.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** In a patient with a potential cancer predisposition syndrome, differential diagnoses would include more well-established cancer predisposition genes associated with the specific tumor types observed (e.g., BRCA1/2, PTEN, TP53).\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PARP4 (1/1):\nN/A. Variant: 13:24441954 C>T | Gene: PARP4 | GT: 0|1 | IDs: rs55888616, COSV67963000 | AF: 1KG=0.3846, gnomAD=0.3405, gnomADg=0.3706 | ACMG: Benign (BA1, BP4, BS1, PM1) | ClinVar: benign | Scores: SIFT=N/A, Polyphen=N/A, CADD=N/A, REVEL=N/A, SpliceAI=PARP4 (AG=0.01, AL=0.00, DG=0.00, DL=0.00), DANN=N/A, MetalR=N/A | Alpha Missense: N/A (N/A) | OMIM: N/A",
        "BSN": "BSN Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: BSN**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 1117.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 604020.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Bassoon-related neurodevelopmental disorder, which can include epilepsy, developmental delay, behavioral phenotypes, and obesity. Other reported associations include epilepsy with a favorable outcome and a progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between BSN variants and epilepsy has been evaluated as \"strong\" based on the ClinGen framework.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Autosomal dominant inheritance, often arising de novo, is observed for protein-truncating variants. Autosomal recessive inheritance involving compound heterozygous variants has also been reported.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint scores for BSN (transcript NM_003458.3) are pLI = 1.00, pNull = 0, pRec = 0. The LOEUF is 0.08 (90% CI 0.04-0.15).\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A pLI score of \u22650.9 is considered extremely intolerant of loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The BSN pLI score of 1.00 and very low LOEUF score strongly indicate that the gene is haploinsufficient and does not tolerate the loss of one functional copy.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Protein-truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift) are a primary class of pathogenic variants, consistent with haploinsufficiency. Missense variants, both de novo and in compound heterozygous states, have also been reported as pathogenic.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n    *   Febrile seizure (HP:0002373).\n    *   Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).\n    *   Obesity (HP:0001513).\n    *   Behavioral disinhibition (p=3.39e-17 association).\n    *   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (HP:0007018).\n    *   Autistic behavior (HP:0000729).\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (HP:0002069).\n    *   Focal-onset seizure (HP:0007359).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Adult-onset severe obesity.\n    *   Type 2 diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978).\n    *   Hepatic steatosis (HP:0001397).\n    *   Progressive supranuclear ophthalmoplegia (HP:0000641).\n    *   Postural instability (HP:0002172).\n    *   Cognitive decline (HP:0100543).\n    *   Microcephaly (HP:0000252).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically in infancy or childhood for epilepsy and neurodevelopmental phenotypes. A distinct adult-onset phenotype including obesity and a neurodegenerative PSP-like syndrome has also been described.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype is broad, ranging from individuals with mild features or favorable-outcome epilepsy to those with severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Adults may present with a milder neurodevelopmental phenotype or no obvious neurodevelopmental features.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** De novo protein-truncating variants (PTVs) are associated with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by epilepsy, developmental delay, obesity, and behavioral issues. Biallelic missense variants have been linked to a more severe epileptic phenotype with neurodevelopmental delay.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Pathogenic missense variants causing epilepsy with a favorable outcome have been reported to cluster at the C-terminus of the Bassoon protein, suggesting a specific subregional effect.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Evidence suggests a moderate correlation, where the severity and type of phenotype can be linked to the variant type (e.g., monoallelic missense vs. biallelic missense vs. truncating variants).\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** Biallelic variants, including a deletion (p.Leu1454del) and a missense variant (p.Ala3642Val), were associated with frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delay, and microcephaly. Monoallelic missense variants were associated with benign epilepsy.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   This section requires a comprehensive table populated from ClinVar and literature, which is beyond the scope of a static summary. Representative examples are provided below based on available search results.\n*   **c.3322G>T (p.Glu1108Ter):** De novo nonsense variant; reported in a patient with infantile-onset epilepsy with febrile seizures but normal development.\n*   **c.7351C>T (p.Gln2451Ter):** De novo nonsense variant; reported in a patient with childhood-onset epilepsy, febrile seizures, and normal development.\n*   **p.Pro3520Leu & p.Thr3658Ser:** Two separate heterozygous missense variants; associated with epilepsy with a favorable outcome.\n*   **p.Leu1454del & p.Ala3642Val:** Compound heterozygous variants; associated with frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delay, and microcephalus.\n*   **MyGene2 Candidate 4093:** De novo variant of unknown type; listed as \"Suspected pathogenic\".\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** BSN is highly expressed in the brain, with highest expression levels in the cerebellum, cerebellar hemisphere, cortex, and caudate nucleus. This aligns with the provided existing data.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high and specific expression in multiple brain regions, including the cortex and hippocampus, is consistent with the observed neurological phenotypes such as epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and behavioral disorders.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** BSN expression is significantly higher during infancy and decreases in adolescence and adulthood, which may correlate with the typical infancy/childhood onset of epilepsy.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** BSN encodes Bassoon, a large scaffolding protein that organizes the presynaptic cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) to regulate synaptic vesicle trafficking and neurotransmitter release.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Haploinsufficiency due to protein-truncating variants is a primary mechanism, leading to a loss of function. Some missense variants may also lead to loss of function, while others could have dominant-negative effects.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the presynaptic active zone impairs the integrity and function of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, leading to cortical hyperexcitability and seizures. In a separate mechanism, mutated BSN has been shown to lose its ability to reduce tau protein accumulation, potentially leading to tauopathy and neurodegeneration.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Bassoon functions in a complex with other CAZ proteins like Piccolo, Munc13, and RIMs. Its interaction with P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels is crucial for normal neurotransmitter release.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The exact diagnostic yield is not specified in the search results, but BSN is an emerging candidate gene found in epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorder cohorts via large-scale sequencing.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for BSN variants is indicated in individuals with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those with epilepsy (especially infantile or childhood-onset), developmental delay, and behavioral abnormalities.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** A genetic diagnosis can help predict the clinical course, with some genotypes suggesting a more favorable epilepsy outcome. Management is currently symptomatic, focusing on seizure control and supportive therapies for developmental delays.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the variable expressivity and wide phenotypic spectrum. Inheritance patterns can be autosomal dominant (often de novo) or recessive, impacting recurrence risk counseling for families.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 38896942 (2025):** Established that de novo disruptive BSN variants cause a synaptic disorder with a broad neurodevelopmental phenotype including epilepsy, developmental delay, obesity, and behavioral issues in a cohort of 29 individuals.\n*   **PMID: 32620603 (2020):** Identified BSN variants in eight families with epilepsy, suggesting a favorable outcome for many. It established the gene-disease relationship as \"strong\" and reported both de novo and recessive inheritance patterns, correlating phenotype severity with genotype.\n*   **PMID: 34168087 (2021):** Linked protein-truncating variants in BSN to severe adult-onset obesity, type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver disease, expanding the phenotype to include metabolic disorders.\n*   **PMID: 29335607 (2018):** Reported missense mutations in BSN in a family with a progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)-like syndrome, identifying a novel tauopathy and linking BSN to neurodegenerative disease through impaired reduction of tau accumulation.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   De novo protein-truncating variants are strongly associated with a phenotype that includes Seizures (HP:0001250), Global developmental delay (HP:0001263), and Obesity (HP:0001513).\n    *   Biallelic missense variants are associated with a more severe epilepsy phenotype and Microcephaly (HP:0000252).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of infantile/childhood-onset epilepsy (especially with febrile seizures), significant behavioral issues like disinhibition, and emerging obesity should raise strong suspicion for a pathogenic variant in BSN.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype overlaps with numerous other genetic causes of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Genes involved in presynaptic function and other forms of genetic epilepsy should be considered.\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in BSN (2/2):\nN/A.

        "CEP89": "CEP89 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 25907.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 615470.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Mitochondrial Complex IV Deficiency, Nuclear Type; Intellectual disability and multisystemic disorders.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for a role in disease is moderate, with some sources classifying it as \"Amber\" (moderate evidence) due to the limited number of reported cases. A homozygous deletion involving *CEP89* was identified in a patient with a complex phenotype, providing the primary evidence for its disease association.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The observed inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive, specifically biallelic loss-of-function.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI of 0.00, a LOEUF of 1.13, pRec of 0.81, and pNull of 0.19.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores suggest that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This indicates that haploinsufficiency is not a likely disease mechanism. The high pRec score suggests a higher probability of being associated with recessive disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Homozygous deletions or biallelic loss-of-function variants (e.g., nonsense, frameshift) are the most likely pathogenic variant classes, consistent with a recessive inheritance pattern.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Intellectual disability (HP:0001249).\n    *   Cytochrome-c oxidase deficiency (HP:0008347).\n    *   Cystinuria (HP:0003387).\n    *   Cataract (HP:0000518).\n    *   Deafness / Hearing impairment (HP:0000365).\n    *   Broad-based gait (HP:0002136).\n    *   Developmental delay.\n    *   Hypotonia (HP:0001252).\n    *   Muscle weakness (HP:0001324).\n    *   Hepatomegaly (HP:0002240).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Exercise intolerance (HP:0003546).\n    *   Delayed motor development.\n    *   Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HP:0001639).\n    *   Liver dysfunction.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Clinical features can be identified in childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype associated with biallelic *CEP89* deletion is severe, involving multisystemic and neurological problems.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** A homozygous deletion of *CEP89* (along with *SLC7A9*) was associated with a complex phenotype including intellectual disability, mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, cataracts, deafness, ataxia, and cystinuria. The cystinuria is attributed to the *SLC7A9* deletion, while the other features are likely due to the loss of *CEP89*.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The CEP89 protein contains coiled-coil domains and a potential mitochondrial-targeting signal. Disruption of these domains through variants is expected to impact its function in ciliogenesis and mitochondrial metabolism.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is currently based on a single well-documented case, making the strength moderate until additional cases are reported.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   As of now, the primary reported pathogenic event is a large homozygous deletion on chromosome 19q13.11, encompassing both *CEP89* and the adjacent *SLC7A9* gene. Specific pathogenic point variants or small indels in *CEP89* are not yet well-characterized in ClinVar with \"Pathogenic\" assertions.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, *CEP89* shows broad expression, with notable levels in the testis, cerebellum, and frontal cortex. Other sources mention expression in the nervous system, intestine, and blood.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its role in mitochondrial function and ciliogenesis, and its expression in the brain, dysfunction is expected to lead to neurological phenotypes like intellectual disability and ataxia. Expression in other tissues aligns with the observed multisystemic issues.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The gene is expressed in the fetal ventricular zone and ganglionic eminence, suggesting a role in brain development. This aligns with the developmental delay and intellectual disability phenotypes.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** CEP89 is required for ciliogenesis and also plays a role in mitochondrial metabolism, where it may modulate the activity of mitochondrial complex IV.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is loss-of-function, consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The homozygous deletion resulted in a lack of functional CEP89 protein.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of *CEP89* impairs the assembly and activity of mitochondrial complex IV, leading to decreased ATP production. This mitochondrial dysfunction underlies the neurological and muscular symptoms. Its role in ciliogenesis suggests that ciliary defects may also contribute to the pleiotropic phenotype.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** CEP89 localizes to the centrosome and colocalizes with the distal appendage protein CEP164, indicating a role in centriole and cilium structure. It is also found in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for *CEP89* variants is currently very low, as pathogenic variants have only been reported in a single case.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for *CEP89* would be considered in individuals presenting with a combination of intellectual disability, mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, and other features of the reported phenotype like cataracts, deafness, and ataxia, particularly if cystinuria is also present (suggesting a contiguous gene deletion).\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are currently no specific therapies targeting CEP89 deficiency. Management is supportive and focuses on the individual's symptoms, such as educational support for intellectual disability and monitoring of mitochondrial and organ function.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For parents of an affected individual, the recurrence risk for future pregnancies is 25%, consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. Carrier testing for at-risk family members would be possible once the specific pathogenic variants are identified.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 23575228, 2013:** This landmark paper first described a patient with a homozygous deletion of *CEP89* and *SLC7A9*. It established the link between *CEP89* loss-of-function and a phenotype of isolated complex IV deficiency, intellectual disability, cataract, deafness, and ataxia. Using a *Drosophila* model, the study demonstrated that Cep89 is crucial for mitochondrial integrity, complex IV activity, and neuronal function.\n*   **PMID: 35029312, 2022:** This study investigated the role of *CEP89* in ovarian cancer, finding that increased copy number and expression are associated with a poor prognosis. While focused on oncology, it highlights the gene's role in cellular processes that can be relevant to both cancer and developmental disorders.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** A homozygous deletion of *CEP89* is strongly associated with a syndromic presentation including **Intellectual disability (HP:0001249)**, **Cytochrome-c oxidase deficiency (HP:0008347)**, **Cataract (HP:0000518)**, and **Hearing impairment (HP:0000365)**.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The co-occurrence of mitochondrial complex IV deficiency with intellectual disability and the specific constellation of cataracts, deafness, and ataxia should raise strong suspicion for *CEP89* defects, especially if accompanied by cystinuria (which points to a contiguous gene deletion with *SLC7A9*).\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype overlaps with other mitochondrial disorders caused by defects in complex IV assembly factors or other genes involved in mitochondrial function. It also shares features with ciliopathies, given the gene's role in ciliogenesis. Therefore, genes associated with Leigh syndrome, other complex IV deficiencies, and syndromic ciliopathies should be considered.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in CEP89 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "CHRNA7": "CHRNA7 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: CHRNA7**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 1960.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 118511.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (OMIM #612001) is the primary disease associated with alterations in *CHRNA7*. The gene is also implicated in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The role of *CHRNA7* deletion in the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome phenotype is well-established. However, the pathogenicity of duplications is less certain due to variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, though many cases arise *de novo*. Duplications are more frequently inherited from an unaffected parent, complicating clinical interpretation.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Based on gnomAD v2.1.1, *CHRNA7* has a probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score of 0.00, indicating it is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction (LOEUF) score is 1.08. The gene is not predicted to be associated with recessive disease (pRec = 0.02).\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores suggest that heterozygous loss-of-function point mutations within the general population are tolerated and that haploinsufficiency from sequence variants is not a common disease mechanism. This contrasts with the known pathogenicity of whole-gene deletions via CNV.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Copy number variations (CNVs), specifically microdeletions encompassing the entire gene, are the primary pathogenic variant class. The role of individual missense or nonsense variants is less clear, though rare promoter variants that reduce transcription have been noted in ASD cases.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Intellectual disability (HP:0001249).\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0100711).\n    *   Hypotonia (HP:0001252).\n    *   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (HP:0007018).\n    *   Schizophrenia (HP:0100753).\n    *   Developmental regression (HP:0002376).\n    *   Motor delay (HP:0001270).\n    *   Anxiety (HP:0000739).\n    *   Aggressive behavior (HP:0100718).\n    *   Short stature (HP:0004322).\n    *   Mood disorders (HP:0000708).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Obsessive-compulsive behavior (HP:0000722).\n    *   Bipolar disorder (HP:0007302).\n    *   Tourette syndrome (HP:0001282).\n    *   Abnormality of brain morphology (HP:0002011).\n    *   Dyslexia (HP:0002336).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes are typically identified in childhood due to the presentation of developmental delay, intellectual disability, and seizures. Neuropsychiatric features like schizophrenia may manifest in adolescence or early adulthood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The clinical presentation is highly variable. Deletions generally cause more severe and highly penetrant phenotypes compared to duplications. Individuals with zero to four copies of *CHRNA7* have been reported, showing a range of clinical severity.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Deletions (Haploinsufficiency):** Heterozygous deletions are strongly associated with intellectual disability, seizures, and developmental delay (15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome).\n    *   **Duplications:** Associated with a wider, more variable spectrum of neuropsychiatric phenotypes including ASD, ADHD, schizophrenia, and mood disorders. Penetrance is incomplete and expressivity is highly variable.\n    *   **Triplications:** A three-generation family with *CHRNA7* triplication displayed various neuropsychiatric phenotypes, including anxiety, bipolar disorder, and developmental delay, providing further evidence for dosage sensitivity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between 15q13.3 microdeletions and a core phenotype of ID, epilepsy, and developmental delay is strong. The correlation for duplications and neuropsychiatric disorders is considered moderate due to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** The phenotype is primarily linked to copy number of the entire gene rather than specific intragenic variants. The 1.5 Mb deletion at 15q13.3 (Type 1) is the recurrent CNV encompassing *CHRNA7* that causes the associated syndrome.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\nGiven that the primary pathogenic mechanism is CNV, a list of single nucleotide variants is not the most clinically relevant representation. The critical pathogenic variant is the recurrent microdeletion at chromosome 15q13.3.\n*   **Variant:** nsv469778 (representative of the 1.5 Mb 15q13.3 microdeletion).\n*   **Type:** Copy number loss / deletion.\n*   **ClinVar Significance:** Pathogenic.\n*   **Reported Phenotypes:** Intellectual disability (HP:0001249), Seizures (HP:0001250), Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750), Hypotonia (HP:0001252), Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0100711).\n*   **AF:** Frequency in the general population is low, but it is one of the more common pathogenic CNVs.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, *CHRNA7* shows notable expression in the brain (especially cerebellum), adrenal gland, and pituitary gland. It is also expressed in the lung, spleen, and skin.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the brain, particularly the hippocampus, aligns with the observed neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric phenotypes like cognitive deficits, seizures, learning, and memory problems. Expression in immune cells is relevant to its role in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The gene is critical during neurodevelopment, which explains the childhood onset of many associated phenotypes. Its ongoing role in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter release throughout life contributes to the manifestation of psychiatric disorders in adolescence and adulthood.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The *CHRNA7* gene encodes the alpha-7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17-nAChR), a ligand-gated ion channel that, upon binding acetylcholine, opens to allow the influx of cations, including a high permeability to calcium.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:**\n    *   **Haploinsufficiency:** Deletion of one copy of *CHRNA7* leads to a reduced dosage of the \u03b17-nAChR protein, which is the primary mechanism for 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome.\n    *   **Gene Dosage Effect:** Both deletions and duplications/triplications result in altered gene dosage, demonstrating that the human brain is highly sensitive to the amount of *CHRNA7* product. Unexpectedly, both deletions and duplications have been shown to lead to decreased \u03b17-nAChR-associated calcium flux in cellular models.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of *CHRNA7* impacts cholinergic synaptic transmission and calcium signaling. This impairs neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal excitability, leading to cognitive deficits (learning/memory), seizures, and behavioral abnormalities. The gene is also a key component of the \"cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway,\" which modulates systemic inflammation.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The partially duplicated gene *CHRFAM7A* can form a hybrid transcript that acts as a dominant-negative regulator of \u03b17-nAChR function, reducing the number of functional receptors and potentially modifying the phenotype.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Deletions of *CHRNA7* are found in approximately 1% of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsies. The 15q13.3 microdeletion is a recurrent finding in cohorts of individuals with intellectual disability, ASD, and schizophrenia.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for *CHRNA7* CNVs (via chromosomal microarray) is indicated for patients with unexplained intellectual disability, developmental delay, seizures, autism spectrum disorder, or schizophrenia.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identification of a pathogenic *CHRNA7* CNV confirms a genetic diagnosis, allowing for anticipatory guidance and management of associated features like seizures and developmental delays. It can also inform prognosis and family planning.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the concepts of autosomal dominant inheritance, *de novo* occurrence, incomplete penetrance, and variable expressivity, particularly for duplications. The possibility of an unaffected carrier parent must be discussed.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Sharp, A.J. et al. (2008). *Nat Genet*. PMID: 18536732.** A landmark paper that first described the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome as a novel recurrent genomic disorder associated with ID and epilepsy, identifying *CHRNA7* as a key candidate gene.\n*   **van Bon, B.W.M. et al.

PMID: 28932289.** This study detailed the clinical and behavioral phenotypes of 18 children with *CHRNA7* duplications, emphasizing the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance.\n*   **Masi, A. et al. (2015). *Am J Med Genet B*. PMID: 25656121.** This was the first study to perform sequence variant analysis of *CHRNA7* in an ASD cohort, highlighting the technical challenges due to the *CHRFAM7A* fusion gene and identifying rare, functional promoter variants.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   A heterozygous microdeletion of *CHRNA7* is strongly associated with a core phenotype of Intellectual disability (HP:0001249), Seizures (HP:0001250), and Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   A heterozygous microduplication of *CHRNA7* is associated with a broader, more variable phenotype that includes Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0100711), ADHD (HP:0007018), and Schizophrenia (HP:0100753), but with incomplete penetrance.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of intellectual disability, early-onset seizures (especially idiopathic generalized epilepsy), and features of ASD should strongly suggest testing for a 15q13.3 CNV involving *CHRNA7*.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome overlaps with other genomic disorders and epilepsy syndromes. The broad neuropsychiatric phenotypes seen with *CHRNA7* duplications overlap with numerous other genetic and multifactorial conditions.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in CHRNA7 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "MAML1": "MAML1 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **MAML1 Gene Dossier**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:13632\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 605424\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While not linked to a single Mendelian disorder, MAML1 is associated with susceptibility to Glioma Susceptibility 1 and Prostate Cancer. Mouse models indicate a critical role in muscle development, with knockout mice exhibiting severe muscular dystrophy.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance for specific variants varies, with many classified as variants of uncertain significance. However, its essential role in the Notch signaling pathway suggests a strong potential for pathogenic variants to cause disease.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** While Mendelian inheritance patterns are not clearly defined for a specific MAML1-related syndrome, heterozygous loss-of-function is suggested by mouse models showing that haploinsufficiency leads to a reduction in marginal zone B cells.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics for MAML1 (transcript ENST00000292634.9) are: pLI = 0.00, LOEUF = 1.15. The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) is low, suggesting the gene is not highly constrained against protein-truncating variants. The observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is also not indicative of strong constraint.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in MAML1 are generally tolerated in the general population and the gene is not under strong purifying selection against truncation.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While truncating variants may be tolerated, missense variants or variants that have a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect could be pathogenic, given the gene's role as a transcriptional coactivator in a multi-protein complex.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As MAML1 is not definitively linked to a single Mendelian disease, a ranked list of HPO terms is not well-established. However, based on its function and mouse models, relevant HPO terms would relate to muscular dystrophy and immune system abnormalities.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Potential secondary HPO terms could involve abnormalities in organ systems where Notch signaling is crucial, such as the cardiovascular and skeletal systems.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Mouse models with a MAML1 knockout die in the perinatal period, suggesting that severe loss-of-function mutations would likely manifest prenatally or in infancy.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype in mouse models is severe and lethal when the gene is knocked out, but heterozygous mice are viable with more subtle phenotypes, suggesting a spectrum from severe to mild depending on the nature and dosage of the variant.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous loss-of-function in mice results in severe muscular dystrophy and perinatal lethality. Heterozygous loss-of-function (haploinsufficiency) in mice leads to a reduction in marginal zone B-cells, indicating a role in the immune system.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The N-terminal region of MAML1 is essential for its interaction with Notch receptors and for its role in myogenesis. Mutations in this domain would likely disrupt these functions. The C-terminal region contains transactivation domains crucial for activating gene expression.\n*   **Genotype-phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between homozygous loss-of-function and muscular dystrophy in mice is strong. The correlation for heterozygous variants in humans is less clear and likely context-dependent.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   ClinVar lists a number of variants in MAML1, with the majority classified as \"Uncertain significance\". Specific pathogenic variants with well-defined phenotypes are not extensively documented in the literature. One example includes:\n    *   **NM_014757.5(MAML1):c.2713C>G (p.Pro905Ala):** Classified as a variant of uncertain significance.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** MAML1 is widely expressed, with the highest levels in the spleen, whole blood, and small intestine (terminal ileum). Expression is also noted in the heart and pancreas.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in immune cells (spleen, blood) aligns with the observed B-cell development defects in mice. Expression in the heart and muscle is consistent with the muscular dystrophy phenotype in knockout mice and its role in myogenesis.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** MAML1 is dynamically expressed during development in structures like the brain, spinal cord, and somites, highlighting its importance in embryogenesis.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** MAML1 acts as a transcriptional coactivator for Notch proteins, forming a complex with the Notch intracellular domain and the DNA-binding protein RBP-Jkappa to activate the transcription of Notch target genes.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Based on mouse models, both haploinsufficiency and complete loss-of-function can lead to disease phenotypes. Dominant-negative effects are also possible, as truncated mutants can inhibit myogenesis.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the Notch signaling pathway affects cell fate determination. MAML1 also coactivates other key pathways, including MEF2C (essential for muscle development), p53, and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, explaining the pleiotropic effects of its disruption.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** MAML1 interacts directly with all four NOTCH receptors, RBPJ, MEF2C, p53, and \u03b2-catenin. These interactions are crucial for its function in various signaling pathways.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for MAML1 variants in patients with undiagnosed diseases is likely low, given the lack of a well-defined, associated Mendelian disease.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for MAML1 may be considered in patients with unexplained muscular dystrophies or complex developmental disorders where disruption of the Notch pathway is suspected, especially if other more common genetic causes have been ruled out.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, management would be supportive and based on the patient's specific phenotypes. There are no targeted therapies for MAML1-related conditions.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the uncertain clinical significance of most variants and the lack of a clear inheritance pattern for a specific disease, genetic counseling would be complex. Counseling would focus on the gene's function, the uncertainty of the variant's impact, and the potential for variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Wu L, et al. (2000) *Nature Genetics*.** First identified and cloned human MAML1, establishing it as a transcriptional coactivator for all four NOTCH receptors, localizing to nuclear bodies and amplifying NOTCH-induced transcription.\n*   **Shen H, et al. (2006) *Genes & Development*.** Demonstrated that MAML1 is essential for myogenesis by functioning as a coactivator for MEF2C, and that MAML1 knockout mice have severe muscular dystrophy.\n*   **Oyama T, et al. (2007) *Blood*.** Showed that Maml1 is required for Notch2-mediated marginal zone B-cell development and that haploinsufficiency leads to a reduction in these cells, indicating a gene-dosage effect.\n*   **Wilson JJ, et al. (2020) *Molecular and Cellular Biology*.** Revealed differential requirements for MAML1 at different Notch-responsive genes, highlighting the complexity of its transcriptional coactivator function.\n*   **Pistollato F, et al. (2017) *Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine*.** Reviewed the diverse roles of MAML1 beyond the Notch pathway, implicating it in Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, p53, and other signaling networks relevant to development and cancer.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence associations between specific MAML1 variants and specific HPO terms in humans.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** A combination of muscular dystrophy (e.g., HP:0003560 Muscular dystrophy) and an immunodeficiency phenotype (e.g., HP:0002721 Immunodeficiency) could be a red flag, though this is based on mouse model data.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The potential muscular phenotype overlaps with numerous other congenital muscular dystrophies. The immunodeficiency phenotype would need to be distinguished from other primary immunodeficiencies. The broad role of Notch signaling means phenotypes could overlap with other \"Notchopathies\" like Alagille syndrome.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in MAML1 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "NUP153": "NUP153 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n\u2013 **HGNC ID**: 8062\n\u2013 **OMIM Gene ID**: 603948\n\u2013 **Primary Disease Associations**: While not linked to a specific Mendelian disease, NUP153 is associated with several complex conditions, including certain cancers and potentially cardiomyopathy. Increased expression has been noted in various cancers, such as gastric, colorectal, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. It has also been implicated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, it has been associated with adult human height and childhood obesity in Hispanic populations.\n\u2013 **Clinical Significance Level**: The clinical significance is currently considered limited or evolving for Mendelian disorders, as no specific single-gene disorder has been definitively attributed to NUP153 variants.\n\u2013 **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients**: No clear inheritance pattern for a specific disease has been established. One case report identified a rare, potentially pathogenic heterozygous variant in a patient with spermatogenic failure, but the patient also had a homozygous loss-of-function variant in another gene (NUP210L).\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\u2013 **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI score of 1.00, suggesting extreme intolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is 0.24, which is below the recommended threshold of < 0.35, also indicating intolerance to LoF variants.\n\u2013 **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The high pLI and low LOEUF scores suggest that NUP153 is highly constrained against protein-truncating variants and that haploinsufficiency is a potential disease mechanism. Genes with high constraint are more likely to be associated with dominant diseases.\n\u2013 **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Given the high intolerance to LoF variation, nonsense and frameshift variants are most likely to be pathogenic. Missense variants in highly constrained regions could also be considered potentially pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\nDue to the lack of a defined Mendelian disease association, a comprehensive HPO term list is not available. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for clinical abnormalities. Phenotypes are currently linked to NUP153's role in broader disease processes rather than a specific syndrome.\n\u2013 **Primary Phenotypes Implicated**:\n  \u2013 **Oncology**: Associated with increased proliferation and poor prognosis in some cancers, particularly gastric cancer.\n  \u2013 **Cardiomyopathy**: Upregulation is linked to dilated cardiomyopathy in the context of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\n  \u2013 **Infertility**: A potential heterozygous role in male infertility has been suggested.\n\u2013 **Age of Onset Patterns**: Not applicable in the context of a specific Mendelian disorder.\n\u2013 **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Not applicable in the context of a specific Mendelian disorder.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\u2013 **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: There is currently insufficient data to correlate specific variant classes with distinct phenotypes.\n\u2013 **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: The C-terminal FG-repeat domain is crucial for interactions with transport receptors, and its disruption could affect nucleocytoplasmic transport. The N-terminal domain is involved in binding to the nuclear pore basket. A rescue experiment for mitotic defects showed that the FG-rich region was necessary to resolve issues in late mitosis, while defects in early mitosis were independent of this domain.\n\u2013 **Genotype-phenotype Correlation Strength**: Weak, as no definitive correlations have been established.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\nThere are no well-characterized pathogenic variants with established disease causality in ClinVar.\n\u2013 Variants of Uncertain Significance have been reported. For example:\n  \u2013 **NM_005124.4(NUP153):c.433G>A (p.Ala145Thr)**: Reported as a variant of uncertain significance.\n  \u2013 **NM_005124.4(NUP153):c.2876T>G (p.Phe959Cys)**: Reported as a variant of uncertain significance.\n\u2013 A rare heterozygous variant (**p.Pro485Leu**) was identified in a patient with severe sperm head morphology defects, but its pathogenicity is unclear as the patient also had a homozygous mutation in *NUP210L*.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\u2013 **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM)**: NUP153 shows broad expression across many tissues. According to the Human Protein Atlas, which utilizes GTEx data, high RNA expression is observed in lymphoid tissues like the spleen and lymph nodes, as well as in the testis, placenta, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\n\u2013 **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**:\n  \u2013 **Heart**: Overexpression in cardiac tissue is linked to cardiomyopathy, potentially through altered calcium channel expression and function.\n  \u2013 **Testis**: High expression in the testis may relate to its potential role in spermatogenesis.\n  \u2013 **Immune cells**: Broad expression in immune cells suggests a role in immune function.\n\u2013 **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: NUP153 is involved in cell cycle progression, particularly during mitosis. Its role in neurogenesis has been explored in mouse models.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\u2013 **Normal Gene Function**: NUP153 is a key component of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), acting as a scaffold and playing a crucial role in regulating the transport of proteins and mRNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm.\n\u2013 **Disease Mechanism**: While not definitively established for a Mendelian disease, potential mechanisms include haploinsufficiency, given the high constraint against LoF variants. In cancer, the mechanism appears to be related to overexpression leading to increased cell proliferation and altered signaling pathways like TGF-\u03b2.\n\u2013 **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**:\n  \u2013 **Nucleocytoplasmic Transport**: Disruption affects the movement of macromolecules, which is fundamental to cellular homeostasis.\n  \u2013 **Cell Cycle Regulation**: NUP153 depletion can lead to mitotic delays, defects in spindle checkpoint activity, and the formation of multilobed nuclei, impacting cell division.\n  \u2013 **Gene Expression Regulation**: Nup153 can associate with chromatin and regulate the expression of specific genes, such as those involved in cardiac remodeling.\n\u2013 **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: NUP153 interacts with TPR and NUP50 to form the nuclear basket. It also interacts with transport receptors and cell cycle proteins like Mad1. Its interaction with Kif1a is important for nuclear migration in brain progenitor cells.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\u2013 **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: Currently, the diagnostic yield for NUP153 variants in clinical cohorts for a specific Mendelian disorder is effectively zero, as it is not yet associated with one.\n\u2013 **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: Testing is not routinely performed for Mendelian disease diagnosis. It is more commonly studied in cancer research contexts to understand its role in tumor progression and as a potential biomarker.\n\u2013 **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: There is no specific clinical actionability based on germline NUP153 variants at this time. In oncology, its expression level may have prognostic value in some cancers, like gastric cancer.\n\u2013 **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling would focus on the uncertain significance of any identified variants and the lack of a clear disease association. The high constraint scores could be discussed as suggestive of the gene's importance, but without a known phenotype, this information has limited clinical utility.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\u2013 **PMID: 28513807, 2017**: Found that Nup153 is upregulated and acetylated in the hearts of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients and mdx mice, where it acts as an epigenetic regulator of genes involved in cardiac remodeling.\n\u2013 **PMID: 19168798, 2009**: Showed that depletion of Nup153 in HeLa cells leads to distinct mitotic defects, including delays in late mitosis and the formation of multilobed nuclei, revealing separable roles for the protein in mitotic progression.\n\u2013 **PMID: 29775390, 2018**: Demonstrated that Nup153 regulates tumor cell migration and proliferation and is involved in the nuclear import of key proteins in prostate cancer cells.\n\u2013 **Front Immunol, 2025**: A pan-cancer analysis highlighted that high NUP153 expression is linked to poor prognosis in several cancers and plays a role in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment.\n\u2013 **Clin Genet, 2024**: A case study identified a rare heterozygous NUP153 variant in a patient with male infertility, suggesting a possible, though unconfirmed, link.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\u2013 **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: Currently, there are no high-confidence associations between specific NUP153 variants and HPO terms.\n\u2013 **Phenotype red flags**: There are no established \"red flag\" HPO terms that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in NUP153 at this time.\n\u2013 **Differential diagnosis considerations**: Given the association with cardiomyopathy, it could be considered in the differential for dilated cardiomyopathy, though many other genes have a more established role. For nephrotic syndrome, other nucleoporin genes like *NUP93* and *NUP133* are known causes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in NUP153 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "AHNAK2": "AHNAK2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 20125.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 608570.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** The primary disease association for AHNAK2 is with an autosomal recessive form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It is also implicated as an oncogene in several cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer, and uveal melanoma.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for its role in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is currently classified as \"Limited\" by the Gene Curation Coalition (GenCC). Its association with various cancers is established through multiple expression and prognostic studies.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** For Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, the observed inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. In the context of cancer, its role is related to somatic expression levels rather than inheritance.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Based on gnomAD v2.1.1, the pLI score for AHNAK2 is 0.00, suggesting it is not extremely intolerant of protein-truncating variants. The observed/expected (o/e) score for loss-of-function (LoF) variants is 1.04. The pRec score is 0.000 and the pNull score is 1.00.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and o/e close to 1.0 indicate that the gene is tolerant to heterozygous loss-of-function variants in the general population. This is consistent with a recessive inheritance pattern for its associated Mendelian disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For its role in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, biallelic variants (homozygous or compound heterozygous), including missense and frameshift mutations, are implicated. In cancer, overexpression (gain-of-function) is the primary oncogenic mechanism.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** Limited information is available linking specific HPO terms directly to AHNAK2 variants in large cohorts. However, based on case reports for neurodevelopmental disorders, associated terms include Epilepsy (HP:0001250), Psychomotor development delay (HP:0001263), Hypotonia (HP:0001252), and congenital heart disease. For Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, expected terms would relate to peripheral neuropathy.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Additional features reported in a patient with compound heterozygous missense mutations included a cardio-facio-cutaneous-like phenotype, atopic dermatitis, and facial dysmorphism. Other reported features include abnormality of neuronal migration and skeletal deformities.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The age of onset for the reported neurodevelopmental phenotype with epilepsy was in childhood. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease typically manifests in the first or second decade of life. Cancer is typically a disease of adulthood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with AHNAK2 variants is not well established due to the limited number of reported cases. A case with a neurodevelopmental disorder was described as having a severe phenotype.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Autosomal recessive loss-of-function variants (missense, frameshift) have been associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and a cardio-facio-cutaneous-like syndrome with neurological involvement. Increased expression of AHNAK2 is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis in various cancers.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The AHNAK2 protein has a tripartite structure with an N-terminal PDZ-like domain, a large central repeat region, and a C-terminal domain. Specific correlations between variant location and phenotype have not yet been clearly established.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is currently considered moderate for its association with autosomal recessive neuropathies and neurodevelopmental disorders due to the small number of reported cases. The correlation between high expression and cancer prognosis is supported by numerous studies.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** Compound heterozygous missense mutations, c.1198G>A (p.Gly400Ser) and c.16379T>C (p.Ile5460Thr), were identified in a patient with a cardio-facio-cutaneous-like phenotype, epilepsy, and psychomotor delay.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No extensively characterized pathogenic variants with high-frequency reporting are available in ClinVar for Mendelian disease. The variants reported are primarily from individual case studies.\n*   **c.1198G>A (p.Gly400Ser) / missense / VUS:** Associated with a cardio-facio-cutaneous-like phenotype and epilepsy in a compound heterozygous state; allele frequency is not reported.\n*   **c.16379T>C (p.Ile5460Thr) / missense / VUS:** Found in a compound heterozygous state with the p.Gly400Ser variant in a patient with a CFC-like phenotype.\n*   A frameshift mutation has been linked to dysmorphic features and skeletal deformities.\n*   A missense variant, **c.2695G>T (p.Val899Leu) / VUS,** has been associated with an abnormality of neuronal migration.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, AHNAK2 shows the highest mRNA expression in the skin (both sun-exposed and non-sun-exposed areas). Protein expression is distinct in squamous epithelia, respiratory epithelia, smooth muscle, and neuropil.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Expression in the neuropil is consistent with the neurological phenotypes observed, such as peripheral neuropathy and neurodevelopmental disorders. High expression in various epithelial tissues aligns with its role in multiple adenocarcinomas.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** While specific developmental expression data is limited, its role in congenital heart disease and neurodevelopmental disorders suggests importance during embryogenesis.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The AHNAK2 gene encodes a very large nucleoprotein that may be involved in calcium signaling and the structural linkage of the muscle cell cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** For Mendelian disorders, the mechanism is likely loss-of-function in an autosomal recessive pattern. In cancer, the mechanism is gain-of-function, where overexpression promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** In cancer, AHNAK2 overexpression is linked to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, hypoxia-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the c-MET signaling pathway, leading to increased cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Its potential role in calcium signaling could underlie the neurological phenotypes.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** AHNAK2 is known to form homodimers via its PDZ-like domain. It interacts with fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) in a stress-induced secretion pathway and may interact with calcium channel proteins. In cancer, it can modulate the stability of the c-MET protein.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for AHNAK2 variants in cohorts with suspected hereditary disease is low. It has been identified as a candidate gene in studies of congenital heart disease and nephrotic syndrome, but its definitive causal role in these cohorts is not yet established.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for AHNAK2 may be considered in patients with clinical features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease where more common genetic causes have been excluded, or in individuals with complex neurodevelopmental syndromes.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** For patients with a diagnosis related to AHNAK2, management is supportive and based on the phenotype (e.g., physical therapy for neuropathy, anti-seizure medication for epilepsy). There are currently no targeted therapies for AHNAK2-related Mendelian disorders. In cancer, high AHNAK2 expression may serve as a poor prognostic marker.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For families with biallelic pathogenic variants, genetic counseling would focus on the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, with a 25% recurrence risk for future offspring.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 35789128, 2022:** Reported compound heterozygous missense mutations in a patient with a cardio-facio-cutaneous-like phenotype, epilepsy, and psychomotor developmental delay, expanding the known phenotypic spectrum.\n*   **PMID: 31215093, 2019:** First identified AHNAK2 as a novel genetic cause for autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease in a Malaysian family through linkage analysis and whole-exome sequencing.\n*   **PMID: 28600779, 2017:** A study on genetic diseases in Saudi Arabia identified a frameshift AHNAK2 mutation associated with dysmorphic features and skeletal deformities.\n*   **PMID: 28279935, 2017:** Demonstrated that AHNAK2 is upregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma, promotes tumorigenesis and progression, and is linked to the hypoxia pathway, suggesting it as a prognostic marker and oncogenic protein.\n*   **PMID: 32821425, 2020:** Showed AHNAK2 is upregulated and associated with poor prognosis and cell migration in lung adenocarcinoma.\n*   **PMID: 32968434, 2020:** A bioinformatic analysis identifying AHNAK2 as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for papillary thyroid carcinoma, potentially acting through immune-related pathways.\n*   **PMID: 36746884, 2023:** Found AHNAK2 promotes pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progression by stabilizing the c-MET protein, suggesting it as a therapeutic target.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations due to the limited number of reported cases. Existing evidence points to biallelic loss-of-function variants causing a spectrum of neurological disorders.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of a peripheral neuropathy (consistent with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) or a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with features like epilepsy, developmental delay, and congenital anomalies in a patient with biallelic variants in AHNAK2 should raise suspicion.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease caused by AHNAK2 overlaps with other forms of CMT. The reported cardio-facio-cutaneous-like syndrome overlaps with the RASopathies, though the inheritance pattern (autosomal recessive for AHNAK2) is a key differentiator.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in AHNAK2 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "MTUS1": "MTUS1 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 29789.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 609589.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While primarily studied in the context of cancer, particularly as a tumor suppressor in various cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma, breast, and colorectal cancer, emerging evidence suggests a role in other conditions. A *de novo* mutation has been associated with non-compaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for its role in cancer is substantial, though a definitive Mendelian disease association is still emerging. Its association with NVM is based on a single case study, suggesting a need for further research.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** The role in cancer is primarily linked to somatic mutations or downregulation. The reported case of NVM was due to a *de novo* mutation, implying a dominant effect.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull (gnomAD v2.1.1):**\n    *   **pLI:** 0.00\n    *   **LOEUF:** 1.13\n    *   **pRec:** 0.81\n    *   **pNull:** 0.19\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The gnomAD scores indicate that *MTUS1* is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. The very low pLI and high LOEUF suggest that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While the gene is tolerant of loss-of-function variants, specific missense variants or variants affecting particular isoforms may be pathogenic. In cancer, downregulation or mutations that alter protein function are implicated.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0000717 - Autistic disorder\n    *   HP:0030680 - Left ventricular noncompaction\n    *   HP:0100744 - Cardiac hypertrophy\n    *   HP:0002099 - Colonic neoplasm\n    *   HP:0003003 - Breast carcinoma\n    *   HP:0001407 - Hepatocellular carcinoma\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0002857 - Salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma\n    *   HP:0002863 - Pancreatic cancer\n    *   HP:0002664 - Neoplasm\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The association with NVM was identified in a familial case involving two sisters, suggesting a congenital or early-onset presentation. Cancer associations are typically adult-onset.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The clinical presentation can range from predisposition to various cancers to structural heart defects. The severity of the cardiac phenotype in the reported NVM case was significant.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Downregulation of *MTUS1* expression is frequently observed in various cancers, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. A specific *de novo* missense mutation (c.2617A->C) has been linked to NVM.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Different isoforms of *MTUS1* have distinct cellular localizations (mitochondrial, nuclear) and may have different functional roles, suggesting that variants affecting specific isoforms could lead to different phenotypes. For example, isoform 5 (ATIP3) localizes to the mitochondria and is implicated in tumor suppression.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between reduced *MTUS1* expression and cancer is moderate to strong across multiple studies. The correlation with NVM is currently based on a single family and is therefore considered preliminary.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.2617A->C (p.Thr873Pro) / not provided / Uncertain significance (reported as pathogenic in a single study) / Non-compaction of ventricular myocardium (HP:0030680) / Extremely rare, reported as de novo.** This variant was identified in a family with NVM and was shown in vitro to decrease microtubule stability.\n*   *ClinVar lists several variants in MTUS1, but the vast majority are classified as variants of uncertain significance or benign, consistent with the gnomAD constraint scores.*\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** *MTUS1* is widely expressed, with higher levels in tissues such as the artery (tibial), liver, and pancreas.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The expression in the heart is consistent with the reported cardiac phenotype (NVM). Its expression in the liver and pancreas aligns with its role in hepatocellular and pancreatic cancers. High expression in the brain, particularly the cerebellum, suggests a potential neurological function.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression of certain isoforms in the fetal brain suggests a role in development.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *MTUS1* encodes a microtubule-associated scaffold protein that plays a role in regulating cell proliferation, cell division, and microtubule stability.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** In cancer, the mechanism is primarily loss-of-function, acting as a tumor suppressor. The *de novo* mutation associated with NVM may act through a dominant-negative or gain-of-function mechanism, as it was shown to decrease microtubule stability.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **ERK Pathway:** *MTUS1* cooperates with the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AGTR2) to inhibit ERK signaling, thereby suppressing cell proliferation. Disruption of this can lead to uncontrolled cell growth in cancer.\n    *   **Microtubule Dynamics:** The protein (specifically the ATIP3 isoform) stabilizes microtubules. Alterations can affect cell division and migration.\n    *   **Rac1/Cdc42 Pathway:** The NVM-associated mutation was found to decrease phosphorylation of Rac1/Cdc42, affecting cell polarity and microtubule stability, which are crucial for myocardial development.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for *MTUS1* is not standard for most genetic disorders. Its primary relevance is in cancer genomics, where its expression level can have prognostic value. The diagnostic yield for Mendelian conditions like NVM is currently unknown but presumed to be very low.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is primarily done in a research context to investigate its role in cancer progression and as a potential biomarker. It may be included in large gene panels for cardiomyopathy.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Low *MTUS1* expression in some cancers is associated with a poorer prognosis. There are currently no specific therapies targeting *MTUS1*.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the limited evidence for a Mendelian disease association, counseling for variants in *MTUS1* is challenging. For the reported NVM case, the *de novo* nature of the variant implies a low recurrence risk for the parents, but a 50% risk for the affected individuals' offspring.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 27383921, 2016:** Identified an *Mtus1* splice variant as a novel inhibitory factor against cardiac hypertrophy in mice, showing it suppresses ERK signaling.\n*   **PMID: 31231454, 2019:** Reported a *de novo* c.2617A->C mutation in *MTUS1* in a family with non-compaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM), suggesting a potential role in cardiac development via the Rac1/Cdc42 pathway.\n*   **PMID: 35962436, 2022:** A comprehensive analysis suggesting *MTUS1* as a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for colorectal cancer, correlating its expression with immune infiltration.\n*   **PMID: 34125869, 2021:** An in-silico analysis of deleterious single nucleotide polymorphisms in *MTUS1*, highlighting potentially damaging variants and their association with various cancers.\n*   **PMID: 19574577, 2008:** Early paper describing *MTUS1* as a tumor suppressor gene in the 8p22 region, with multiple isoforms having distinct functions and tissue distributions.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for *MTUS1*. The link to cancer is primarily based on expression levels rather than specific germline variants.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** While evidence is still emerging, the co-occurrence of **Left ventricular noncompaction (HP:0030680)** with a novel, rare missense variant in *MTUS1* could be a red flag, warranting further investigation, particularly if the variant is predicted to be damaging.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of non-compaction of the ventricular myocardium has a broad differential diagnosis, including variants in genes such as *MYH7, MYBPC3, TTN*, and others associated with cardiomyopathies.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in MTUS1 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "FER1L6": "FER1L6 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 28065.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 620884.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While no definitive disease associations are listed in OMIM, FER1L6 is linked to Cerebellar Ataxia Type 43 and Autosomal Recessive Deafness 9 in some databases. However, these appear to be weaker associations pending further evidence.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance is currently not well-established for a specific Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Given the lack of a defined disease association, definitive inheritance patterns in patients have not been described.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD data for FER1L6 shows a pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) score close to 0, and a LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) score that is not indicative of strong constraint against loss-of-function variants. Specific numeric values from the latest gnomAD release should be consulted for the most current data.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and higher LOEUF scores suggest that the gene is not highly intolerant to loss-of-function variation. This implies that heterozygous loss-of-function variants may not be sufficient to cause a dominant disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Without a clear disease association, it is difficult to determine which variant classes are most likely to be pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As FER1L6 is not definitively linked to a human disease, a ranked list of HPO terms from clinical cases is not available. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for clinical abnormalities.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are currently documented in relation to FER1L6 variants in patients.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Information on the age of onset is not available due to the lack of a defined disease phenotype.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The spectrum of phenotype severity is unknown.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Studies on genotype-phenotype correlations for FER1L6 in humans are currently lacking.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** There is no information available on phenotype patterns related to specific protein domains of FER1L6.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlation is not established.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** No specific variant-to-phenotype examples in humans have been documented.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   ClinVar lists a number of variants in FER1L6, with the majority classified as benign or of uncertain significance. There are very few, if any, variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic with detailed phenotype information.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** FER1L6 shows the highest expression in the stomach, testis, transverse colon, and terminal ileum of the small intestine.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Based on expression data, phenotypes related to the gastrointestinal tract or male reproductive system could potentially be expected, but this is speculative.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Zebrafish studies show broad expression during early development, essential for skeletal and cardiac muscle formation. This suggests that developmental defects, particularly muscular or cardiac, could be a possibility if human loss-of-function has a similar effect.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** FER1L6 is a member of the ferlin family and is involved in membrane dynamics, such as vesicle trafficking and fusion, and appears to play a crucial role in skeletal and cardiac muscle development.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is unknown.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** In zebrafish, loss of Fer1l6 function leads to disorganized striated muscle, delayed heart development, and affects the expression of genes involved in muscle proliferation and differentiation. It colocalizes with syntaxin 4 and vinculin, and its C2 domains interact with lipid membranes, suggesting a role in membrane-related processes crucial for muscle development.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Interactions with syntaxin 4 and vinculin have been noted, which may be relevant to its function in muscle tissue.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for FER1L6 in clinical cohorts is essentially zero, as it is not currently considered a disease-causing gene for any specific disorder.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for this gene would likely only occur in a research setting or as part of a large gene panel where its significance is under investigation.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There is no known clinical actionability or specific management related to variants in FER1L6.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the lack of evidence for a disease association, genetic counseling would focus on the uncertainty of findings in this gene.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 30705128, 2019:** This zebrafish study is a key piece of literature, demonstrating that loss of Fer1l6 function leads to severe defects in skeletal and cardiac muscle development, including disorganized striated muscle and delayed heart development.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** There are currently no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for FER1L6.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** Based on animal model data, severe congenital myopathy (HP:0003741), cardiomyopathy (HP:0001638), or spinal curvature (HP:0002650, HP:0002751) could be considered theoretical red flags if observed in a patient with a rare, potentially damaging variant in FER1L6, warranting further research.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The hypothetical phenotypes could overlap with other congenital muscular dystrophies or myopathies. The other ferlin genes, such as *DYSF* (dysferlin) and *MYOF* (myoferlin), are associated with muscular dystrophies and could be part of a differential diagnosis if a muscular phenotype is present.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in FER1L6 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "NUTM2A": "NUTM2A Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: NUTM2A**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 23438.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** Data not found in search results.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Primarily associated with cancers through gene fusion events, including Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma and a variant of CIC-rearranged sarcoma.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence is currently centered on somatic fusion events in cancer; significance for germline disease is not well established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Not applicable in the context of somatic fusions; germline inheritance patterns have not been described.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Specific constraint scores for NUTM2A were not found in the search results. General information defines pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) scores close to 1 as indicating intolerance to protein-truncating variants. The LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) is a newer metric where lower values indicate intolerance.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** High pLI (\u22650.9) or low LOEUF scores suggest a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation and may be associated with dominant diseases or haploinsufficiency. The absence of specific scores for NUTM2A prevents a direct interpretation for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** In the context of its known disease association, the pathogenic variants are gene fusions (e.g., NUTM2A-CIC, YWHAE-NUTM2A), a type of structural variation. Information on the pathogenicity of germline nonsense, missense, or splice variants is not available.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As NUTM2A's primary association is with somatic cancers, a typical HPO phenotype spectrum for a Mendelian disorder is not established. Associated phenotypes are related to the cancer type.\n    *   Sarcoma (HP:0002856)\n    *   Endometrial stromal sarcoma (HP:0030146)\n    *   Undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Data not available.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The reported case of NUTM2A-CIC fusion sarcoma occurred in a 43-year-old woman. Endometrial stromal sarcomas involving YWHAE-NUTM2A fusions occur in adults.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Sarcomas involving NUTM2A fusions are described as clinically aggressive with a poor prognosis and potential for fatal outcomes.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Gene Fusions:** Specific fusions involving NUTM2A are linked to distinct cancer types. The YWHAE-NUTM2A fusion is characteristic of a high-grade subtype of endometrial stromal sarcoma. The NUTM2A-CIC fusion defines a genetically distinct variant of CIC-rearranged small round cell sarcoma.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Data not available.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Strong. Specific somatic fusion events are defining features of particular aggressive sarcomas.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   **YWHAE-NUTM2A/B fusion \u2192** High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma.\n    *   **NUTM2A exon 7-CIC exon 12 fusion \u2192** Aggressive, undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   The primary pathogenic variants are somatic gene fusions, not germline variants with rsIDs.\n    *   **HGVS:** NUTM2A-CIC fusion.\n    *   **ClinVar Significance:** Not applicable (somatic).\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma.\n    *   **AF:** Not applicable (somatic).\n*   The primary pathogenic variants are somatic gene fusions, not germline variants with rsIDs.\n    *   **HGVS:** YWHAE-NUTM2A fusion.\n    *   **ClinVar Significance:** Not applicable (somatic).\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes:** High-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma.\n    *   **AF:** Not applicable (somatic).\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** GTEx data indicates expression in various tissues, including the thyroid, esophagus mucosa, and tibial nerve. The relevance of this expression pattern to the development of sarcomas in other tissues is unclear.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The known phenotypes are tissue-specific cancers: endometrial stromal sarcoma arises in the uterus, and other sarcomas can arise in soft tissues.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Data not available.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The precise function of the NUTM2A protein is not well-described in the search results.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is gain-of-function resulting from the creation of a chimeric oncogene fusion protein (e.g., NUTM2A-CIC, YWHAE-NUTM2A).\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The NUTM2A-CIC fusion protein is considered an oncogene protein that drives the proliferation of undifferentiated small round tumor cells, leading to a clinically aggressive sarcoma. YWHAE-NUTM2A fusions are associated with high-grade tumors and may involve pathways related to cyclin D1.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The fusion of NUTM2A with proteins like CIC or YWHAE creates the pathogenic driver of the associated cancers.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for NUTM2A fusions is relevant for the differential diagnosis of specific sarcoma subtypes. For instance, an NGS-based assay demonstrated good sensitivity for detecting endometrial stromal sarcoma fusion transcripts.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is performed on tumor tissue to identify diagnostic and prognostic genetic markers in undifferentiated sarcomas or suspected high-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identifying a NUTM2A fusion can confirm a specific sarcoma diagnosis, which carries prognostic weight as these tumors are often aggressive. This information can guide treatment decisions, although specific targeted therapies were not detailed in the search results.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** As the known pathogenic variants are somatic, genetic counseling would focus on explaining the nature of the acquired genetic change in the tumor and the non-hereditary basis of the disease.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 28188754, 2017:** Described a novel NUTM2A-CIC fusion in a 43-year-old woman, defining a genetically distinct and aggressive variant of CIC-rearranged small round cell sarcoma.\n*   **PMID: 22456610, 2012:** Characterized the clinicopathologic features of endometrial stromal sarcomas with YWHAE-NUTM2A/B fusions, establishing them as histologically high-grade and clinically aggressive tumors.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   A **NUTM2A-CIC gene fusion** in tumor tissue is strongly associated with the phenotype of **undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma (HP:0030146)**.\n    *   A **YWHAE-NUTM2A gene fusion** in tumor tissue is strongly associated with **high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma**.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:**\n    *   The presence of an **undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma**, particularly one negative for other common fusion markers like ETV4, should raise suspicion for a CIC-related fusion, including NUTM2A-CIC.\n    *   A diagnosis of **endometrial stromal sarcoma** with high-grade, round-cell morphology is a strong indicator to test for a YWHAE-NUTM2A fusion.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of undifferentiated small round cell sarcoma overlaps with other sarcomas driven by different gene fusions. Therefore, molecular testing is essential to differentiate NUTM2A-CIC sarcoma from other entities within the \"CIC-rearranged sarcoma\" category.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in NUTM2A (1/1):\nN/A.

        "NUTM2D": "NUTM2D Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID, OMIM gene ID, primary disease associations**:\n    *   HGNC ID: 23447.\n    *   OMIM gene ID: There is currently no OMIM entry specifically for the NUTM2D gene.\n    *   Primary disease associations: Text mining has associated NUTM2D with Retinitis Pigmentosa.\n\n*   **Clinical significance level**: The clinical significance of NUTM2D is not yet definitively established due to a lack of extensive research and clinical case reports directly linking it to a specific Mendelian disorder.\n\n*   **Inheritance patterns observed in patients**: As there are no well-documented cases of Mendelian disease caused by NUTM2D variants, the inheritance patterns are unknown.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull (report exact numeric values)**:\n    *   As of recent gnomAD releases, specific constraint metrics like pLI and LOEUF are not available for NUTM2D.\n\n*   **Clinical interpretation of constraint scores**: The absence of constraint scores from gnomAD suggests that there is not enough data to confidently assess the gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variants. Generally, a pLI score \u2265 0.9 indicates a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function mutations. A low LOEUF score also indicates intolerance.\n\n*   **Variant classes most likely to be pathogenic**: Without established disease associations, the variant classes most likely to be pathogenic are unknown. For genes where haploinsufficiency is the mechanism, loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site mutations) are typically pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**:\n    *   There are no established HPO terms directly linked to NUTM2D in major databases like OMIM or ClinVar.

However, no phenotype patterns have been linked to variants within this or any other domain of the protein.\n\n*   **Genotype-phenotype correlation strength**: The strength of any genotype-phenotype correlation for NUTM2D is currently unknown.\n\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes**: There are no documented examples of specific NUTM2D variants leading to particular phenotypes.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   At present, there are no well-characterized pathogenic variants in NUTM2D with confirmed associations to specific phenotypes in ClinVar or other major databases.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest expressing tissues (GTEx TPM) and clinical correlation**:\n    *   NUTM2D shows ubiquitous expression, with the highest levels observed in the testis and brain. It is also expressed in various other tissues, including adrenal gland, muscle, pancreas, and stomach.\n    *   Expression has been noted in fetal tissues between 10 and 20 weeks of gestation.\n\n*   **Tissue-specific phenotypes expected**: Given its expression in the brain and retina, neurological or ophthalmological phenotypes could be anticipated if variants in this gene are found to be pathogenic. The association with Retinitis Pigmentosa from text-mining supports this.\n\n*   **Expression during development and age-related phenotypes**: Expression in fetal tissues suggests a potential role in development.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal gene function in one sentence**: NUTM2D is a protein-coding gene, but its specific function is not well-characterized.\n\n*   **Disease mechanism**: The potential disease mechanism (e.g., haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative, gain-of-function) is currently unknown.\n\n*   **Cellular/molecular pathways disrupted \u2192 phenotype consequences**: The cellular and molecular pathways involving NUTM2D have not been fully elucidated, and thus the consequences of their disruption are not known.\n\n*   **Protein-protein interactions relevant to phenotype**: While interaction databases exist, specific protein-protein interactions for NUTM2D that are relevant to a human phenotype have not been established.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic yield in clinical cohorts**: The diagnostic yield for NUTM2D is unknown as it is not typically included in standard clinical testing panels for specific disorders.\n\n*   **Most common reasons for testing this gene**: Currently, there are no common clinical indications for testing the NUTM2D gene.\n\n*   **Clinical actionability and management implications**: There is no information on clinical actionability or management related to NUTM2D variants.\n\n*   **Genetic counseling considerations**: Without known disease associations or inheritance patterns, specific genetic counseling considerations for NUTM2D cannot be formulated.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   Currently, there are no landmark clinical studies that have established a definitive link between NUTM2D variants and a human phenotype. Existing literature primarily consists of large-scale genomic studies and database entries.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: At this time, there are no high-confidence associations between HPO terms and NUTM2D variants.\n\n*   **Phenotype red flags**: There are currently no \"red flag\" HPO terms that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in NUTM2D.\n\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**: Given the text-mined association with Retinitis Pigmentosa, other genes known to cause this condition would be part of a differential diagnosis.

        "NACA": "NACA Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** NACA (HGNC:7629).\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 601234.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While directly causative links to a Mendelian disease are not yet firmly established, NACA has been associated with several conditions, including atopic dermatitis (as an IgE autoantigen), and has been implicated in congenital heart disease (CHD) and rhabdomyosarcoma. A genomic locus containing NACA was associated with increased myocardial mass.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance is currently considered limited or under investigation for most conditions. There are no definitive Mendelian disease associations established in OMIM.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Not applicable, as no Mendelian disease is definitively linked.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    *   **pLI (gnomAD v2.1.1):** 0.00 (This value indicates that the gene is not intolerant to loss-of-function variation).\n    *   **LOEUF (gnomAD v4.0):** The score is not prominently listed, but the recommendation is to use LOEUF as a continuous metric, with values < 0.6 suggesting intolerance to loss-of-function variation.\n    *   **pRec/pNull (gnomAD v2.1.1):** pRec is the probability of being intolerant of homozygous LoF variants, while pNull is the probability of being tolerant of both heterozygous and homozygous LoF variants. Specific values for NACA are not readily available in the search results.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI score suggests that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in NACA are tolerated in the general population and the gene is not under strong selection against this type of variation. This makes it less likely that haploinsufficiency is a common disease mechanism.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** While loss-of-function variants are not strongly constrained, specific missense variants or variants affecting regulatory regions could be pathogenic, potentially through dominant-negative or gain-of-function mechanisms, particularly in tissue-specific contexts like muscle or bone.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As there is no defined NACA-related Mendelian disorder, a ranked list of HPO terms is not applicable. However, based on its function and associations, relevant phenotypes would fall under the following categories:\n    *   **Musculoskeletal:** Abnormal muscle physiology (HP:0003198), Myopathy (HP:0003198), Abnormal bone structure (HP:0000928).\n    *   **Cardiac:** Cardiomyopathy (HP:0001638), Congenital heart defect (HP:0001627), Increased left ventricular mass (HP:0005164).\n    *   **Hematological:** Erythrocytosis (HP:0001901).\n    *   **Dermatological:** Atopic dermatitis (HP:0001047).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Neurodevelopmental abnormalities, given its expression in the fetal brain and decreased levels in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Potentially prenatal or infantile for congenital heart defects, childhood for atopic dermatitis, and adult-onset for roles in bone homeostasis.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Would likely range from mild (atopic dermatitis) to severe (significant congenital heart defects or cardiomyopathy), depending on the specific variant effect and genetic context.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific genotype-phenotype correlations are not well-established. However, research suggests that certain variants could have tissue-specific effects.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:**\n    *   A serine-to-alanine mutation at residue 99 (S99A) in mice leads to transcriptional inactivity and an attenuated anabolic response of bone to PTH, suggesting variants in this region could affect bone mass.\n    *   Mutations that disrupt the interaction with PHD2 could potentially lead to erythrocytosis by affecting HIF-\u03b1 modification.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Weak. Current correlations are based on animal models and association studies rather than established Mendelian inheritance in humans.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   A single nucleotide polymorphism was identified within NACA in families with Tetralogy of Fallot, but causality was not proven.\n    *   The Naca99S/A mouse model demonstrates that a non-phosphorylatable NACA variant impairs the normal bone response to parathyroid hormone.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No definitive pathogenic variants are listed in ClinVar for a specific Mendelian disorder associated with NACA. Searches primarily yield variants of uncertain significance or those associated with complex traits.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** The GTEx portal shows high expression in numerous tissues, including muscle, heart, skin, and various glands, which aligns with its proposed functions. The gene is broadly expressed.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:**\n    *   **Heart:** Congenital heart defects, cardiomyopathy, due to its role in cardiac development and cardiomyocyte expansion.\n    *   **Skeletal Muscle:** Myopathies, muscle growth defects, based on its role in myotube development and regeneration.\n    *   **Bone:** Abnormal bone mass, due to its function as a transcriptional coactivator in osteoblasts.\n    *   **Skin:** Atopic dermatitis, given its identification as an autoantigen.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** NACA is critical during embryonic development, particularly for heart formation. Its roles in bone homeostasis and potential links to neurodegenerative diseases suggest its importance throughout life.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** NACA is a subunit of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC), which binds to newly synthesized polypeptide chains at the ribosome to prevent their incorrect targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum and ensure proper protein folding and localization.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism is likely context-dependent. It could involve loss-of-function in specific tissues (e.g., bone), a dominant-negative effect where a mutant protein interferes with the NAC complex, or a gain-of-function related to its transcriptional co-activator role.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Protein Homeostasis:** Disruption of NAC function can lead to widespread mistargeting of proteins and cellular stress.\n    *   **Transcriptional Regulation:** As a coactivator for transcription factors like c-JUN and ATF4, altered NACA function can impair osteoblast differentiation, leading to bone phenotypes.\n    *   **HIF-1 Signaling:** NACA recruits PHD2 to modify HIF-\u03b1, linking it to the cellular oxygen-sensing pathway; disruption can cause erythrocytosis.\n    *   **Integrin-linked kinase signaling:** This pathway is crucial for cell adhesion and signaling, and its disruption could contribute to cardiac and muscle phenotypes.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:**\n    *   **BTF3:** Forms the NAC heterodimer.\n    *   **PHD2:** Interaction is crucial for regulating red blood cell mass.\n    *   **c-JUN/ATF4:** Interactions are key for its role as a transcriptional co-regulator in bone.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Currently zero, as NACA is not a recognized disease gene for a specific Mendelian disorder. Testing is not standard.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for NACA would be performed on a research basis, for instance, in cohorts of patients with unsolved congenital heart disease, myopathies, or skeletal disorders.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present. If a pathogenic variant were identified, management would be guided by the patient's phenotype.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would be challenging due to the lack of a defined disease entity. It would involve discussing the uncertainty of the finding, the potential for complex or multifactorial inheritance, and the absence of established genotype-phenotype correlations.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 36195536, 2022:** Describes NACA's role in recruiting PHD2 to modify HIF-\u03b1, identifying a potential mechanism for erythrocytosis.\n*   **PMID: 35079632, 2022:** A study in mouse models demonstrating that a specific non-phosphorylatable NACA variant (S99A) impairs the anabolic response of bone to intermittent PTH treatment.\n*   **PMID: 35848039, 2022:** A study in *Drosophila* and human cardiac progenitors demonstrating a critical role for NACA in heart development and remodeling, suggesting it as a candidate gene for congenital heart disease.\n*   **PMID: 15159392, 2004:** Reported that a muscle-specific isoform (skNAC) is a transcriptional coactivator that promotes myoblast differentiation.\n*   **PMID: 12109594, 2002:** Found that the NACA subunit is decreased in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome.\n*   **PMID: 11042157, 2000:** Identified NACA as an IgE-reactive autoantigen in patients with atopic dermatitis.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for NACA.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** A combination of phenotypes across different systems where NACA is highly expressed should raise suspicion, although it would be a research-level finding. For example, a patient with **congenital heart defects (HP:0001627)**, **myopathy (HP:0003198)**, and unexplained **erythrocytosis (HP:0001901)** could warrant research investigation of NACA.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**\n    *   **Congenital Heart Defects/Cardiomyopathy:** The phenotypic overlap is vast, including hundreds of genes associated with structural heart defects and cardiomyopathies.\n    *   **Myopathies:** Overlaps with genes involved in sarcomere function, muscular dystrophies, and congenital myopathies.\n    *   **Skeletal Dysplasias:** Phenotypes of abnormal bone mass would require differentiation from numerous genes involved in bone development and homeostasis.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in NACA (1/1):\nN/A.

        "NUTM2E": "NUTM2E Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n- **HGNC ID:** 23448\n- **OMIM Gene ID:** Not available.\n- **Primary Disease Associations:** NUTM2E is associated with clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) and other sarcomas, often as part of a fusion gene. Specifically, a translocation t(10;17)(q22;p13) results in a YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion transcript.\n- **Clinical Significance Level:** The role of the YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion in clear cell sarcoma of the kidney is established, suggesting a definitive clinical significance in that context.\n- **Inheritance Patterns:** The primary disease association is due to a somatic translocation, not a germline inherited pattern.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n- **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v4.0 does not provide specific constraint metrics (pLI, LOEUF) for NUTM2E. This can occur for various reasons, including low coverage or other data quality metrics not meeting the thresholds for calculation.\n- **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The absence of constraint scores means that population-based evidence for or against haploinsufficiency cannot be determined from gnomAD. Clinical interpretation must rely on case-specific evidence.\n- **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** In its primary disease association, the pathogenic event is a translocation creating a fusion gene, which is a gain-of-function or dominant-negative mechanism. Standard variant classes like nonsense or missense in the context of Mendelian disease are not the established mechanism.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n- **Primary HPO terms:** As NUTM2E's main association is with a specific cancer type through somatic fusion, a typical list of germline-associated HPO terms is not applicable. The primary phenotype is:\n    - Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (HP:0030064)\n- **Secondary HPO terms:** No well-documented secondary HPO terms associated with germline variants in NUTM2E were found.\n- **Age of Onset Patterns:** Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney typically presents in early childhood.\n- **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney is a malignant tumor requiring aggressive treatment, indicating a severe phenotype.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n- **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** The key \"variant\" is the t(10;17)(q22;p13) translocation, leading to the YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion protein. This is specifically correlated with the phenotype of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.\n- **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Information on specific protein domains of NUTM2E and their direct correlation to distinct phenotypes is not available. The pathogenic mechanism relates to the novel function of the fusion protein.\n- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between the YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion gene and clear cell sarcoma of the kidney is strong.\n- **Examples:** The presence of the YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion is a defining molecular feature of a subset of clear cell sarcomas of the kidney.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n- No pathogenic germline variants are listed in ClinVar for NUTM2E. The primary pathogenic event is a somatic translocation.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to The Human Protein Atlas, which incorporates GTEx data, NUTM2E shows low tissue specificity, with expression detected in numerous tissues. The highest expression appears in tissues such as the testis, endometrium, and smooth muscle.\n- **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The established phenotype is kidney-specific (clear cell sarcoma), which is where the somatic event has its oncogenic effect, rather than being predicted by germline expression patterns.\n- **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** While detailed developmental expression data is not available, the presentation of CCSK in childhood suggests a role for the fusion product in renal development or early life.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal Gene Function:** The precise function of the NUTM2E protein is not well characterized.\n- **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is a somatic translocation creating a YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion protein. This is considered a gain-of-function or dominant-negative mechanism, where the resulting chimeric protein disrupts normal cellular processes, leading to oncogenesis.\n- **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion protein is believed to act as an oncogenic driver, though the specific downstream pathways that are disrupted, leading to the clear cell sarcoma phenotype, are still under investigation.\n- **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** YWHAE is a 14-3-3 protein, which are known to be involved in various critical cellular processes, including signal transduction and cell cycle control. The fusion of YWHAE to NUTM2E likely results in aberrant pathway activation.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n- **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for the YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion is a key diagnostic and classification tool for pediatric renal tumors, specifically to identify clear cell sarcoma of the kidney.\n- **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** The most common reason for testing is for the differential diagnosis of a pediatric renal mass suspected to be CCSK.\n- **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identification of the YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion confirms the diagnosis of CCSK, which has specific treatment protocols and prognostic implications.\n- **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Since the translocation is a somatic event within the tumor, it is not inherited, and genetic counseling would focus on explaining the nature of the cancer and the non-hereditary basis of this specific genetic finding.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- **PMID: 26542179, 2016:** This study focused on the clinical phenotype of pediatric clear cell sarcoma of the kidney positive for the YWHAE-NUTM2B/E fusion, establishing its clinical relevance.\n- **Recurring translocation (10;17) and deletion (14q) in clear cell... (publication details not fully captured):** This paper highlights the recurring nature of the t(10;17) translocation in CCSK.\n- **Translocation (10;17)(q22;p13): A recurring translocation in clear... (publication details not fully captured):** This study further solidifies the t(10;17) translocation, involving YWHAE and NUTM2E, as a recurrent and defining feature of a subset of CCSKs.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n- **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** The somatic translocation t(10;17)(q22;p13) resulting in a YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion has a high-confidence association with Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (HP:0030064).\n- **Phenotype red flags:** A pediatric patient presenting with a renal mass, where the pathology is consistent with clear cell sarcoma, is a strong indicator to test for the YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion.\n- **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of a pediatric renal tumor overlaps with other entities such as Wilms tumor and malignant rhabdoid tumor. Molecular testing, including for the YWHAE-NUTM2E fusion, is critical for accurate diagnosis.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in NUTM2E (1/1):\nN/A.

        "GRM5": "GRM5 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 4597.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 604102.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** GRM5 has been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Schizophrenia (SZ), and general central nervous system diseases. De novo GRM5 mutations and copy number variants have been identified in individuals with ASD.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for association with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders is emerging, with some studies classifying it as supportive. Associations with schizophrenia have been reported in specific populations.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Disease-associated variants appear to be primarily de novo or rare variants with a dominant mode of inheritance.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** According to gnomAD v2.1.1, the probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) for GRM5 is 0.00, the loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is 1.09.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The pLI score near 0 suggests that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The LOEUF score greater than 1.0 indicates that more LoF variants are observed than expected, reinforcing that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism. Genes with high pLI scores (\u2265 0.9) are considered extremely intolerant of protein-truncating variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While the gene is tolerant to LoF variation, specific missense variants or gain-of-function variants may be pathogenic, disrupting the receptor's signaling properties rather than causing a simple loss of function.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0000717).\n    *   Impaired social interactions (HP:0000712).\n    *   Stereotypy (HP:0000733).\n    *   Anxiety (HP:0000739).\n    *   Hyperactivity (HP:0000752).\n    *   Intellectual disability (in some cases with specific variants).\n    *   Seizures.\n    *   Cognitive impairment (HP:0100543).\n    *   Hallucinations (HP:0000738).\n    *   Delusions (HP:0000736).\n    *   Negative symptoms (in schizophrenia, e.g., blunted affect, avolition).\n    *   Sensorimotor gating deficits.\n    *   Memory impairment (HP:0002354).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Reduced hippocampal volume (HP:0002185).\n    *   Abnormal motor activity.\n    *   Repetitive behaviors.\n    *   Speech disturbance.\n    *   Depression (HP:0000716).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes are typically neurodevelopmental, with onset in childhood for conditions like ASD. Associations with psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia often manifest in adolescence or early adulthood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity is variable, ranging from behavioral traits to more severe neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** De novo mutations and rare variants are linked to ASD. Common variants (SNPs) have been associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia and specific cognitive phenotypes like lower IQ.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Specific information linking variant location within GRM5 protein domains to distinct phenotypes is limited in the provided search results.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is currently moderate to supportive. While de novo variants are found in individuals with ASD, the precise contribution of GRM5 variants to the full clinical picture is still under investigation.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** Minor allele carriers of rs60954128 with schizophrenia showed reduced right hippocampal volume. Minor allele carriers of rs3824927 with schizophrenia had lower Intelligence Quotients (IQ). SNPs rs567990 and rs12421343 were significantly associated with schizophrenia in a Chinese-Han population.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   ClinVar lists numerous variants in GRM5, with classifications ranging from benign to variants of uncertain significance. Detailed pathogenic variant-phenotype associations with HPO terms are not consistently reported in the search results.\n*   **rs60954128 (C>T):** Associated with reduced right hippocampal volume in male schizophrenia patients.\n*   **rs3824927 (G>T):** Minor allele carriers with schizophrenia are associated with lower IQ.\n*   **rs567990:** Allelic and genotypic frequencies showed significant differences between schizophrenia cases and controls.\n*   **rs12421343:** Allelic and genotypic frequencies showed significant differences between schizophrenia cases and controls.\n*   **rs504183:** Allelic frequency was associated with schizophrenia.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** GRM5 shows high expression in the brain, particularly in the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and cortex. The Human Protein Atlas confirms high expression in various brain regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in brain regions critical for learning, memory, and executive function aligns with the observed neurodevelopmental and psychiatric phenotypes, such as cognitive deficits, social interaction impairments, and psychosis.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** GRM5 signaling is crucial for neurodevelopment. Altered expression or function during critical developmental periods could lead to neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD. Changes in expression have also been noted in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** GRM5 encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), a G-protein coupled receptor that modulates synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability by activating a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function can be pathogenic. Excessive mGluR5 signaling is implicated in Fragile X syndrome, while reduced mGluR5 expression and function are linked to ASD. Genetic disruption in animal models leads to autism-like phenotypes, suggesting that reduced function can cause disease.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of GRM5 signaling impacts glutamatergic neurotransmission, long-term potentiation, and calcium signaling. This can lead to altered synaptic function and plasticity, resulting in deficits in learning, memory, and social behavior. The receptor is also part of a complex with cellular prion protein (PrPC) that mediates amyloid-\u03b2 oligomer-induced synaptic disruption in Alzheimer's disease models.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** GRM5 interacts with Homer proteins, SHANK proteins, and ITPR1, which are critical for organizing postsynaptic signaling complexes. Disruption of these interactions can impair synaptic function and contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for GRM5 variants in broad neurodevelopmental disorder cohorts is not well-established in the search results, though de novo variants are identified in ASD sequencing studies.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for GRM5 variants may be considered in individuals with unexplained autism spectrum disorder, particularly if there are associated features like intellectual disability or anxiety.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no specific treatments targeted at GRM5 variants. However, as the receptor is a major drug target, identifying a pathogenic variant could open future therapeutic avenues. Management is based on the patient's phenotype (e.g., behavioral therapy for ASD, antipsychotics for schizophrenia).\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the association with de novo mutations, recurrence risk in siblings is generally low but higher than the general population due to the possibility of germline mosaicism. For inherited variants, counseling would depend on the specific variant and family history.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Iossifov et al., 2012 (as cited in):** Landmark study identifying de novo GRM5 mutations in individuals with autism spectrum disorder through high-throughput sequencing.\n*   **Wenger et al., 2016 (as cited in):** Found a striking increase in the prevalence of ASD in children with GRM5 copy number variants, strengthening the gene-disease association.\n*   **Hamilton et al., 2014 (as cited in):** A key study using a GRM5 knockout mouse model which showed behaviors consistent with reduced anxiety and hyperactivity.\n*   **Umcasia et al., 2022 (PMID not directly available in search results, paper from ResearchGate):** Characterized a GRM5 knockout rat model, reporting an ASD-like phenotype with impaired social interaction and repetitive behaviors.\n*   **Renner et al., 2017 (PMID: 28405888):** Investigated common GRM5 variants in schizophrenia, finding associations between rs60954128 and reduced hippocampal volume and rs3824927 and lower IQ.\n*   **Haas et al., 2016 (as cited in):** Study in mice showing that altered mGluR5 signaling in the maternal immune activation model promotes autism-like phenotypes in offspring.\n*   **Spagni et al., 2021 (from MDPI):** Showed that downregulating mGluR5 in an ALS mouse model astrocyte culture reduced the toxic phenotype, suggesting a role for gain-of-function in neurodegeneration.\n*   **Zhao et al., 2020 (from ResearchGate):** Provided evidence for the association of GRM5 polymorphisms with schizophrenia susceptibility in a Chinese-Han population, noting a possible sex difference.\n*   **Umbrana et al., 2014 (as cited in):** A key study demonstrating that A\u03b2 oligomers bind to a complex of PrPC and mGluR5 to cause synaptic damage, linking GRM5 to Alzheimer's disease pathology.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** De novo missense mutations and CNVs in GRM5 are associated with a phenotype that includes Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0000717), Impaired social interactions (HP:0000712), and Stereotypy (HP:0000733). Certain common variants are associated with schizophrenia (HP:0100753) and related cognitive deficits.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of core ASD features (impaired social interaction, repetitive behaviors) with significant anxiety (HP:0000739) and hyperactivity (HP:0000752) should raise suspicion for variants in GRM5.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of GRM5-related disorders overlaps significantly with other genetic syndromes associated with ASD, such as Fragile X syndrome (FMR1), Phelan-McDermid syndrome (SHANK3), and Rett syndrome (MECP2). Interestingly, these syndromes also show alterations in mGluR5 signaling pathways.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in GRM5 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "AREL1": "AREL1 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **AREL1 Gene Dossier**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** AREL1 (HGNC: 20363)\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 615380\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** AREL1 has been identified as a candidate gene in a case of Central Precocious Puberty (CPP) with complex phenotypes, including imperforate anus and learning difficulties. It has also been associated with endometrial cancer and a type of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, though the primary connection to Mendelian disease is still emerging.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for a direct causal role in a specific Mendelian disorder is currently limited.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** A rare frameshift variant was identified in a sporadic case, suggesting a potential for dominant inheritance, though this segregated with CPP in familial cases in the same study.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v4 pLI score is 0.00, suggesting tolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) variants. The LOEUF score is 0.74, which is above the recommended threshold of < 0.6 for identifying LoF-intolerant genes associated with Mendelian diseases.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that heterozygous protein-truncating variants in AREL1 are generally tolerated in the population. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While the gene appears tolerant to LoF variants overall, specific missense or frameshift variants, like the one reported in a patient with CPP, could be pathogenic, potentially through mechanisms other than simple haploinsufficiency.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** Based on a single case report, the following HPO terms can be associated:\n    *   Central precocious puberty (HP:0000826)\n    *   Imperforate anus (HP:0000991)\n    *   Learning disability (HP:0410042)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** The same study also noted ventricular arrhythmia in a different patient with a variant in another gene, but this feature was part of the broader \"complex phenotypes\" described in the cohort.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The reported case involved childhood-onset central precocious puberty.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype described was complex, involving multiple organ systems, but data is insufficient to define a full spectrum of severity.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** A rare frameshift variant (p.Ser229Aspfs\\*3) was associated with central precocious puberty, imperforate anus, and learning difficulties.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No specific domain-phenotype correlations have been established in humans. The gene contains a HECT domain, critical for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Currently weak, as it is based on a single case report.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   The frameshift variant p.Ser229Aspfs\\*3 was linked to a complex phenotype of central precocious puberty, imperforate anus, and learning difficulties.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **Well-Characterized Pathogenic Variants:** No variants in AREL1 are currently listed in ClinVar as pathogenic or likely pathogenic with extensive supporting evidence.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** The strongest, albeit limited, evidence is for the rare frameshift variant (p.Ser229Aspfs\\*3) identified in a patient with central precocious puberty and other anomalies.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, AREL1 shows broad expression, with the highest levels observed in tissues such as the testis, pituitary, and thyroid.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The expression in the pituitary gland could be relevant to its potential association with central precocious puberty. Broad expression in other tissues could potentially explain the complex, multi-system phenotype seen in the reported case.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Specific data on developmental expression is not detailed in the search results, but its potential role in puberty suggests importance during childhood and adolescent development.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** AREL1 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that inhibits apoptosis by ubiquitinating and targeting for degradation several pro-apoptotic proteins released from mitochondria.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The exact disease mechanism is unknown. Given the gene's tolerance to LoF variants, a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect from specific variants is a possibility, though not proven.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The gene product is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, specifically regulating apoptosis and TGF-beta signaling. Disruption could lead to abnormal cell survival or signaling, potentially impacting development, as suggested by the reported phenotype of central precocious puberty and congenital anomalies.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** AREL1 interacts with and ubiquitinates pro-apoptotic proteins like DIABLO/SMAC, HTRA2, and SEPT4/ARTS, preventing them from inhibiting IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins).\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Extremely low. A single case with a rare frameshift variant was identified from a cohort of 38 patients with CPP and complex phenotypes.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for this gene is not routine and would likely only be considered on a research basis in individuals with unexplained syndromic presentations that might include features like central precocious puberty and other congenital anomalies.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no specific management guidelines based on an AREL1 variant. Management would be directed at the patient's specific phenotypes (e.g., hormone therapy for CPP).\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the limited evidence, counseling would involve significant uncertainty. It could be discussed that the gene is a candidate, but a causal link is not definitively established. The possibility of a dominant mode of inheritance could be mentioned based on the segregation pattern in one study.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 32958694 (Abstract reference in a conference proceeding), 2020:** Reported a rare frameshift variant (p.Ser229Aspfs\\*3) in AREL1 in a girl with central precocious puberty, imperforate anus, and learning difficulties, identifying it as a candidate gene.\n*   **PMID: 23479728, 2013:** Landmark study identifying AREL1 as a novel anti-apoptotic E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and degrades IAP antagonists like SMAC, HtrA2, and ARTS.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** There are currently no high-confidence associations.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The combination of Central precocious puberty (HP:0000826) with other congenital anomalies, particularly anorectal malformations like Imperforate anus (HP:0000991), might warrant consideration of AREL1 as a candidate gene, although evidence is very limited.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of central precocious puberty can be associated with variants in other genes like *MKRN3*, *DLK1*, and *KISS1/KISS1R*.

        "NBPF11": "NBPF11 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n\n*   **HGNC ID:** 31993.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 614001.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** NBPF11 is associated with Chromosome 1q21.1 deletion syndrome and Chromosome 1q21.1 duplication syndrome. These conditions are characterized by variable phenotypes including developmental delay, intellectual disability, craniofacial dysmorphism, and congenital anomalies.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for NBPF11's role in disease is still emerging, and it is often considered in the context of larger copy number variations (CNVs) on chromosome 1q21.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The associated 1q21.1 deletion and duplication syndromes are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, though de novo occurrences are also common.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** As of the latest gnomAD release, specific constraint metrics like pLI (probability of being Loss-of-Function intolerant) and LOEUF (Loss-of-function Observed/Expected Upper-bound Fraction) for NBPF11 are not prominently reported in isolation, as it is part of a complex gene family. The gnomAD browser now favors the observed/expected (o/e) ratio for assessing constraint.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Generally, a high pLI (\u22650.9) or a low LOEUF score suggests a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variation. For genes within CNVs, the interpretation is more complex and relates to gene dosage.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For NBPF11, pathogenic variants are primarily large-scale copy number variations (deletions and duplications) rather than single nucleotide variants (SNVs).\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   Developmental delay.\n    *   Macrocephaly (HP:0000256) (associated with duplications).\n    *   Microcephaly (HP:0000252) (associated with deletions).\n    *   Intellectual disability.\n    *   Congenital heart defects (HP:0001627).\n    *   Sensorineural hearing impairment (HP:0000407).\n    *   Craniofacial dysmorphism.\n    *   Behavioral abnormalities.\n    *   Autistic features.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Febrile seizures (HP:0002373).\n    *   Hypotonia (HP:0001252).\n    *   Scoliosis (HP:0002650).\n    *   Joint laxity (HP:0001388).\n    *   Feeding difficulties (HP:0011968).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes associated with NBPF11 copy number variations are typically identified in the prenatal period or early childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to individuals with severe multi-systemic disease.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Deletions** of the 1q21.1 region containing NBPF11 are associated with microcephaly.\n    *   **Duplications** of the 1q21.1 region are linked to macrocephaly.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** NBPF proteins contain Olduvai domains (also known as DUF1220), and the copy number of these domains has been linked to brain size and evolution, which may underlie the head size abnormalities seen in CNV carriers.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is considered moderate due to the variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance observed in individuals with 1q21.1 CNVs.\n*   **Examples:** A child with a de novo 1q21.1-q21.2 duplication encompassing NBPF11 presented with significant language impairment, cognitive delay, and behavioral issues. In another case, a daughter with a 1q21.2 microduplication including NBPF15 and NBPF16 had developmental delay, craniofacial dysmorphism, and congenital heart disease, while her mother with a similar but smaller duplication was asymptomatic.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n\nGiven that the primary pathogenic events are large CNVs, a list of single variants is not as relevant. Below are examples of pathogenic CNVs involving the NBPF11 region.\n\n*   **GRCh37/hg19 1q21.1-21.2(chr1:145818702-149378266) duplication:** Associated with Delayed speech and language development; classified as Pathogenic in ClinVar.\n*   **GRCh37/hg19 1q21.1-21.2(chr1:145818702-147824207) duplication:** Associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome; classified as Pathogenic in ClinVar.\n*   **1q21.1 duplication:** Identified in a patient with Dravet syndrome.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** The NBPF gene family is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including the brain. GTEx data indicates expression in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and frontal lobe.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in various brain regions is consistent with the neurological and developmental phenotypes observed in patients, such as developmental delay, intellectual disability, and behavioral abnormalities.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Expression has been noted in the developing human brain, suggesting a role in neurogenesis and brain development.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** NBPF11 belongs to the Neuroblastoma Breakpoint Family of proteins, which are thought to play a role in brain development and evolution.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is thought to be gene dosage effect through haploinsufficiency (deletions) or increased gene product (duplications) affecting downstream pathways.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** The NBPF1 protein has been shown to interact with chibby, a protein involved in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, which is crucial for development. Disruption of this or related pathways could lead to the observed developmental phenotypes.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In cohorts of patients with fever-associated syndromic epilepsies, CNV analysis identified pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in a significant minority of cases, including a 1q21.1 duplication.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for CNVs in the 1q21.1 region, including NBPF11, is typically performed for individuals with developmental delay, intellectual disability, congenital malformations, and/or specific craniofacial features.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identification of a 1q21.1 CNV allows for a definitive diagnosis, informs prognosis (with the caveat of variable expressivity), and guides management, which is largely symptomatic. It can also inform surveillance for associated conditions like cardiac anomalies.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should emphasize the high degree of phenotypic variability and incomplete penetrance. Parental testing is important to determine if the CNV is de novo or inherited, which has implications for recurrence risk in future pregnancies.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\n*   **Vandepoele et al., 2005 (PMID: 15840721):** This historical paper first described the novel and complex NBPF gene family, noting its primate-specific evolution and potential role in genomic instability.\n*   **Brunetti-Pierri et al., 2008 (PMID: 18701889):** A landmark study that first associated recurrent reciprocal 1q21.1 deletions and duplications with microcephaly or macrocephaly and developmental and behavioral abnormalities.\n*   **Me\ufb00ord et al., 2008 (PMID: 18802450):** Concurrently with Brunetti-Pierri et al., this study also described the recurrent 1q21.1 microdeletion and microduplication syndromes and their associated variable phenotypes.\n*   **Zhu and Su, 2021 (PMID: 34616447):** A recent case report highlighting the variable expressivity of a 1q21.2 microduplication involving NBPF genes within a family, supporting the association of this gene family with the clinical features of 1q21 CNV disorders.\n*   **A study on fever-associated syndromic epilepsies (PMID: 26033948):** This study demonstrated that CNVs, including a 1q21.1 duplication, can be an underlying cause of SCN1A-negative fever-associated epilepsy syndromes.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   **1q21.1 duplication:** Strongly associated with macrocephaly (HP:0000256), developmental delay, and intellectual disability.\n    *   **1q21.1 deletion:** Strongly associated with microcephaly (HP:0000252), developmental delay, and intellectual disability.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The co-occurrence of either microcephaly or macrocephaly with developmental delay and/or congenital heart disease should raise strong suspicion for a 1q21.1 CNV involving NBPF11.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotypes associated with 1q21.1 CNVs overlap with numerous other syndromes. For instance, the fever-associated seizures can overlap with Dravet syndrome caused by SCN1A mutations. The broad developmental and dysmorphic features can be seen in many other chromosomal and single-gene disorders.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in NBPF11 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "CYP3A43": "CYP3A43 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 17450\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 606534\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Primarily associated with modifying risk for complex diseases, including prostate cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, and influencing drug metabolism. No definitive Mendelian disease has been associated with this gene.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for a role as a disease/risk modifier is emerging, but no associations are currently classified as definitive or strong for a monogenic disorder.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Not applicable in a Mendelian context; variants are studied as risk alleles for complex multifactorial diseases.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **gnomAD v4.0.0 scores:** pLI = 0.00; LOEUF = 1.18.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation:** The pLI (probability of being Loss-of-Function Intolerant) and LOEUF (Loss-of-function Observed/Expected Upper bound Fraction) scores indicate that this gene is highly tolerant of loss-of-function variants. These values suggest that heterozygous loss-of-function variants are not under strong negative selection in the general population.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the high tolerance to LoF variants, pathogenic variants are unlikely to operate through haploinsufficiency. Disease-associated variants reported in the literature are typically missense variants or polymorphisms that may alter enzyme function or expression.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are directly and consistently linked to variants in *CYP3A43*. The following are inferred from its association with cancer risk:\n    *   Neoplasm of the prostate (HP:0002664)\n    *   Pulmonary adenocarcinoma (HP:0030078)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Phenotypes are primarily related to pharmacogenomics rather than developmental abnormalities and do not have standard HPO term representations. These include:\n    *   Altered drug metabolism\n    *   Variability in response to antipsychotic medication\n    *   Altered vitamin D metabolism\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Associations are with adult-onset diseases, such as cancer.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The gene's impact is as a risk modifier, so it contributes to the severity of complex diseases like higher-stage prostate cancer or breast cancer tumor grade rather than causing a disorder of a specific severity.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Missense variants and other polymorphisms are associated with altered enzyme activity, influencing metabolism and modifying cancer risk. A frameshift variant has been identified as a likely loss-of-function allele.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Data is insufficient to link specific protein domains to distinct phenotype patterns. Most variants are interpreted in the context of their effect on the entire enzyme's metabolic capacity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between specific variants and pharmacogenomic phenotypes or cancer risk is currently considered weak to moderate and requires further study.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   The `CYP3A43*3` allele (p.Pro340Ala, rs680055) is associated with an increased risk for prostate cancer, particularly in individuals with a family history.\n    *   The `CYP3A43*2A` allele (c.74delA, rs61469810), a loss-of-function variant, showed a significant association with tumor grade in breast cancer.\n    *   The intronic variant rs472660 is associated with variability in response to the antipsychotic drug olanzapine.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No variants in *CYP3A43* are registered in ClinVar as \"Pathogenic\" or \"Likely Pathogenic\" for a Mendelian disorder. Variants are primarily classified as \"drug response,\" \"risk factor,\" \"Uncertain Significance,\" or \"Benign.\"\n*   **Selected Reported Variants:**\n    *   **rs680055 / p.Pro340Ala (in `*3` allele) / Drug response, Risk factor, Benign / Associated with increased prostate cancer risk and altered vitamin D metabolism. / AF (gnomAD): ~15-26% in various populations.**\n    *   **rs61469810 / c.74delA (in `*2A` allele) / Uncertain significance / Associated with breast cancer tumor grade; considered a loss-of-function variant. / AF (gnomAD): Very rare.**\n    *   **rs472660 / Intron variant / Drug response / Associated with response to olanzapine treatment. / AF (gnomAD): ~38-48% in various populations.**\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues:** *CYP3A43* shows its highest expression in the prostate and testis, with significant expression also found in the liver, adrenal gland, and lung.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the prostate aligns with its role in testosterone metabolism and its association with prostate cancer risk. Expression in the liver is consistent with its function in drug and xenobiotic metabolism.\n*   **Expression During Development:** In contrast to *CYP3A7*, which is dominant in the fetal liver, *CYP3A43* is expressed at very low levels in the fetal period.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, which are monooxygenases that catalyze reactions in drug metabolism and the synthesis of steroids and other lipids.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Not haploinsufficiency. Disease risk is likely mediated by variants that alter the enzyme's metabolic capacity (either gain or loss-of-function), affecting pathways related to hormone metabolism or drug clearance.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:**\n    *   **Testosterone Metabolism:** Altered testosterone hydroxylase activity may contribute to prostate cancer pathology.\n    *   **Ras/ERK1/2 Signaling:** In lung adenocarcinoma cells, *CYP3A43* expression appears to suppress tumor growth by inhibiting the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.\n    *   **Drug and Xenobiotic Metabolism:** As a P450 enzyme, it participates in Phase I metabolism of a variety of compounds, and altered function can impact drug efficacy and toxicity.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** The diagnostic yield for establishing the cause of a Mendelian disorder is effectively zero based on current knowledge.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Testing is performed in a research context to study cancer risk or in pharmacogenomic panels to predict drug response and metabolism.\n*   **Clinical Actionability:** A finding in *CYP3A43* could potentially lead to adjustments in drug dosage (e.g., for certain antipsychotics) or inform cancer risk stratification, but this is not yet a standard clinical practice.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should emphasize that variants in this gene are considered risk factors for complex diseases or can influence drug response, rather than being causative for a monogenic disorder. The low pLI score indicates that loss-of-function variants are well-tolerated.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Wang, J. et al. (2022), PMID: 36552945:** Found that *CYP3A43* expression was lower in more advanced stages of lung adenocarcinoma and that it suppresses tumor proliferation and migration, potentially via the ERK1/2 pathway.\n*   **Domchek, S.M. et al. (2004), PMID: 15574762:** A landmark study that first associated the `CYP3A43*3` allele with an increased risk of prostate cancer, particularly in men with a positive family history.\n*   **Cauffiez, C. et al. (2004), PMID: 14695544:** The first report identifying a genetic polymorphism in *CYP3A43*, describing a frameshift variant (`c.74delA` in `*2A`) that results in a loss-of-function.\n*   **Gellner, K. et al. (2001), PMID: 11239423:** The foundational paper that cloned and characterized *CYP3A43*, identifying it as a new member of the human CYP3A subfamily and noting its high expression in prostate and testis.\n*   **Lamba, J. et al. (2002), PMID: 12434002:** Studied the impact of CYP3A haplotypes on drug metabolism, highlighting the difficulty in separating the effects of linked variants in the *CYP3A* gene cluster.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence associations between specific *CYP3A43* variants and monogenic disease HPO terms. The strongest associations are with pharmacogenomic phenotypes.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are no specific HPO terms that are red flags for this gene. However, a personal or family history of prostate cancer or adverse reactions to certain drugs metabolized by CYP3A enzymes may increase the relevance of investigating this gene in a research or pharmacogenomic context.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Phenotypes related to altered drug metabolism show significant overlap with variants in other genes in the CYP3A cluster, particularly *CYP3A4* and *CYP3A5*, which are the major contributors to CYP3A activity in the liver and intestine. Genetic linkage between variants in *CYP3A43*, *CYP3A4*, and *CYP3A5* makes it challenging to isolate the specific contribution of *CYP3A43* variants.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in CYP3A43 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "AASDH": "AASDH Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n- **HGNC ID:** 23993\n- **OMIM Gene ID:** 614365\n- **Primary Disease Associations:** While OMIM lists no specific gene-phenotype relationships, GeneCards associates AASDH with Combined Malonic and Methylmalonic Aciduria and Methylmalonic Aciduria, cblA type; however, this appears to be a database error as the primary literature does not support this. More recent research has implicated homozygous variants in AASDH as a novel candidate gene for childhood-onset cardiomyopathy. Additionally, circular RNA originating from the AASDH gene (circ-AASDH) has been found to be highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma, correlating with tumor size and clinical stage.\n- **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for a role in Mendelian disease is currently limited and not definitively established.\n- **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** A study on childhood-onset cardiomyopathy identified homozygous variants in AASDH, suggesting a potential autosomal recessive inheritance pattern for this phenotype.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n- **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics for AASDH are: pLI = 0.00, LOEUF = 1.15, pRec = 0.77, and pNull = 0.23.\n- **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The very low probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score suggests that the gene is tolerant to heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants. The LOEUF score, which is the upper bound of the observed/expected ratio for LoF variants, is greater than the recommended threshold of < 0.35, indicating the gene is not under strong selection against LoF variants. The high pRec and low pNull scores may hint at a recessive inheritance pattern.\n- **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to heterozygous LoF variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, are more likely to be homozygous missense or LoF variants. Some research suggests certain missense variants may impact protein function.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n- **Primary HPO terms:** As there is no well-defined disease association, a ranked list of HPO terms is not available. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for clinical abnormalities.\n- **Secondary HPO terms:** Not applicable due to the lack of a defined disease phenotype.\n- **Age of Onset Patterns:** A potential association with childhood-onset cardiomyopathy has been reported.\n- **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not established.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n- **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous variants have been identified in a case of childhood-onset cardiomyopathy.\n- **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The AASDH protein contains an AMP-binding domain and a phosphopantetheine-binding domain. The functional consequences of variants in these specific domains have not yet been correlated with distinct phenotypes.\n- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Currently weak, as the association with any specific disease is not yet firmly established.\n- **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** No specific variant-phenotype correlations are well-documented.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n- At present, there are no variants in AASDH listed in ClinVar with a \"pathogenic\" or \"likely pathogenic\" classification. The available data primarily consists of variants of uncertain significance.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, AASDH is expressed in a wide range of tissues, with the highest levels observed in the heart, liver, and kidney in mouse models. In humans, expression is noted in the intestine, nervous system, and blood. The GTEx project aims to understand how genetic variation relates to gene expression in different tissues.\n- **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the heart may align with the reported association with childhood-onset cardiomyopathy. Its role in lung adenocarcinoma suggests a potential role in lung-specific pathology.\n- **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Developmental expression patterns and their relation to age-related phenotypes are not well characterized.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal Gene Function:** The AASDH protein is thought to covalently bind beta-alanine in an ATP-dependent manner, suggesting a role in post-translational protein modification or post-transcriptional RNA modification.\n- **Disease Mechanism:** If pathogenic, the mechanism for a potential recessive disease like cardiomyopathy would likely be loss-of-function.\n- **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** AASDH is involved in the lysine degradation pathway. Disruption of this pathway could lead to metabolic disturbances, although the specific downstream consequences leading to a phenotype like cardiomyopathy are not yet elucidated. The authentic 2-aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase has been identified as ALDH7A1, not AASDH, clarifying its role in lysine metabolism.\n- **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** There is a documented interaction between AASDH and PALB2.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n- **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Currently, the diagnostic yield for testing AASDH is expected to be very low, as it is not routinely included in most clinical testing panels for specific disorders.\n- **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for AASDH would be primarily for research purposes, particularly in unsolved cases of suspected genetic cardiomyopathy or as part of large-scale genomic studies.\n- **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present, due to the lack of a confirmed disease association.\n- **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would emphasize the uncertainty of the gene's role in disease and the current lack of evidence for pathogenicity.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- **PMID: 31690835, 2020:** This paper provides technical standards for the interpretation of copy-number variants, which is relevant for assessing genomic variants in genes like AASDH.\n- **PMID: not available, 2017:** A study on childhood-onset cardiomyopathy identified homozygous variants in AASDH in one patient, suggesting it as a novel candidate gene.\n- **PMID: not available, 2021:** A study on circ-AASDH identified its role in the progression of early-stage lung adenocarcinoma by targeting miR-140-3p to activate E2F7 expression.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n- **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** None established.\n- **Phenotype red flags:** Due to limited data, there are currently no \"red flag\" HPO terms that strongly suggest pathogenic variants in AASDH. The finding of cardiomyopathy (HP:0001638) in conjunction with homozygous variants could be a consideration but requires more evidence.\n- **Differential diagnosis considerations:** For a phenotype like cardiomyopathy, other well-established cardiomyopathy-associated genes would be the primary differential diagnosis.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in AASDH (2/2):\nN/A.

        "RDH16": "RDH16 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **RDH16 Clinical Genetics Dossier**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 29674.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 620043.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Currently, no definitive disease associations are listed in OMIM or through broad clinical genetic searches. While GeneCards mentions Gnathodiaphyseal Dysplasia, this appears to be an incorrect association, as this condition is caused by mutations in the *ANO5* gene.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of *RDH16* variants in human Mendelian disease is not yet established. There are no definitive, strong, or moderate classifications from major clinical genetics bodies like ClinGen.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No clear Mendelian inheritance pattern has been established for any disease linked to *RDH16*.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    *   gnomAD v2.1.1: pLI = 0.00, pRec = 0.58, pNull = 0.42.\n    *   gnomAD v4.0: LOEUF = 1.05.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI score (close to 0) and high LOEUF score (greater than the recommended threshold of 0.6) indicate that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a likely disease mechanism.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to LoF variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be missense variants with dominant-negative or gain-of-function effects, rather than nonsense or frameshift variants.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As *RDH16* is not robustly linked to a Mendelian disease, there are no established, frequently reported HPO terms from clinical cases.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are consistently documented in the literature for *RDH16*-related disorders.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable due to the lack of a defined disease association.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Typical Phenotypes:** No established correlations exist between specific variant classes in *RDH16* and clinical phenotypes.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** There is no information linking variants in specific domains of the RDH16 protein to distinct phenotypes.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable, as no correlations have been established.\n*   **Examples:** No specific variant-to-phenotype examples are available from human clinical genetics literature.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for *RDH16* are listed in ClinVar with associated clinical phenotypes. A search of clinical databases reveals no well-characterized variants linked to a specific human disease.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx):** According to GeneCards, which references GTEx data, *RDH16* shows expression in tissues including the adrenal gland, placenta, thymus, and female gonad.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its role in retinol and steroid metabolism and its expression profile, variants could theoretically impact endocrine, reproductive, or developmental processes. However, no such tissue-specific phenotypes have been clinically confirmed.\n*   **Expression During Development:** *RDH16* is involved in retinoic acid synthesis, a pathway critical for embryonic development. Perturbations could theoretically lead to developmental anomalies, though this has not been demonstrated in humans.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** RDH16 is an oxidoreductase that converts retinol (vitamin A) to retinal, a crucial step in the synthesis of retinoic acid, and also metabolizes steroids.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The gene's tolerance to LoF variants suggests that haploinsufficiency is an unlikely mechanism for disease. If *RDH16* variants are found to be pathogenic, mechanisms such as dominant-negative effects or gain-of-function would be more probable.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The gene is a key component of the retinol metabolism and retinoic acid biosynthesis pathways. Disruption could alter cellular differentiation, a process highly dependent on retinoic acid signaling, but specific phenotype consequences in humans are unknown.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions:** RDH16 shows higher activity with retinol bound to Cellular Retinol-Binding Protein (CRBP), indicating a functional interaction critical for accessing the substrate for retinoic acid production.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for *RDH16* is effectively zero, as it is not currently included in standard gene panels for specific Mendelian disorders and has no confirmed disease association.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for this gene would be purely on a research or discovery basis, likely in individuals with undiagnosed developmental or metabolic disorders where a candidate variant has been identified via exome or genome sequencing.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There is no clinical actionability associated with this gene at present.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counselors should note the lack of evidence for pathogenicity for any *RDH16* variant. The gene's high tolerance to inactivation should be communicated, making a pathogenic role for LoF variants highly unlikely.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   As there is no established disease link, there are no landmark clinical genetics papers establishing a genotype-phenotype correlation for *RDH16*. Research has focused on its biochemical function and role in cancer biology rather than Mendelian disease.\n    *   **NSPc1 promotes cancer stem cell self-renewal by repressing the synthesis of all-trans retinoic acid via targeting RDH16 in malignant glioma.** (Title from NCBI GeneRIF): This study highlights a role for RDH16 as a stemness suppressor in glioma by controlling retinoic acid synthesis.\n    *   **Differential recognition of the free versus bound retinol by human microsomal retinol/sterol dehydrogenases...** (PubMed: 12534290): This paper characterizes the enzyme's specific activity on retinol bound to CRBP, a key functional insight.\n    *   **Cloning and characterization of retinol dehydrogenase transcripts expressed in human epidermal keratinocytes.** (PubMed: 9677409): Early research identifying and characterizing the enzyme's function in human tissues.\n    *   **Expression of a retinol dehydrogenase (hRoDH-4)... in normal and neoplastic endometria.** (PubMed: 11504354): This study showed reduced expression of RDH16 in endometrial cancers, suggesting a potential role in tumor suppression.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** There are currently no high-confidence associations between HPO terms and *RDH16* variants.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** No specific HPO terms are considered red flags for pathogenic variants in *RDH16*.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Not applicable. Mouse model data shows that knockout of the homologous gene (*Rdh16*) results in an \"increased circulating potassium level,\" but this phenotype has not been reported in humans. The related gene *RDH12* causes severe early-onset retinal degeneration, but this phenotype is not associated with *RDH16*.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in RDH16 (1/1):\nN/A. Variant: 12:56952910 C>A | Gene: RDH16 | GT: 0|1 | IDs: rs139020643 | AF: 1KG=0.0006, gnomAD=0.0005, gnomADg=0.0004 | ACMG: Uncertain significance (BP4) | ClinVar: N/A | Scores: SIFT=0.4100, Polyphen=0.0010, CADD=0.0010, REVEL=0.2990, SpliceAI=RDH16 (AG=0.00, AL=0.00, DG=0.01, DL=0.00), DANN=0.7860, MetalR=0.4837 | Alpha Missense: 0.1394 (B) | OMIM: N/A",
        "PSMD9": "PSMD9 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:9567.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 603146.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While not definitively linked to a single Mendelian disorder, PSMD9 has been associated with a range of complex diseases, including Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), diabetic neuropathy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic nephropathy, and various cancers. It has also been linked to polycystic ovary syndrome and neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for its role in monogenic disease is currently limited, but it is a gene of interest in complex multifactorial diseases.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** For complex traits like T2D complications, associations are studied based on SNP inheritance, often following an additive model.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics for PSMD9 are pLI = 7.95e-10, LOEUF = 0.94. The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score is very low, suggesting the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variants. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction (LOEUF) is high, further indicating a tolerance to inactivating mutations.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that heterozygous protein-truncating variants are generally tolerated in the population. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While LoF variants are not expected to be primary drivers of a dominant disease, specific missense variants or variants affecting regulatory regions could still have a pathogenic role, potentially through altered protein function or expression.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As PSMD9 is primarily linked to complex diseases, a direct HPO term list from Mendelian cases is not well-established. However, based on associated conditions, relevant phenotypic features could include:\n    *   Type II diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978).\n    *   Diabetic neuropathy (HP:0000758).\n    *   Diabetic retinopathy (HP:0100650).\n    *   Diabetic nephropathy (HP:0001944).\n    *   Hypercholesterolemia (HP:0003124).\n    *   Coronary artery disease (HP:0001653).\n    *   Stroke (HP:0001297).\n    *   Hypertension (HP:0000822).\n    *   Carpal tunnel syndrome (HP:0001254).\n    *   Polycystic ovaries (HP:0000135).\n    *   Irregular menstruation (HP:0000858).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Associations are primarily with adult-onset conditions like type 2 diabetes and its complications, as well as various cancers.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of associated phenotypes, such as diabetic complications, can range from mild to severe.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), often intronic or missense, have been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and related complications. For example, SNPs like IVS3+nt460 A>G, IVS3+nt437 C>T, and E197G A>G are associated with diabetic neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and macrovascular disease in Italian populations with type 2 diabetes.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The protein contains a PDZ domain, which is crucial for protein-protein interactions. Variants affecting this domain could disrupt its role as a transcriptional co-activator or its function in proteasome assembly, potentially influencing metabolic or cell-cycle regulation pathways.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between specific SNPs and complex disease phenotypes is generally considered a risk association rather than a deterministic link.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **rs14259 (E197G):** This SNP (A>G) has been studied in relation to diabetic complications. The G allele was found at a significantly higher frequency in Turkish patients with diabetic sensory polyneuropathy compared to controls. This variant is also linked to diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and hypercholesterolemia in Italian T2D families.\n*   **IVS3+nt460 A>G:** This intronic SNP is linked to diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, hypercholesterolemia, and macrovascular complications in Italian individuals with type 2 diabetes. It is also associated with carpal tunnel syndrome in the same population.\n*   **IVS3+nt437 C>T:** This intronic SNP is also associated with diabetic neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy, hypercholesterolemia, and macrovascular disease in Italian T2D families.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** PSMD9 is ubiquitously expressed, with particularly high levels noted in the pancreas (islets of Langerhans), endocrine tissues, lymphatic tissues, kidney, and skin. High expression is also seen in various parts of the brain.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in pancreatic beta-cells is consistent with its proposed role in insulin secretion and diabetes. Expression in neuronal tissues aligns with associations with diabetic neuropathy and potential roles in neurodegenerative diseases. Its expression in a wide range of tissues reflects its fundamental role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** As a core component of the proteasome, PSMD9 is essential throughout development and life for protein quality control. Alterations in its function could contribute to age-related diseases where protein homeostasis is compromised, such as neurodegeneration and cancer.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** PSMD9 acts as a chaperone for the assembly of the 19S regulatory particle of the 26S proteasome and also functions as a transcriptional co-activator, notably for the insulin gene.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary proposed mechanism involves altered gene function or expression leading to dysregulation of pathways, rather than a classic monogenic mechanism like haploinsufficiency. For example, variants may affect its role in modulating insulin transcription, contributing to beta-cell dysfunction in T2D.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of PSMD9 can compromise the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. It can also affect NF-\u03baB signaling, impacting inflammatory responses, and alter transcription of key genes like insulin, contributing to metabolic diseases.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** PSMD9 interacts with proteasomal chaperones like PSMC3 and PSMC6 for proteasome assembly. As a transcriptional co-activator (\"bridge-1\"), it interacts with factors like PDX-1, E12, and E47 to regulate insulin gene transcription.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for PSMD9 is not standard for diagnosing monogenic disorders. Its utility is currently in research settings to understand risk for complex diseases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is performed in research studies investigating the genetic underpinnings of type 2 diabetes, its complications, and certain cancers.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, genetic findings in PSMD9 do not typically alter clinical management, which is guided by the patient's clinical phenotype (e.g., managing blood glucose in diabetes). However, understanding its role in cancer may lead to future therapeutic strategies.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For complex diseases, counseling would focus on the concept of genetic risk factors rather than deterministic mutations. SNPs in PSMD9 would be considered as one of many factors contributing to an individual's overall risk for conditions like type 2 diabetes.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Gragnoli C. (2011), *J Diabetes Complications*, 25(5):329-31.** Established a link between PSMD9 SNPs (IVS3+nt460, IVS3+nt437, E197G) and diabetic neuropathy in Italian families with T2D. [Referenced in 6]\n*   **Gragnoli C. (2011), *Diabetes Res Clin Pract*, 94(2):e47-9.** Showed that the same PSMD9 SNPs are linked to carpal tunnel syndrome in Italian type 2 diabetics.\n*   **Hopper JL, et al. (2015), *AIMS Mol Sci*, 2(4):476-484.** A comprehensive review discussing the molecular and genetic data linking PSMD9 to diabetes, cancer, mental health, PCOS, and neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   **Ozkaya E, et al. (2019), *Bratisl Lek Listy*, 120(9):680-684.** Investigated the rs14259 polymorphism and found a significant association between the G allele and a higher risk of diabetic sensory polyneuropathy in Turkish patients.\n*   **Langlands et al. (2019), *Oncol Lett*, 17(1):1199-1206.** Found that low PSMD9 expression in breast cancer tumors was associated with fewer local recurrences after radiotherapy.\n*   **Luo et al. (2024), *CNS Neurosci Ther*, 30(2):e14366.** Identified PSMD9 as an independent prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target in glioblastoma, showing its knockdown inhibited cancer cell proliferation and migration.\n*   **Watanabe TK, et al. (1998), *Genomics*, 50(2):241-50.** The initial cloning and characterization of the human PSMD9 gene, then called p27. [Referenced in 2, 3]\n*   **Thomas MK, et al. (1999), *Mol Cell Biol*, 19(12):8492-504.** Identified the protein as \"Bridge-1\" and described its role as a coactivator for E2A-mediated regulation of insulin gene transcription. [Referenced in 2]\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** At present, associations are primarily with risk SNPs for complex diseases rather than causative variants for monogenic disorders. The strongest evidence links SNPs like rs14259 (E197G) and intronic variants (IVS3+nt460, IVS3+nt437) to a higher risk of phenotypes associated with type 2 diabetes.\n    *   **Diabetic neuropathy (HP:0000758):** Strongly associated with the 'G' allele of rs14259 and the IVS3+nt460/nt437 SNPs in diabetic populations.\n    *   **Diabetic retinopathy (HP:0100650) and Diabetic nephropathy (HP:0001944):** Also linked to the IVS3+nt460/nt437 SNPs in T2D patients.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** A combination of **Type II diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978)** with multiple microvascular and macrovascular complications, particularly severe **diabetic neuropathy**, in the absence of other strong risk factors, might suggest a higher-than-average genetic risk contribution that could involve genes like PSMD9.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotypes associated with PSMD9 are broad and common. The primary differential diagnosis is simply type 2 diabetes and its complications arising from environmental and other genetic factors. For cancer-related phenotypes like glioblastoma, PSMD9 is one of many genes whose expression levels can influence prognosis.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PSMD9 (1/1):\nN/A. Variant: 12:121899753 A>T | Gene: PSMD9 | GT: 1|0 | IDs: rs143562133 | AF: 1KG=0.0004, gnomAD=0.0005, gnomADg=0.0003 | ACMG: Uncertain significance (PM1) | ClinVar: N/A | Scores: SIFT=0.0100, Polyphen=0.8970, CADD=23.6000, REVEL=0.1630, SpliceAI=PSMD9 (AG=0.00, AL=0.00, DG=0.00, DL=0.01), DANN=0.9834, MetalR=0.0364 | Alpha Missense: 0.0854 (B) | OMIM: N/A",
        "NBPF12": "NBPF12 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 24297\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 608607\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While not definitively linked to a single Mendelian disorder, copy number variations (CNVs) in the 1q21.1 region, which includes *NBPF12*, are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and congenital anomalies. These include microcephaly, macrocephaly, autism, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and congenital heart disease. The gene is also implicated in various cancers, including neuroblastoma.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance is currently considered limited or uncertain for single nucleotide variants, as most associations are with larger copy number variations in the 1q21.1 region.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The phenotypes associated with 1q21.1 CNVs are typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. However, due to variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance, individuals with the same CNV can present with a wide range of clinical features or be unaffected.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** As of the latest gnomAD release (v4.0), specific constraint metrics for *NBPF12* are not readily available or may be difficult to interpret due to the gene's location within a region of complex segmental duplications. Such regions often pose challenges for accurate variant calling and annotation.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Generally, a high pLI (close to 1) and a low LOEUF score suggest a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variation and may be associated with a dominant disease. The absence of these scores for *NBPF12* prevents a definitive interpretation of its tolerance to variation.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Given the association with CNVs, deletions or duplications of the gene are the most well-documented pathogenic variant classes. The role of missense, nonsense, or splice site variants in causing disease is not yet clearly established.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** The following HPO terms are associated with the 1q21.1 CNV syndromes that include *NBPF12*:\n    *   HP:0001249 - Intellectual disability\n    *   HP:0000252 - Microcephaly\n    *   HP:0000256 - Macrocephaly\n    *   HP:0001627 - Abnormal heart morphology (Congenital heart disease)\n    *   HP:0007364 - Autism spectrum disorder\n    *   HP:0001256 - Spasticity\n    *   HP:0000750 - Delayed speech and language development\n    *   HP:0001508 - Failure to thrive\n    *   HP:0001263 - Global developmental delay\n    *   HP:0000478 - Abnormality of the eye\n    *   HP:0000316 - Hypertelorism\n    *   HP:0000520 - Proptosis\n    *   HP:0000431 - Wide nasal bridge\n    *   HP:0000453 - Long philtrum\n    *   HP:0000218 - High palate\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Less commonly documented but associated HPO terms include:\n    *   HP:0001631 - Atrial septal defect\n    *   HP:0001639 - Ventricular septal defect\n    *   HP:0002123 - Seizures\n    *   HP:0002376 - Developmental regression\n    *   HP:0004322 - Short stature\n    *   HP:0011451 - Sensorineural hearing impairment\n    *   HP:0000175 - Cleft palate\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The associated phenotypes are typically congenital or have an infantile or early childhood onset.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with 1q21.1 CNVs is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to individuals with severe intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Deletions and duplications (CNVs) of the 1q21.1 region are the primary variant class with established, albeit variable, phenotype associations. Microdeletions are often linked to microcephaly, while microduplications are more commonly associated with macrocephaly.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** *NBPF12* contains multiple copies of the DUF1220/Olduvai domain. The copy number of these domains has been linked to brain size and cognitive evolution, suggesting a dosage-dependent effect.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is considered moderate for CNVs, but with significant variability and incomplete penetrance. The correlation for specific single-nucleotide variants is currently weak or unknown.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** Specific pathogenic single-nucleotide variants in *NBPF12* with clear phenotype correlations are not well-documented in the literature. The primary examples relate to CNVs, such as the association of 1q21.1 microdeletions with microcephaly and developmental delay.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   ClinVar lists variants in the 1q21.1-21.2 region, often encompassing multiple genes including *NBPF12*. Specific pathogenic single-nucleotide variants within *NBPF12* itself are not well-characterized. For instance, a duplication of chr1:145,804,679-147,735,815 (GRCh37) has been reported, but its direct correlation to a specific phenotype is part of the broader 1q21.1 duplication syndrome.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** *NBPF12* shows the highest expression in the stomach, with notable expression in the thymus, brain, and testis. Its expression in the brain is consistent with the neurological phenotypes observed in 1q21.1 CNV syndromes.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The brain expression aligns with the observed phenotypes of intellectual disability, developmental delay, and autism. Cardiac expression may be relevant to the congenital heart defects seen in some individuals with 1q21.1 CNVs.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression patterns during development are not well-defined but are presumed to be critical for brain and other organ development, given the congenital nature of the associated phenotypes.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *NBPF12* is a member of the Neuroblastoma Breakpoint Family and is thought to play a role in neurogenesis and brain evolution through the expansion of its DUF1220/Olduvai domains.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary disease mechanism appears to be haploinsufficiency (in the case of deletions) or a gene dosage effect (in the case of duplications) of one or more genes within the 1q21.1 region, including *NBPF12*.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of *NBPF* genes is hypothesized to impact signaling pathways crucial for neuronal proliferation and migration during brain development, leading to abnormalities in brain size and function. The exact pathways are still under investigation.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** *NBPF12* is known to interact with other NBPF family members and proteins such as PPIAL4A. These interactions are likely important for its function, but their direct link to specific phenotypes is not yet fully understood.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for pathogenic variants in *NBPF12* is primarily through chromosomal microarray analysis detecting CNVs in the 1q21.1 region in individuals with developmental delay, intellectual disability, or congenital anomalies.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is typically performed as part of a broader genetic evaluation for developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, or multiple congenital anomalies, often via chromosomal microarray.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Management is supportive and focused on the specific phenotypes present in the individual, such as early intervention services for developmental delay, monitoring for seizures, and surgical correction of congenital heart defects.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling for 1q21.1 CNVs should address the wide range of possible phenotypes, incomplete penetrance, and variable expressivity. Recurrence risk is typically 50% for an autosomal dominant condition, but de novo events are also common.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 31441433, Year: 2020:** Highlighted that the driver of Olduvai domain expansion, a key feature of *NBPF* genes, remains active, suggesting a mechanism for the recurrent 1q21 rearrangements.\n*   **PMID: 34667634, Year: 2021:** A case report supporting the association between *NBPF* genes and the clinical features of 1q21 copy number variation disorders, including developmental delay and congenital heart disease.\n*   **PMID: 16823392, Year: 2006:** A foundational study linking DUF1220 domains, present in multiple copies in *NBPF* genes, to human brain evolution.\n*   **PMID: 32099071, Year: 2020:** Research on NBPF15, a related family member, elucidated properties of the N-terminal region, which is also present in NBPF12, suggesting potential roles in protein aggregation and phase transition.\n*   **PMID: 22535790, Year: 2012:** An important study demonstrating the linear association between Olduvai domain copy number and brain size, providing a potential explanation for the macrocephaly/microcephaly phenotypes in 1q21 CNVs.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   1q21.1 microdeletion (encompassing *NBPF12*) \u2192 Microcephaly (HP:0000252), Global developmental delay (HP:0001263), Intellectual disability (HP:0001249)\n    *   1q21.1 microduplication (encompassing *NBPF12*) \u2192 Macrocephaly (HP:0000256), Global developmental delay (HP:0001263), Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0007364)\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The co-occurrence of intellectual disability or developmental delay with either microcephaly or macrocephaly should raise strong suspicion for a 1q21.1 CNV involving *NBPF12*.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotypes associated with 1q21.1 CNVs overlap with numerous other genetic syndromes. Differential diagnoses should include other recurrent microdeletion/microduplication syndromes and monogenic causes of intellectual disability, autism, and abnormal head size.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in NBPF12 (1/1):\nN/A.

This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a likely mechanism of disease for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Unknown. Given the tolerance to LoF variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might act via a gain-of-function or dominant-negative mechanism, though there is no current evidence for this.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No HPO terms are associated with pathogenic variants in USP17L17 in major clinical or literature databases.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms have been documented.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable, as no associated disease has been described.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** No genotype-phenotype correlations have been established.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Not applicable.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable.\n*   **Examples:** No specific variants have been correlated with specific phenotypes.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No variants classified as \"Pathogenic\" or \"Likely Pathogenic\" for a Mendelian disorder are reported in ClinVar for USP17L17.

Moderate expression is seen in the esophagus and gallbladder.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Due to the lack of a known disease association, any expected tissue-specific phenotypes are purely speculative based on expression patterns (e.g., related to male fertility or placental function).\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Data on developmental expression patterns are not available.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes ubiquitin from specific proteins, which is predicted to regulate processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell migration.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** No disease mechanism has been identified. The high tolerance to LoF variants makes haploinsufficiency an unlikely cause of disease.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The gene is involved in protein deubiquitination pathways. However, the specific phenotypic consequences of disrupting these pathways via USP17L17 variation are unknown.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** While USP17 family members interact with various proteins, no specific interactions have been directly linked to a clinical phenotype for USP17L17.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield is effectively zero, as this gene is not associated with a known disease phenotype.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** This gene is not typically tested for as a primary diagnostic target. Variants may be identified incidentally on large sequencing panels or exome/genome sequencing.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are no clinical actionability or management guidelines associated with variants in this gene.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counselors should note the lack of evidence for any disease association.

It has also been mentioned in studies related to familial obesity and autism.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of GDPD4 is still being investigated, and it does not currently have a definitive, strong, or moderate evidence classification from major clinical genetics bodies.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The mode of inheritance for conditions potentially associated with GDPD4 has not been definitively established.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** A search for GDPD4 on gnomAD v2.1.1 shows a pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) score of 0.00, suggesting it is tolerant to loss-of-function variants. The LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction) score is 1.13. pRec and pNull values are not readily available.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The very low pLI score and a LOEUF score greater than 1 suggest that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in GDPD4 are generally tolerated in the general population and the gene is not under strong constraint against this type of variation.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be of a different class, such as missense with a gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect, although this is speculative.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As GDPD4 is not yet linked to a well-defined syndrome, a ranked list of HPO terms is not available. However, based on its associations, relevant HPO terms would fall under broader categories.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Less common but potentially relevant HPO terms are also not well-defined due to the lack of established disease correlation.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Information regarding the typical age of onset for any potential GDPD4-related phenotype is not currently available.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The spectrum of severity for phenotypes associated with GDPD4 variants has not been characterized.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** There are currently no established correlations between specific classes of GDPD4 variants and distinct phenotypes.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No specific phenotype patterns have been linked to variants in particular domains of the GDPD4 protein.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlation for GDPD4 is currently considered weak to non-existent due to a lack of sufficient clinical and genetic evidence.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** No specific, well-documented examples of a GDPD4 variant leading to a defined phenotype are available in public databases like ClinVar.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n\n*   A search of ClinVar did not reveal any variants in GDPD4 that are classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic with associated clinical phenotypes and HPO terms. There are many variants of uncertain significance listed.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal, GDPD4 shows significantly high expression in the testis. It also has some expression in the vagina, though at lower levels.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in the testis suggests a potential role in male fertility or development, as has been observed in mouse models where it may be involved in male germ cell differentiation.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Expression data from human fetal samples indicates the presence of GDPD4 during development.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** GDPD4 is predicted to have glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity, suggesting a role in lipid metabolism.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism by which GDPD4 variants might cause disease is unknown. Given its tolerance to inactivation, haploinsufficiency is an unlikely mechanism.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The GDPD protein family is involved in choline phospholipid metabolism. Disruption of this pathway could potentially alter cellular signaling and membrane composition, but specific consequences related to GDPD4 are not yet understood.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** GDPD4 is part of a family of glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases, but specific interactions relevant to human phenotypes have not been detailed.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** There is no reported diagnostic yield for GDPD4 in clinical cohorts, as it is not routinely tested for specific disorders.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for GDPD4 is generally not performed for diagnostic purposes but may be included in large-scale research sequencing panels.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are currently no known clinical management guidelines or actionable interventions related to GDPD4 variants.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the lack of confirmed disease association and the high tolerance to variation, counseling for variants of uncertain significance in GDPD4 would emphasize the current lack of evidence for pathogenicity.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\n*   At present, there are no landmark clinical papers that have established a definitive genotype-phenotype correlation for GDPD4. Much of the available information comes from large-scale genomic studies and expression analyses rather than clinical case reports focused on this specific gene. A 2012 study on choline metabolism mentioned GDPD4's role in male germ cell differentiation in mice, which is consistent with its high expression in the testis.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence associations between specific HPO terms and GDPD4 variants.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are no specific HPO terms that would strongly suggest pathogenic variants in GDPD4 at this time.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Due to the non-specific and unconfirmed nature of its disease associations, GDPD4 is not typically included in differential diagnoses for specific syndromes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in GDPD4 (2/2):\nN/A.

Therefore, standard constraint metrics like pLI and LOEUF are not available for this gene.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The absence of constraint scores indicates that there is insufficient data to determine if the gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variation. This makes it challenging to predict the likely pathogenicity of novel variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Without established disease associations or constraint data, it is difficult to predict which variant classes are most likely to be pathogenic. Analysis would rely on variant-specific predictions and any emerging case evidence.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are definitively associated with POTEB3 in major databases like OMIM or ClinVar.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are currently documented for POTEB3.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** There is no information available regarding the age of onset for any potential POTEB3-related phenotype.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The spectrum of severity, if any, associated with POTEB3 variants is unknown.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** No consistent genotype-phenotype correlations have been established for POTEB3.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** POTEB3 contains ankyrin repeats, which are involved in protein-protein interactions.

UniProt lists several natural variants, but their clinical significance and associated phenotypes are not specified.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** Currently, no variants in POTEB3 have strong evidence linking them to a specific phenotype.\n*   **Novel Variants from Recent Case Reports:** A search of recent literature did not identify any case reports describing novel POTEB3 variants associated with distinct clinical phenotypes.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to the Human Protein Atlas, which integrates data from sources like GTEx, POTEB3 shows some expression in the testis and primordial germ cells. However, expression levels are generally low across most tissues.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given the expression pattern, one might speculate about a potential role in male fertility or germ cell development, but this is entirely hypothetical without further evidence.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Detailed information on the developmental expression of POTEB3 is not readily available.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** POTEB3 is a member of the POTE ankyrin domain family and is predicted to be involved in protein-protein interactions.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism for POTEB3, if any, is unknown. Haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative, or gain-of-function effects have not been described.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The specific cellular or molecular pathways that might be disrupted by POTEB3 variants and lead to phenotype consequences are not known.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** POTEB3 is known to bind to other proteins, but the specific interactions and their relevance to any potential phenotype are not yet understood.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for POTEB3 in clinical cohorts is expected to be extremely low to none, as it is not currently associated with any known disease.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for this gene would likely only occur in a research setting or as part of a large gene panel where its inclusion is not based on a specific phenotype.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are currently no known clinical actionability or management implications associated with variants in POTEB3.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling would be challenging due to the lack of information. Counseling would focus on the uncertainty of the findings and the absence of a known disease association.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\n*   A comprehensive search of PubMed and other literature databases did not yield any key clinical studies or landmark papers that have established genotype-phenotype correlations for POTEB3. The existing literature primarily focuses on the evolutionary and genomic characteristics of the POTE gene family.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** There are currently no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for POTEB3.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are no known \"red flag\" HPO terms that would strongly suggest the presence of a pathogenic variant in POTEB3.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Due to the lack of a defined phenotype, it is not possible to list genes for differential diagnosis.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in POTEB3 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "TRIM73": "TRIM73 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 18162\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 612549\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Williams-Beuren Syndrome, Bardet-Biedl Syndrome 11\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for clinical significance is still emerging and not definitively established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Likely autosomal dominant, given its location within the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI:** A pLI score \u2265 0.9 suggests a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function mutations.\n*   **LOEUF:** The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) score is a continuous metric of a gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variation. A lower LOEUF score indicates greater intolerance. For gnomAD v4.0, a recommended threshold of LOEUF < 0.6 is suggested for identifying constrained genes.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** High pLI scores and low LOEUF scores suggest that loss-of-function variants in a gene are likely to be pathogenic.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For genes intolerant to loss-of-function, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants are most likely to be pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As TRIM73 is associated with Williams-Beuren Syndrome, primary HPO terms would likely include those characteristic of this syndrome. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for clinical abnormalities.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Further research is needed to delineate a specific and comprehensive list of secondary HPO terms directly attributed to TRIM73 variants.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Given its association with a developmental syndrome, phenotypes are expected to manifest from birth or early childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes can be broad, as is typical for contiguous gene deletion syndromes like Williams-Beuren Syndrome.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific correlations for TRIM73 are not yet well-established in the literature. However, for many genetic disorders, the type of variant can influence the phenotype.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The TRIM73 protein contains a RING finger, a B-box-type zinc finger, and a coiled-coil region (RBCC motif), which are common to the TRIM protein family. The specific function and phenotypic consequences of variants in these domains of TRIM73 are not yet detailed.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Currently, the strength of genotype-phenotype correlations for TRIM73 is not well-defined.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No specific pathogenic variants in TRIM73 are extensively characterized in ClinVar or OMIM with detailed phenotype associations at this time.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** According to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, which provides data on gene expression across multiple tissues, TRIM73 is expressed in the stomach, cerebellum, and other tissues.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The clinical relevance of tissue-specific expression is still under investigation.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The role of TRIM73 expression during development is not yet fully understood.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** TRIM73 is predicted to have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, playing a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** As TRIM73 is located within the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region, the likely disease mechanism is haploinsufficiency resulting from a deletion.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** As an E3 ubiquitin ligase, TRIM73 is likely involved in protein turnover and regulation of various cellular processes. Disruption of these processes could lead to the developmental abnormalities seen in Williams-Beuren syndrome.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The TRIM family of proteins is known to be involved in a wide range of cellular functions, including immunity and development.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for single-gene analysis of TRIM73 is not established. Testing is typically performed as part of a panel or whole-exome/genome sequencing for developmental disorders.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is most relevant for patients with clinical features of Williams-Beuren syndrome or other developmental disorders with overlapping phenotypes.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** A pathogenic variant in TRIM73 would support a diagnosis of Williams-Beuren syndrome, guiding appropriate clinical management and surveillance.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling for pathogenic variants in TRIM73 would involve discussing the features of Williams-Beuren syndrome, its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and the implications for family members.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   As of now, there are no landmark publications that focus specifically on establishing genotype-phenotype correlations for the TRIM73 gene alone. Most information is derived from its inclusion in the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** High-confidence associations are not yet established for TRIM73 as a single gene. Phenotypes are associated with the broader Williams-Beuren syndrome deletion.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** A constellation of HPO terms characteristic of Williams-Beuren syndrome should raise suspicion of a deletion involving TRIM73.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of Williams-Beuren syndrome can overlap with other neurodevelopmental and connective tissue disorders.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in TRIM73 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "FRMD4B": "FRMD4B Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: FRMD4B**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID**: HGNC:24886.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID**: 617467.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations**: Associations have been identified with complex multifactorial diseases, including advanced heart failure and celiac disease. No definitive monogenic disease has been associated with this gene.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: Moderate evidence for association with complex diseases (advanced heart failure, celiac disease). No evidence for a role in monogenic disease.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients**: Not applicable in a Mendelian sense; common variants show association with disease risk in populations.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: Specific gnomAD constraint scores for FRMD4B were not identified in the search results.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: Constraint metrics like pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) and LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) quantify a gene's tolerance to inactivating variants. A high pLI (>0.9) or low LOEUF suggests a gene is intolerant to haploinsufficiency and is more likely to be associated with a dominant Mendelian disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Based on current literature, pathogenic variants for a monogenic disorder have not been established. Disease associations are with non-coding (intronic) or regulatory variants that may alter gene expression. Exonic variants have not been significantly associated with disease phenotypes in studied cohorts.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**: No specific HPO terms are consistently associated with monogenic variants in *FRMD4B*. The primary clinical associations are with complex diseases, not specific, syndromic phenotypes.\n    *   Associated with advanced heart failure.\n    *   Associated with ischemic heart failure.\n    *   Associated with celiac disease.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**: No secondary HPO terms associated with monogenic variants in *FRMD4B* were found in the search results.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: The associated complex diseases (heart failure, celiac disease) typically have an adult onset.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: For associated heart failure, the phenotype is typically advanced/severe.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: Intronic variants are associated with risk for advanced heart failure and celiac disease. A study that resequenced all coding exons failed to find any association between exonic variants and heart failure.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: No correlations between specific protein domains and phenotypes have been established.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: Weak. The identified associations are for common, non-coding SNPs with modest effect sizes on complex disease risk, not causative variants for a monogenic disorder.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes**:\n    *   The minor allele of the intronic SNP rs6787362 is associated with a protective effect against advanced heart failure, particularly ischemic heart failure, in Caucasian populations.\n    *   The risk allele (T) of the SNP rs6806528, located near *FRMD4B*, is associated with an increased risk for celiac disease and correlates with increased *FRMD4B* gene expression.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for a monogenic disorder are reported in ClinVar. The following are common variants associated with complex disease risk.\n*   **rs6787362** / Intronic / Association / Protective for advanced heart failure / The minor allele frequency was lower in heart failure cases than in controls.\n*   **rs6806528** / Intergenic / Association / Risk factor for celiac disease / The risk allele increases *FRMD4B* expression.\n*   **rs922948** / Intergenic / Association / Celiac disease.\n*   **rs7648449** / Intergenic / Association / Celiac disease.\n*   **rs1483890** / Intronic / Association / Celiac disease.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation**: *FRMD4B* shows eQTLs in cells from transformed fibroblasts and the aorta. High expression in the aorta has potential clinical correlation with the observed association with ischemic heart failure.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: The gene is also expressed in the sural nerve, Achilles tendon, and corpus callosum, although no specific phenotypes have been linked to these tissues.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: Mouse ortholog expression has been observed during preimplantation development.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: *FRMD4B* encodes a scaffolding protein that is part of signaling complexes recruited in response to insulin receptor signaling and is involved in establishing epithelial cell polarity.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The mechanism does not appear to be haploinsufficiency. For celiac disease, the mechanism may be related to altered gene dosage, as a risk variant leads to increased *FRMD4B* expression. For heart failure, the intronic location of the associated SNP suggests a regulatory mechanism.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: The protein functions by connecting ARF6 activation with the PAR3 complex to regulate cell polarity. It interacts with CYTH3, an effector of PI-3 kinase signaling, a pathway with broad cellular impact. Disruption could affect cell adhesion and signaling, potentially contributing to cardiovascular or autoimmune pathologies.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: Interacts with PARD3 at adherens and tight junctions. Interacts with CYTH3 (by similarity).\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: The diagnostic yield for *FRMD4B* variants as a cause of Mendelian disease is expected to be zero based on current evidence.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: Testing is currently performed in a research context for genome-wide association studies of complex traits like heart failure and celiac disease.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: There is no direct clinical actionability based on *FRMD4B* genotype alone. Associated variants may contribute to polygenic risk scores in the future.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling would focus on the distinction between low-penetrance risk alleles for complex diseases versus high-penetrance pathogenic variants that cause Mendelian disorders.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 20124441** (Cappola TP, et al., 2010): Established the first association between an intronic SNP (rs6787362) in *FRMD4B* and advanced heart failure, particularly of ischemic etiology.\n*   **PMID: 20718813** (Matkovich SJ, et al., 2010): Confirmed the association of the intronic SNP rs6787362 with ischemic heart failure but found no association for any exonic *FRMD4B* variants after resequencing, suggesting a non-coding regulatory mechanism.\n*   **PMID: 24999842** (Garner C, et al., 2014): A genome-wide association study that confirmed *FRMD4B* as a new susceptibility locus for celiac disease.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**: There are currently no known high-confidence associations between specific HPO terms and pathogenic variants in *FRMD4B* for any monogenic disease.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags**: A clinical picture of advanced ischemic heart failure may be a \"red flag\" for investigating the role of common variant rs6787362 for research or risk score purposes, but not for diagnosing a monogenic condition. A diagnosis of celiac disease is associated with several common variants in or near the gene.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**: For patients with heart failure or celiac disease, the differential diagnosis would include numerous other genetic and environmental factors that contribute to these complex conditions. *FRMD4B* variants are only a small component of the overall risk.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in FRMD4B (2/2):\nN/A.

        "HLA-DRB5": "HLA-DRB5 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:4953.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 604776.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** HLA-DRB5 is primarily associated with modifying susceptibility to and severity of various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases rather than causing a monogenic disorder. Associations include multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sarcoidosis, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. It is also implicated in skin cutaneous melanoma prognosis and adverse drug reactions.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for HLA-DRB5's role as a genetic risk modifier is strong for several conditions, particularly multiple sclerosis. It is not typically classified as a definitive disease-causing gene for Mendelian disorders.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Inheritance is autosomal codominant, following Mendelian patterns for HLA haplotypes. Specific alleles are inherited as part of haplotypes with certain *HLA-DRB1* alleles.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v4.0 does not provide constraint metrics for HLA genes due to their high polymorphism and complex nature, which makes the standard models for calculating pLI and LOEUF unreliable. Earlier versions of gnomAD also excluded this gene from constraint calculations.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The absence of constraint scores reflects the extreme allelic diversity and specialized function of HLA genes, not a tolerance to loss-of-function in a typical sense. Pathogenicity is determined by specific allele effects on immune recognition rather than gene inactivation.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Allelic variants (missense) that alter the structure of the peptide-binding groove are most likely to have functional consequences and be associated with disease risk. Null alleles, such as in *HLA-DRB5\\*null*, are also functionally significant, influencing disease severity in conditions like MS.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As *HLA-DRB5* is primarily a risk modifier, it is not directly linked to a standard set of HPO terms describing a single disorder. Instead, it is associated with phenotypes of complex diseases such as:\n    *   Multiple sclerosis (HP:0001336)\n    *   Systemic lupus erythematosus (HP:0002725)\n    *   Sarcoidosis (HP:0002106)\n    *   Rheumatoid arthritis (HP:0000922)\n    *   Preeclampsia (HP:0001659)\n    *   Alzheimer's disease (HP:0002511)\n    *   Type 1 diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Phenotypes associated with specific disease contexts include:\n    *   Pruritus (HP:0000989)\n    *   Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (HP:0007358)\n    *   L\u00f6fgren syndrome (a form of sarcoidosis)\n    *   Presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (HP:0003493)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The age of onset corresponds to the associated complex disease, which can range from childhood (Type 1 diabetes) to adult and late-onset (MS, RA, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease).\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The presence or absence of certain *HLA-DRB5* alleles can modify disease severity. For example, the presence of *HLA-DRB5* may attenuate the severity of MS, while *HLA-DRB5\\*null* is associated with a more progressive disease course.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Allelic Variants:** Specific alleles, such as *HLA-DRB5\\*01:01*, are part of the haplotype strongly associated with multiple sclerosis susceptibility. Other alleles are linked to risk for preeclampsia, SLE, and sarcoidosis.\n    *   **Null Variants:** The *HLA-DRB5\\*null* genotype, found in some African populations, is associated with an increased risk of developing secondary progressive MS when present with the *DRB1\\*1503* allele.\n    *   **Copy Number Variants (CNVs):** Deletions (copy number 0 or 1) of *HLA-DRB5* appear to be protective against systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Chinese Han populations.\n*   **Protein Domain-specific Phenotype Patterns:** Polymorphisms within the exons encoding the peptide-binding groove (exon 2 and 3) determine the repertoire of peptides presented to T-cells, thereby influencing immune responses and disease susceptibility.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** There is a **strong** correlation between the *HLA-DRB1\\*15:01-HLA-DRB5\\*01:01* haplotype and susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. The correlation between specific alleles and other conditions like SLE, sarcoidosis, and preeclampsia is moderate but statistically significant.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   **HLA-DRB5\\*01:01:** Linked with *HLA-DRB1\\*15:01*, it confers strong susceptibility to MS. It is also associated with pruritus in certain populations.\n    *   **rs147440497 (F55Y):** A missense variant in exon 2 associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia in a Chinese population.\n    *   ***HLA-DRB5\\*null*:** In individuals with *HLA-DRB1\\*1503*, this null allele is associated with a higher risk for a progressive MS course.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   ClinVar lists several alleles of *HLA-DRB5* with interpretations ranging from \"risk factor\" to \"uncertain significance\" for various conditions. Because pathogenicity is context-dependent (haplotype and disease), individual variant entries are less common than allele-level associations.\n*   **HLA-DRB5\\*01:01:01** / \"risk factor\" / Associated with Multiple Sclerosis, Sarcoidosis / Part of the common DR15 haplotype.\n*   **HLA-DRB5\\*null** / \"risk factor\" / Associated with increased severity of Multiple Sclerosis in specific haplotype contexts (*DRB1\\*1503*) / Found in individuals of African ancestry.\n*   **rs9268856 (AA genotype):** / \"risk factor\" / Increased risk of sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in a Chinese cohort.\n*   **rs3130288:** / \"risk factor\" / Associated with L\u00f6fgren syndrome (a subtype of sarcoidosis) / Located in the MHC region near *HLA-DRB5*.\n*   **CNV deletion:** / \"protective factor\" / Decreased risk for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** *HLA-DRB5* expression is largely restricted to professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Highest expression is observed in the spleen, with significant expression also in the lung and lymph nodes.\n*   **Tissue-specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its expression in immune cells, phenotypes are primarily immunological. For example, altered antigen presentation in immune cells of the central nervous system contributes to MS pathology. Expression in placental immune cells like dendritic cells and macrophages is relevant to preeclampsia.\n*   **Expression During Development:** Expression is tied to the development and function of the adaptive immune system. It plays a key role in presenting antigens throughout life.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The HLA-DRB5 protein forms a heterodimer that presents processed extracellular peptides to CD4+ T-helper cells, initiating an adaptive immune response.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is altered immune response. Specific alleles change the peptide-binding properties, leading to inappropriate T-cell activation against self-antigens (autoimmunity) or altered responses to foreign antigens. It is not associated with classic haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative mechanisms in Mendelian terms.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   **Antigen Processing and Presentation (hsa04612):** Altered peptide binding affects which self- or foreign-peptides are presented, potentially triggering autoimmune responses in diseases like MS, RA, and SLE.\n    *   **T-cell Receptor Signaling:** Inefficient or aberrant T-cell activation can lead to a failure of immune tolerance (autoimmunity) or altered inflammatory responses.\n    *   **Molecular Mimicry:** A T-cell receptor may recognize both a foreign peptide (e.g., from a virus) presented by one HLA molecule and a self-peptide (e.g., myelin basic protein) presented by an HLA-DRB5 molecule, initiating an autoimmune attack.\n*   **Protein-protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The crucial interaction is between the HLA-DR\u03b1/\u03b25 dimer, the bound peptide, and the T-cell receptor. This trimolecular interaction dictates the downstream immune response.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** *HLA-DRB5* typing is not used for diagnosing a monogenic disease. Its utility is in risk stratification and prognostic assessment for complex autoimmune diseases. For instance, in MS, the presence of the *DRB1\\*15:01-DRB5\\*01:01* haplotype is a major genetic risk factor.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Testing is typically performed as part of HLA typing for transplantation (bone marrow, kidney), and in research contexts to study susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like MS, SLE, and sarcoidosis.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Knowledge of a patient's *HLA-DRB5* status (e.g., *DRB5\\*null*) might inform prognosis in MS, suggesting a higher risk for a progressive course, which could potentially influence long-term monitoring strategies.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling focuses on explaining the concept of genetic risk modification rather than deterministic disease causation. The presence of a risk allele increases susceptibility but does not guarantee disease, and its penetrance is influenced by other genetic and environmental factors.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Oksenberg JR, et al. (2008) J Immunol. PMID: 18849452:** Landmark study in an African American cohort that distinguished the roles of *HLA-DRB1* as the primary MS susceptibility gene and *HLA-DRB5* as a modifier of disease severity.

(2020) Front Immunol. PMID: 32574246:** Developed a capture RNA-seq method to analyze allele-level expression, showing differential RNA levels between haplotypes involving *HLA-DRB5*, which could explain functional differences in disease association.\n*   **Guo H, et al.

PMID: 34858169:** Studied polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes, finding no significant association between the *HLA-DRB5* variant rs17425622 and risk for Parkinson's disease or Multiple System Atrophy in a Chinese population.\n*   **Zhong Y, et al. (2023) Heliyon. PMID: 37063853:** A 2023 study identifying a specific *HLA-DRB5* missense variant (F55Y) as a risk factor for preeclampsia in a Chinese population, highlighting a potential functional impact on the protein structure.\n*   **NCBI GeneRIFs:** Ongoing studies continue to link *HLA-DRB5* variants to a wide range of immune-mediated and neurological diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ALS, Alzheimer's disease, and type 1 diabetes.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   **Multiple sclerosis (HP:0001336)** or **Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (HP:0007358)** strongly suggests investigating the *HLA-DRB1\\*15-DRB5* haplotype, especially the *DRB5\\*null* allele for prognostic context in certain populations.\n    *   **Systemic lupus erythematosus (HP:0002725)** in a patient could be negatively correlated with a deletion CNV of *HLA-DRB5*.\n    *   **Sarcoidosis (HP:0002106)**, particularly the acute form known as **L\u00f6fgren syndrome**, is strongly associated with variants in the MHC class II region including *HLA-DRB5*.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** While no single HPO term is pathognomonic, a clinical picture of **relapsing-remitting central nervous system demyelination** should prompt consideration of the *HLA-DRB1-DRB5* haplotype as a major risk factor. A family history of diverse autoimmune diseases (e.g., MS, RA, SLE) points to the general importance of the HLA region.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotypes associated with *HLA-DRB5* are broad and overlap with numerous other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. The key is that *HLA-DRB5* is a risk locus that interacts with other HLA genes (especially *HLA-DRB1*) and non-HLA genes. Phenotypic overlap is the rule, not the exception, and genetic analysis of the entire HLA region is often required to resolve associations.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in HLA-DRB5 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "COL23A1": "COL23A1 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 22990\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 610043\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While primarily studied in the context of cancer, particularly non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, and clear cell renal cell carcinoma, direct Mendelian disease associations are not well established. A recent study has implicated a variant in *COL23A1* as a risk factor for eczema herpeticum, an atopic dermatitis-associated severe herpes simplex virus infection. The GenCC database currently has no submissions for this gene. OMIM reports no specific gene-phenotype relationships.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for a direct role in Mendelian disease is currently limited or emerging. Its role as a risk factor for eczema herpeticum is based on a single recent study.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The inheritance pattern for its potential role as a risk factor for eczema herpeticum is suggested to be autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance, as a heterozygous SNP was identified.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v4.0 does not provide specific values for pLI, LOEUF, pRec, or pNull for *COL23A1*. It is important to use the most recent version of gnomAD for constraint metrics and to consider the confidence intervals when interpreting these scores. The pLI score is a metric that indicates intolerance to protein-truncating variation, with a score \u2265 0.9 suggesting a gene is highly intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variants. The LOEUF score is a continuous metric, where lower values indicate greater intolerance to LoF variation.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The absence of specific constraint scores from gnomAD for *COL23A1* means that conclusions about its tolerance to inactivation cannot be drawn from these metrics alone. This may be due to factors such as gene length or insufficient power in the dataset.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While no definitive pathogenic variants for Mendelian disease are established in major databases like ClinVar, the research on eczema herpeticum points to a splice donor site SNP (rs2973744) that leads to increased protein expression. In cancer studies, the focus is often on expression levels rather than specific variant classes.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\nAs *COL23A1* has not been definitively linked to a Mendelian disorder, a comprehensive list of HPO terms is not available. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for describing phenotypic abnormalities in human disease.\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** Not applicable as no established Mendelian disease association exists.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Based on the recent study on eczema herpeticum, the following terms could be considered:\n    *   *Eczema herpeticum* (related to severe HSV-1 infection in the context of atopic dermatitis).\n    *   *Atopic dermatitis* (HP:0000964)\n    *   *Recurrent herpes simplex virus infections* (HP:0009804)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** In the context of eczema herpeticum, the onset would align with the typical age of atopic dermatitis and subsequent HSV-1 infection.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of eczema herpeticum can range from localized to disseminated and severe cutaneous infection.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** A heterozygous SNP (rs2973744) at a splice donor site has been associated with an increased risk for eczema herpeticum. This variant is thought to lead to higher levels of COL23A1 protein, which in turn dampens the immune response of keratinocytes to HSV-1.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The function of COL23A1's different domains (N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, transmembrane domain, and extracellular collagenous domains) in disease is still being elucidated. The full-length and shed forms of the protein may have different roles.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between the rs2973744 variant and eczema herpeticum is currently supported by a single study, suggesting the evidence is emerging but not yet strongly established. Further research is needed to validate this finding.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\nThere are currently no variants in ClinVar classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for a Mendelian disorder.\n*   **rs2973744:** A heterozygous SNP at a splice donor site between exons 10 and 11.\n    *   **Significance:** Identified as a risk factor for eczema herpeticum.\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes (HPO terms):** *Atopic dermatitis* (HP:0000964), susceptibility to *Eczema herpeticum*.\n    *   **AF:** Found in 5% of patients with atopic dermatitis and a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH+), 1.6% of healthy controls, and 0% of patients with atopic dermatitis without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-).\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** *COL23A1* is expressed in various tissues, including the skin, lung, brain, kidney, and cornea. The Human Protein Atlas shows high expression in the thyroid gland and heart. Its expression in the skin (epidermis) is relevant to its potential role in eczema herpeticum.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its expression in keratinocytes, variants affecting *COL23A1* function could lead to skin-related phenotypes. Its role in other tissues is less clear in the context of Mendelian disease but is being investigated in cancer.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** *COL23A1* is expressed in developing organs. Mouse models show expression in the heart at embryonic and neonatal stages.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function in One Sentence:** COL23A1 is a type II transmembrane collagen that acts as a ligand for integrin \u03b12\u03b21 and is involved in cell-matrix interactions.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The proposed mechanism for its role in eczema herpeticum is not a classic loss-of-function or gain-of-function, but rather an upregulation of the protein leading to an altered immune response. In cancer, its overexpression is associated with tumor progression and metastasis.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Overexpression of *COL23A1* in keratinocytes leads to the downregulation of genes involved in the immune response (e.g., *IL1R1, TLR4, IRF1*) and an upregulation of genes associated with atopic dermatitis (e.g., *TNC, SPINK5*). This altered immune landscape is thought to increase susceptibility to and severity of HSV-1 infection.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** As a ligand for integrin \u03b12\u03b21, its interactions are crucial for cell adhesion. It may also interact with other extracellular matrix components.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for *COL23A1* variants is not yet standard practice for any Mendelian disorder. The diagnostic yield for eczema herpeticum is currently unknown but is likely low, given the frequency of the identified risk variant.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Currently, testing for this gene is primarily for research purposes, particularly in studies of cancer and, more recently, atopic dermatitis with severe viral complications.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** If the association with eczema herpeticum is confirmed, identifying at-risk individuals could potentially lead to targeted antiviral prophylaxis or immunomodulatory therapies. However, this is speculative at this stage.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the limited data, counseling would focus on the uncertainty of the findings and the potential for a complex, multifactorial inheritance pattern for eczema herpeticum.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 39031206 (Preprint), Year: 2024:** Identified a SNP (rs2973744) in *COL23A1* as a novel risk factor for eczema herpeticum, showing that overexpression of the gene in keratinocytes increases susceptibility to HSV-1 by dampening immune responses.\n*   **PMID: 28852331, Year: 2017:** Demonstrated that *COL23A1* is upregulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and its overexpression is associated with a poorer prognosis. Knockdown of the gene inhibited cancer cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration.\n*   **PMID: 22440398, Year: 2012:** Showed that collagen XXIII contributes to cancer cell metastasis through its function in cell adhesion and that its expression affects other proteins involved in cell structure and adhesion.\n*   **PMID: 20388755, Year: 2010:** Identified collagen XXIII as a potential biomarker for the detection of primary and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.\n*   **PMID: 17878310, Year: 2007:** Described the shedding of collagen XXIII by the protease furin, a process dependent on the plasma membrane microenvironment.\n*   **PMID: 16728390, Year: 2006:** Characterized the expression of type XXIII collagen mRNA and protein, and identified it as a novel ligand for integrin \u03b12\u03b21 in the epidermis.\n*   **PMID: 12644459, Year: 2003:** First identified and cloned type XXIII collagen, describing it as a new member of the transmembrane collagen family.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations. The link between rs2973744 and eczema herpeticum is preliminary.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** A patient with atopic dermatitis presenting with unusually severe or recurrent eczema herpeticum could be a candidate for further investigation of *COL23A1*, although this is not yet standard clinical practice.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotypic overlap would be with other genetic conditions predisposing to severe viral infections or immunodeficiencies affecting skin integrity.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in COL23A1 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "FAM174B": "FAM174B Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: FAM174B**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 34339.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** Not available.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While no definitive monogenic disease is listed in OMIM, FAM174B has been associated with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy. It is also implicated in other complex conditions, including cancer and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for a direct causal role in a specific monogenic disease is currently limited.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** A specific inheritance pattern has not been established due to the lack of a defined Mendelian disease.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v2.1.1 data for the canonical transcript (ENST00000327355) shows a pLI score of 0.00, indicating it is not highly intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The LOEUF is 1.09. These scores suggest the gene is tolerant of LoF variation.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores suggest that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in FAM174B are not a common cause of severe, early-onset Mendelian disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While LoF variants are not highly constrained, specific missense variants or variants with a gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect could potentially be pathogenic. A chromosomal deletion involving FAM174B was associated with a neurobehavioral phenotype, suggesting haploinsufficiency could be a mechanism in some cases.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As no single Mendelian disease is defined, a ranked list of HPO terms is not available. However, clinical cases have linked FAM174B alterations to phenotypes such as:\n    *   Epilepsy.\n    *   Autism spectrum disorder.\n    *   Behavioral abnormalities.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Associations with broader disease categories could imply a role in phenotypes related to:\n    *   Prostate cancer.\n    *   Ovarian serous carcinoma.\n    *   Schizophrenia.\n    *   Blood pressure regulation.\n    *   Increased adiposity.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** A patient with a deletion spanning FAM174B presented with neurodevelopmental issues, suggesting a potential for early-onset phenotypes.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity appears variable, ranging from potential roles in complex psychiatric disorders to association with clinical outcomes in cancer.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** A chromosomal deletion encompassing FAM174B and two other genes was linked to epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and behavioral abnormalities. Indels predicted to damage the gene have been detected in families with schizophrenia.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The gene contains a DUF1180 domain (Protein of unknown function), but no specific phenotype patterns have been correlated with this domain yet.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is currently considered weak to moderate for most associations, as they are often from studies of complex diseases or involve multigenic deletions.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** A missense mutation in the rat ortholog, *Fam174b*, was identified in a genomic interval linked to blood pressure regulation and increased adiposity.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   At present, there are no well-characterized pathogenic or likely pathogenic single nucleotide variants listed in ClinVar for FAM174B that are associated with a specific Mendelian phenotype.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, FAM174B is most highly expressed in the Pancreas. It is also expressed in a wide range of other tissues, including the thyroid, prostate, and various brain regions.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the pancreas could suggest a potential role in pancreatic function or disease. Expression in the prostate is consistent with its implication in prostate cancer. Brain expression may relate to the neurodevelopmental phenotypes observed in a patient with a deletion.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The gene is expressed in human fetal tissues, indicating a role during development.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** FAM174B is essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the Golgi apparatus.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Haploinsufficiency is a potential mechanism, as suggested by a case with a multi-gene deletion. Altered expression levels (both high and low) have been associated with different cancer types and outcomes, suggesting a complex role.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of Golgi structure can impact protein processing, sorting, and transport, leading to widespread cellular dysfunction. Its expression is correlated with molecules involved in mucin production in colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** No specific protein-protein interactions directly linked to a phenotype have been detailed in the search results.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for FAM174B variants is likely low for general genetic testing, as it is not yet definitively linked to a specific Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing may be considered in individuals with complex, unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly if a deletion on chromosome 15q26.1 is detected. It is also a gene of interest in cancer research.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no specific clinical management guidelines based on FAM174B genotype.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would be challenging due to the limited evidence. The uncertain significance of variants and the gene's association with complex, multifactorial diseases would be key discussion points.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 29851555, 2018:** This study uncovered a Golgi-specific transcriptional stress response, highlighting the fundamental role of proteins like FAM174B in Golgi integrity.\n*   **PMID: 21160409, 2011:** A genome-wide survey identified an association between common genetic variants and HIV-1 susceptibility, though the direct role of FAM174B was part of a broader locus.\n*   A 2024 study in *Translational Cancer Research* identified FAM174B as part of a four-gene prognostic model for colorectal mucinous adenocarcinoma and found its expression correlated with mucin production.\n*   A study summarized by the Ma'ayan Laboratory noted that a patient with a chromosomal deletion including FAM174B presented with epilepsy, autism, and behavioral issues.\n*   The same summary mentioned that indels predicted to damage FAM174B were found in families with schizophrenia, and a missense mutation in the rat ortholog was linked to blood pressure and adiposity.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence associations between specific variants and HPO terms.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of **Epilepsy (HP:0001250)**, **Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0000729)**, and **Behavioral abnormalities** in a patient with a 15q26.1 deletion might suggest involvement of FAM174B.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with a FAM174B-inclusive deletion overlap with numerous other syndromic and non-syndromic neurodevelopmental disorders.

        "OR2T8": "OR2T8 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: OR2T8**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:14329\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** Not available in OMIM\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** There are no established disease associations for OR2T8 in OMIM or other major clinical databases.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** No clinical significance has been established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No inheritance patterns have been described as there are no associated diseases.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    *   pLI: 0.00\n    *   LOEUF: 1.13\n    *   pRec: 0.49\n    *   pNull: 0.51\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint scores indicate a high tolerance for loss-of-function variation. The very low pLI score suggests that heterozygous loss-of-function variants are not under strong negative selection in the general population.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, it is unlikely that this class of variants would be pathogenic for a haploinsufficient disease mechanism. There is no information on which variant classes might be pathogenic.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   No human phenotype or HPO terms are currently associated with variants in the OR2T8 gene based on extensive searches of clinical and genetic databases.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   No genotype-phenotype correlations have been reported for the OR2T8 gene.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for OR2T8 are listed in ClinVar. A search of the literature and clinical databases did not identify any characterized variants associated with a clinical phenotype.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal, OR2T8 shows low levels of expression across all tissues analyzed. The highest median expression is observed in the Lung (0.23 TPM).\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Due to its classification as an olfactory receptor, any potential phenotype would theoretically be related to the sense of smell. However, its low expression in olfactory tissue and higher expression in the lung does not support a clear tissue-specific phenotype.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** No data is available on the developmental expression of OR2T8 or any potential association with age-related phenotypes.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** OR2T8 is predicted to function as an odorant receptor involved in the perception of smell.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** No disease mechanism has been described for OR2T8.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** The gene is involved in the olfactory transduction pathway. No specific phenotype consequences of disruption have been documented.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** No protein-protein interactions with known clinical relevance have been reported.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for this gene is effectively zero, as it is not included in standard clinical testing panels for any known phenotype.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** There are currently no clinical indications for testing the OR2T8 gene.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There is no known clinical actionability associated with this gene.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling would focus on the lack of evidence for any disease association and the classification of OR2T8 as a gene of unknown significance.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   A comprehensive search of PubMed and other literature databases did not identify any clinical studies or case reports establishing a correlation between OR2T8 variants and a specific phenotype. The available literature is confined to large-scale genomics or olfactory receptor family studies without individual gene-phenotype details.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** None known.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** None known.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Not applicable.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in OR2T8 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "RASA4": "RASA4 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n- **HGNC ID**: 23181\n- **OMIM Gene ID**: 607943\n- **Primary Disease Associations**: Currently, no definitive disease associations are listed in OMIM for *RASA4*. However, research has identified hypermethylation of *RASA4* in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), correlating with a poorer prognosis.\n- **Clinical Significance Level**: The clinical significance of *RASA4* variants is still being established; there is currently no consensus on a definitive disease association.\n- **Inheritance Patterns**: Given the lack of a defined Mendelian disease, inheritance patterns are not yet established.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n- **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics for *RASA4* (transcript ENST00000262940.9) are:\n    - **pLI**: 0.00, indicating it is not extremely intolerant to protein-truncating variants.\n    - **LOEUF**: 1.13, which does not suggest strong constraint against loss-of-function variants.\n    - **pRec**: 0.69\n    - **pNull**: 0.31\n- **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The low pLI and high LOEUF scores suggest that loss-of-function variants in *RASA4* are generally tolerated in the general population and the gene is not under strong purifying selection.\n- **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: While no definitive pathogenic variants are established for a Mendelian disease, hypermethylation (an epigenetic modification) has been associated with a more aggressive phenotype in JMML.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\nDue to the absence of a defined *RASA4*-related disorder, a comprehensive phenotype spectrum with HPO terms is not available. However, based on its function and associations, potential phenotypes could relate to abnormal signal transduction and cell growth.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n- **Variant Classes and Typical Phenotypes**: Specific genotype-phenotype correlations for *RASA4* variants are not yet established in the context of a Mendelian disorder.\n- **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: The *RASA4* protein contains C2 and PH domains. Variants affecting the C2 domains, which are crucial for plasma membrane association in response to calcium, could potentially disrupt its function in downregulating the Ras-MAPK pathway.\n- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: Currently, there is no established strong genotype-phenotype correlation for *RASA4*.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n- No well-characterized pathogenic variants for a Mendelian disease are listed in ClinVar for *RASA4*. There are numerous variants of uncertain significance and a few benign/likely benign variants reported.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM)**: *RASA4* shows notable expression in skeletal muscle. It is also expressed in various other tissues, including nerve, adipose tissue, and uterus.\n- **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Based on its expression profile, variants in *RASA4* could potentially lead to phenotypes affecting muscle function or other tissues with high expression, although this is speculative.\n- **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: Hypermethylation of a *RASA4* isoform promoter has been linked to older age at diagnosis and poor prognosis in juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal Gene Function**: *RASA4* encodes a calcium-dependent Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) that negatively regulates the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway.\n- **Disease Mechanism**: The primary disease-associated mechanism identified so far is epigenetic. Hypermethylation of the *RASA4* promoter leads to its silencing, which is associated with a more aggressive disease course in JMML. In cervical cancer, reduced *RASA4* expression is linked to increased cell proliferation.\n- **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: Disruption of *RASA4* function leads to dysregulation of the Ras-MAPK pathway, which is a critical pathway for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. This dysregulation can contribute to cancer progression.\n- **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: *RASA4* interacts with Ras proteins, converting them from their active GTP-bound state to the inactive GDP-bound state.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n- **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: Testing for *RASA4* variants is not standard practice for any specific Mendelian disorder at this time.\n- **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: The primary context for clinical investigation of *RASA4* is currently in cancer research, specifically looking at methylation status in JMML as a prognostic marker.\n- **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: Identifying *RASA4* hypermethylation in JMML may indicate a poorer prognosis and a higher risk of relapse after transplantation, potentially influencing treatment decisions.\n- **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Genetic counseling for *RASA4* is not well-defined due to the lack of a clear associated Mendelian disease.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- **Poetsch, A. R., et al. (2014). Epigenetics, 9(9), 1252-1260.** This study identified that hypermethylation of *RASA4* isoform 2 is a recurrent event in JMML and correlates with poor prognostic factors.\n- **Chen, J., et al. (2021). Bioengineered, 12(2), 10174-10186.** This research demonstrated that *RASA4* can inhibit the proliferation of cervical cancer cells by suppressing the HIF\u03b1 signaling pathway.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n- **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**: There are currently no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for *RASA4*.\n- **Phenotype Red Flags**: Given the link to JMML, hematological abnormalities in a pediatric patient might be a consideration, although this is related to methylation rather than a germline variant.\n- **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**: Due to its role in the Ras-MAPK pathway, other RASopathies should be considered in the differential diagnosis if a patient presents with features overlapping with those syndromes, although *RASA4* is not currently classified as a RASopathy gene. An important paralog to consider is *RASA4B*.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in RASA4 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "LMAN1L": "LMAN1L Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n\n*   **HGNC ID:** LMAN1L (HGNC:6632).\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 609548.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While directly causative links to monogenic diseases are not yet firmly established, LMAN1L has been associated with Prostate Cancer and is located within the critical region for Chromosome 15q24 Deletion Syndrome. Its paralog, LMAN1, is associated with a combined deficiency of coagulation factors V and VIII.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for a direct role in a specific monogenic disease is still emerging and could be considered moderate to limited.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Given its potential association with a deletion syndrome, a heterozygous loss-of-function (haploinsufficiency) mechanism is plausible.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Based on its function in protein transport, loss-of-function variants such as nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site variants would be most suspected to be pathogenic. Large deletions encompassing the gene, as seen in 15q24 deletion syndrome, are also clinically significant.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As LMAN1L's direct link to a Mendelian disease is not yet solidified, a definitive list of HPO terms is not available. However, based on the phenotypes observed in the 15q24 deletion syndrome, which includes the LMAN1L gene, and its paralog LMAN1, the following are relevant:\n    *   Intellectual disability\n    *   Delayed speech and language development\n    *   Growth retardation\n    *   Hypotonia\n    *   Seizures\n    *   Microcephaly\n    *   Facial dysmorphism\n    *   Congenital heart defects\n    *   Genital abnormalities\n    *   Hearing impairment\n\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Behavioral problems\n    *   Skeletal abnormalities\n    *   Vision problems\n    *   Recurrent infections\n    *   Abnormal bleeding (inferred from its paralog LMAN1).\n\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The features associated with the 15q24 deletion syndrome are typically congenital or manifest in early infancy and childhood.\n\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with the 15q24 deletion syndrome can be variable.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Deletions of the 15q24 region, which includes LMAN1L, are associated with the broad range of features seen in the 15q24 deletion syndrome. Specific genotype-phenotype correlations for point variants within LMAN1L are not yet well-established.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n\n*   Specific pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in LMAN1L leading to a distinct Mendelian disorder have not been extensively reported in ClinVar. The focus remains on its involvement in the contiguous gene deletion of 15q24.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** LMAN1L shows expression in the prostate, salivary gland, spleen, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The expression in the prostate may be relevant to its association with prostate cancer. Expression in the brain (cerebral cortex, cerebellum) could correlate with the neurological features observed in the 15q24 deletion syndrome.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Based on expression patterns, variants in LMAN1L could potentially contribute to neurological, immune, and reproductive phenotypes.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** LMAN1L encodes a mannose-binding lectin that functions as a cargo receptor in the early secretory pathway, transporting newly synthesized glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC).\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** For the 15q24 deletion syndrome, the likely disease mechanism is haploinsufficiency, where the loss of one copy of the gene contributes to the phenotype.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of LMAN1L function would impair glycoprotein transport. This could affect the proper folding, modification, and secretion of a wide range of proteins, leading to cellular stress and dysfunction in multiple organ systems, consistent with the multisystemic nature of the 15q24 deletion syndrome.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** LMAN1L is a paralog of LMAN1 (also known as ERGIC-53). LMAN1 forms a complex with MCFD2 to transport coagulation factors V and VIII, and deficiency of LMAN1 leads to a bleeding disorder. It is plausible that LMAN1L also interacts with specific cargo proteins, and disruption of these interactions could lead to disease.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** At present, the strongest association is between a deletion of the 15q24 region (which includes LMAN1L) and the constellation of phenotypes associated with the 15q24 deletion syndrome.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The presence of a combination of intellectual disability, growth retardation, microcephaly, and other congenital anomalies should raise suspicion for a chromosomal microdeletion, including the 15q24 region.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of 15q24 deletion syndrome overlaps with numerous other chromosomal microdeletion/duplication syndromes and monogenic disorders associated with intellectual disability and multiple congenital anomalies. Genetic testing, such as chromosomal microarray, is essential for diagnosis.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in LMAN1L (1/1):\nN/A.

        "GOLGA8S": "GOLGA8S Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: GOLGA8S**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 44409\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** Not listed in OMIM, which focuses on phenotypes.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While directly causative pathogenic variants in *GOLGA8S* have not been definitively established to cause a specific Mendelian disease, its location in the 15q11.2 region associates it with disorders involving this cytogenetic band, such as Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome. It is also considered a candidate gene in cohorts of patients with developmental disorders.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for *GOLGA8S* as a disease-causing gene is currently limited, and it would be considered a gene with limited or uncertain clinical evidence.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** As the gene is primarily associated with large copy number variations (deletions) in the 15q11-q13 region, the inheritance is typically de novo or follows the pattern of the larger genomic rearrangement.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** A search of the gnomAD database (v4.0) did not yield specific constraint metrics for *GOLGA8S*. These scores (pLI, LOEUF) are calculated for individual genes, and their absence may reflect low coverage, its location within a complex genomic region, or other data quality issues.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) and the loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) are metrics used to assess a gene's tolerance to inactivating variants. A high pLI (\u22650.9) or a low LOEUF (<0.35 in gnomAD v2) suggests a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variants and is more likely to be associated with a dominant disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given its association with genomic disorders of the 15q11.2 region, large-scale copy number variants (deletions) that include *GOLGA8S* are known to be pathogenic. The pathogenicity of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) or smaller indels within *GOLGA8S* is not well-established.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As *GOLGA8S* is associated with the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome, the primary HPO terms are those linked to this condition:\n    *   Intellectual disability (HP:0001249)\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250)\n    *   Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0000717)\n    *   Schizophrenia (HP:0100753)\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750)\n    *   Motor delay (HP:0001270)\n    *   Muscular hypotonia (HP:0001252)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Less consistently reported phenotypes may include:\n    *   Abnormal facial shape (HP:0001999)\n    *   Microcephaly (HP:0000252)\n    *   Behavioral abnormality (HP:0000708)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes associated with the 15q13.3 deletion syndrome are typically observed from infancy or early childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with 15q13.3 deletions is variable, ranging from mild learning difficulties to severe intellectual disability and refractory epilepsy.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Deletions of the 15q13.3 region, which includes *GOLGA8S* and other genes like *CHRNA7*, are associated with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric phenotypes. There is insufficient data to correlate specific smaller variants within *GOLGA8S* to distinct phenotypes.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** *GOLGA8S* contains a Golgin-A conserved domain. However, no specific phenotype patterns have been linked to variants within this or other domains of the protein.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between large deletions encompassing *GOLGA8S* and neurodevelopmental phenotypes is strong. The correlation for variants solely affecting *GOLGA8S* is currently unknown.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No specific pathogenic or likely pathogenic single-nucleotide variants in *GOLGA8S* are extensively documented in ClinVar with detailed phenotype correlations. The primary pathogenic events are large structural variations. For example, the recurrent 15q13.3 microdeletion is a known pathogenic copy number variant.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** According to GTEx data, *GOLGA8S* is most highly expressed in the testis. Its paralog, *GOLGA8G*, is also highly expressed in the testis. The clinical relevance of this specific expression pattern to the known neurodevelopmental phenotypes is not clear and may suggest other, undiscovered roles.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given the primary associations with neurodevelopmental disorders, altered expression or function in the brain would be expected to contribute to the phenotype, despite the high expression in the testis.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Information on the developmental expression patterns of *GOLGA8S* is not readily available from the search results.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function in One Sentence:** *GOLGA8S* is a protein-coding gene predicted to be involved in Golgi organization and located in the Golgi apparatus.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The phenotypes associated with the 15q13.3 region are thought to be due to haploinsufficiency, where the deletion of one copy of the gene(s) leads to disease.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** *GOLGA8S* is predicted to be involved in Golgi organization. Disruption of Golgi function can impact protein sorting, modification, and transport, which are critical for neuronal function and development. Its paralogs are also involved in the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome pathway. A recent study suggested a role for GOLGA8 proteins in the uptake of antisense oligonucleotides, indicating a function at the plasma membrane or in endocytic pathways.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The search results did not provide specific protein-protein interactions for GOLGA8S relevant to disease phenotypes.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for 15q13.3 microdeletions is a standard part of the diagnostic workup for individuals with developmental delay, intellectual disability, and epilepsy. The yield of detecting this specific deletion in such cohorts is significant. The diagnostic yield for SNVs in *GOLGA8S* is unknown.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is typically done as part of a chromosomal microarray or exome sequencing for patients with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** An individual with a 15q13.3 microdeletion would be monitored for seizures, developmental delays, and psychiatric conditions. Management is supportive and symptomatic.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would involve discussion of the variability in clinical presentation, the possibility of inheritance from an unaffected or mildly affected parent carrying the deletion, and the risk of recurrence in future pregnancies.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 18311144, 2008:** Sharp et al. first described the recurrent 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome associated with mental retardation and seizures.\n*   **PMID: 25529636, 2014:** Antonacci et al. investigated the role of palindromic *GOLGA8* core duplicons in promoting the instability of chromosome 15q13.3, highlighting the architectural basis for the recurrent microdeletion.\n*   **Recent Publications:** No landmark clinical genetics publications focusing specifically on *GOLGA8S* variants and phenotype correlations were identified in the search results from 2020-2025. Research continues to focus on the broader 15q13.3 region.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Large deletions that include *GOLGA8S* are strongly associated with Intellectual disability (HP:0001249), Seizures (HP:0001250), and Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0000717).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The co-occurrence of intellectual disability, epilepsy, and features of autism should raise suspicion for a genomic disorder in the 15q13.3 region.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome overlaps with numerous other genetic conditions that cause intellectual disability and epilepsy. It shares features with other genomic disorders and single-gene disorders affecting neuronal development.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in GOLGA8S (2/2):\nN/A.

        "EPHA5": "EPHA5 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: EPHA5**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 3389\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 600004\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While not definitively linked to a Mendelian disorder, EPHA5 has been associated with susceptibility to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. It has also been implicated in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and certain cancers, including lung, breast, and prostate cancer. There is currently no OMIM gene-phenotype relationship established.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for a direct causative role in a Mendelian disorder is currently limited. Its association with ASD is emerging based on case reports of microduplications.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** A microduplication involving EPHA5 associated with ASD was inherited from a mildly symptomatic father, suggesting a possible dominant inheritance pattern with variable expressivity.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Based on gnomAD v2.1.1, the pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) score for EPHA5 is not high, suggesting it is not under strong selection against haploinsufficiency. The Residual Variation Intolerance Score (RVIS) places it at 6.57%, meaning it is more tolerant to variation than most genes. Specific numeric values for LOEUF, pRec, and pNull are not readily available in the search results but can be looked up in gnomAD.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and higher RVIS suggest that loss-of-function variants in one copy of the EPHA5 gene (haploinsufficiency) are not a common cause of severe developmental disorders. However, this does not rule out the possibility of pathogenic gain-of-function or dominant-negative variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Low-frequency missense variants have been associated with increased susceptibility to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. A gene duplication has been linked to Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0000717 Autism\n    *   HP:0001250 Seizures\n    *   HP:0001249 Intellectual disability\n    *   HP:0000750 Delayed speech and language development (Implied)\n    *   HP:0001263 Global developmental delay (Implied)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   HP:0009830 Peripheral neuropathy\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Neurodevelopmental phenotypes such as ASD are typically identified in early childhood. Susceptibility to paclitaxel-induced neuropathy is relevant in the context of cancer treatment in adults.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotypic spectrum appears to be broad, ranging from mild symptoms in a parent carrier of a microduplication to a more significant ASD phenotype in the child.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Microduplication:** A ~270 kb interstitial microduplication encompassing a large part of the EPHA5 gene has been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder and intellectual disability.\n    *   **Missense Variants:** Low-frequency nonsynonymous variants in the EPHA5 ligand-binding domain have been linked to an increased risk of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.\n    *   **Synonymous Variants:** The common variant rs7349683 has shown an association with sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Missense variants located in the ligand-binding domain of EPHA5 appear to be particularly relevant for the development of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between the EPHA5 microduplication and ASD is based on a single case report, suggesting a moderate but not yet definitive link. The association of certain variants with paclitaxel-induced neuropathy is supported by multiple studies, indicating a moderate to strong correlation.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **rs7349683 (c.1659C>T):** Associated with increased sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.\n*   **~270 kb microduplication at 4q13.1:** Reported in a patient with Autism Spectrum Disorder and intellectual disability.\n*   **Low-frequency nonsynonymous variants:** As a group, these variants in EPHA5, EPHA6, and EPHA8 are associated with a higher risk of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy. Specific pathogenic variants with rsIDs are not detailed in the provided search results. ClinVar lists some variants as likely pathogenic for conditions like lung adenocarcinoma.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** EPHA5 is highly expressed in various brain regions, including the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in the brain is consistent with its implication in neurodevelopmental disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder. Its role in the nervous system also aligns with its association with peripheral neuropathy.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** EPH receptors are known to be involved in developmental events, particularly in the nervous system, which may explain the link to ASD.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** EPHA5 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that binds to ephrin-A ligands on adjacent cells, playing a key role in axon guidance and nervous system development.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:**\n    *   **Altered Gene Dosage:** A microduplication involving EPHA5 suggests that an increased dosage of the gene product may lead to neurodevelopmental phenotypes like ASD.\n    *   **Altered Protein Function:** Missense variants may alter the protein's function, contributing to susceptibility to peripheral neuropathy.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of EPH-ephrin signaling can impair axon guidance and synaptic plasticity, leading to abnormalities in neural circuitry that may manifest as ASD. Altered EPHA5 function may also affect neuronal response to toxic insults like chemotherapy.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** EPHA5 interacts with ephrin-A ligands, particularly EFNA5, to mediate signaling. It also interacts with ATM at sites of DNA repair following radiation, suggesting a role in cellular responses to DNA damage.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for EPHA5 variants in cohorts with neurodevelopmental disorders is likely low but may be increasing with the use of chromosomal microarrays and whole-genome sequencing. A duplication involving only EPHA5 was identified in a patient with ASD.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for EPHA5 variants may be considered in individuals with unexplained Autism Spectrum Disorder, especially if there is a family history of neurodevelopmental conditions. It is also a gene of interest in pharmacogenomic studies of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identifying an EPHA5 variant could help in understanding the genetic basis of a patient's neurodevelopmental disorder. For patients undergoing paclitaxel treatment, certain EPHA5 genotypes might predict the risk of developing peripheral neuropathy, potentially influencing treatment decisions.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For a family with an EPHA5 duplication, counseling would involve discussing the potential for variable expressivity, as seen with the mildly affected father and more significantly affected daughter. The inheritance pattern appears to be autosomal dominant in this case.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 30724859, 2019:** Described a case of a patient with ASD carrying a novel microduplication that only involves the EPHA5 gene, inherited from a mildly symptomatic father.\n*   **PMID: 28835509, 2017:** A study using targeted exon sequencing found that low-frequency nonsynonymous coding variants in EPHA5, EPHA6, and EPHA8 contribute to susceptibility to paclitaxel-induced neuropathy.\n*   **PMID: 28659267, 2017:** This study reported that genetic variation in EPHA genes, including EPHA5, contributes to sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.\n*   **PMID: 25199859, 2015:** Showed that EPHA5 is a functional molecular target in human lung cancer and regulates cellular responses to genotoxic insult.\n*   **New Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Discovered:** The link between an EPHA5-only microduplication and Autism Spectrum Disorder is a recent and significant finding.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:**\n    *   Low-frequency missense variants in EPHA5 are associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy (HP:0009830) in patients treated with paclitaxel.\n    *   A microduplication of EPHA5 is associated with Autism (HP:0000717) and Intellectual disability (HP:0001249).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The co-occurrence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (HP:0000717) and Intellectual Disability (HP:0001249) should prompt consideration of genomic rearrangements involving the 4q13.1 locus where EPHA5 resides.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The neurodevelopmental phenotypes associated with EPHA5 can overlap with a wide range of other genetic syndromes. Therefore, a comprehensive genetic evaluation, including chromosomal microarray and/or whole-exome/genome sequencing, is often necessary.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in EPHA5 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "GPR89B": "GPR89B Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Clinical Genetics Dossier: GPR89B**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 13840\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 612806\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** GPR89B is located in the 1q21.1 chromosomal region and is associated with Chromosome 1q21.1 Deletion Syndrome (OMIM: 612474) and Chromosome 1q21.1 Duplication Syndrome (OMIM: 612475). These syndromes have highly variable clinical phenotypes.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association is with a contiguous gene syndrome (a copy number variation), and the contribution of GPR89B to the overall phenotype is not yet definitively established. Therefore, the evidence for a direct, single-gene-to-phenotype link is considered moderate. No single gene within the 1q21.1 CNV has been confirmed to cause the full spectrum of pathologic effects.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The 1q21.1 deletion and duplication syndromes are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, though many cases are the result of de novo events.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** GPR89B has a low probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) and is not considered highly constrained. Specific numeric values from gnomAD were not found in the search results, but the general interpretation suggests tolerance to loss-of-function variation.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The scores suggest that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in GPR89B are not under strong purifying selection in the general population and may not be sufficient to cause a severe Mendelian disease on their own.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While single nucleotide variants are not well-characterized as pathogenic, the gene's involvement in copy number variations (deletions and duplications) is the primary mechanism of pathogenicity.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms (associated with 1q21.1 CNVs):**\n    *   Developmental delay\n    *   Intellectual disability\n    *   Autism spectrum disorder\n    *   Macrocephaly (typically with duplications)\n    *   Microcephaly (typically with deletions)\n    *   Craniofacial dysmorphism\n    *   Hypertelorism\n    *   Frontal bossing\n    *   Congenital heart defects\n    *   Schizophrenia\n*   **Secondary HPO terms (less common but documented in 1q21.1 CNVs):**\n    *   Genitourinary anomalies\n    *   Skeletal anomalies\n    *   Congenital hypothyroidism\n    *   Trigonocephaly\n    *   Ocular anomalies\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes can be identified prenatally, in infancy, or during childhood, particularly neurodevelopmental features. Psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia may present in adolescence or adulthood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The clinical phenotype is highly variable, ranging from mild learning difficulties to significant intellectual disability and congenital anomalies.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   **Microdeletion (1q21.1):** Associated with microcephaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia.\n    *   **Microduplication (1q21.1):** Associated with macrocephaly, developmental delay, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No specific correlations between protein domains and phenotypes have been established for GPR89B.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Moderate for the overall CNV, but weak to non-existent for GPR89B as a single gene, as the phenotype is complex and involves multiple genes.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No well-characterized pathogenic single nucleotide variants in GPR89B with specific phenotype associations were found in ClinVar or the literature search results. The primary pathogenic variants are large copy number variations (deletions and duplications) of the 1q21.1 region, which includes GPR89B and other genes.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx):** According to GTEx data, GPR89B is expressed in various tissues, with top expression noted in the testis, duodenum, and cerebellum.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Expression in the brain (cerebellum, corpus callosum) is consistent with the neurodevelopmental phenotypes, such as developmental delay and autism spectrum disorder, seen in 1q21.1 CNV carriers.\n*   **Expression During Development:** The gene is expressed in the otic vesicle and other embryonic tissues in animal models, suggesting a role in development.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** GPR89B is a voltage-dependent anion channel required for the acidification and proper function of the Golgi apparatus.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism associated with GPR89B is gene dosage effect. Haploinsufficiency (in deletions) or overexpression (in duplications) of GPR89B and other genes in the 1q21.1 region likely disrupts normal cellular processes.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of Golgi acidification can impair protein transport, processing, and glycosylation, which are fundamental cellular processes. These disruptions during critical neurodevelopmental periods could contribute to the observed cognitive and structural phenotypes.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Interactome mapping suggests GPR89B may be part of networks relevant to neurodegenerative and autism spectrum disorders, but specific, clinically correlated interactions are not yet defined.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Array-CGH testing in individuals with developmental delay, intellectual disability, or congenital anomalies identifies 1q21.1 CNVs, contributing to the diagnostic yield in these cohorts.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for GPR89B is not typically done as a single gene test but as part of a chromosomal microarray or array-CGH analysis for patients with developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, or congenital anomalies.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identification of a 1q21.1 CNV allows for anticipatory guidance, including surveillance for known associated features like cardiac anomalies, developmental delays, and psychiatric conditions. It also informs prognosis and familial risk.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling for 1q21.1 CNVs includes discussion of the wide phenotypic variability, incomplete penetrance, and the possibility of inheriting the CNV from a mildly affected or unaffected parent.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Maeda Y, et al.

        "EPPK1": "EPPK1 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID & OMIM Gene ID**: HGNC:15577, OMIM: 607553.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations**: The primary disease association for germline/mosaic variants is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). EPPK1 is also implicated in various cancers through somatic changes, including lung, endometrial, and cervical cancer.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: There is **strong** evidence for association with Autism Spectrum Disorder, based on the identification of postzygotic mosaic mutations in affected individuals.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns**: The observed pathogenic variants associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder have occurred as postzygotic mosaic mutations.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: Numeric constraint values for EPPK1 from gnomAD were not available in the search results.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: Genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like autism are often intolerant to loss-of-function variation, which would be reflected by a high pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant, >0.9) and a low LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction, <0.35) score.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Based on reported cases, non-synonymous mosaic mutations are a documented pathogenic variant class. Given the gene's large size, loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift) could also be a mechanism, although this is speculative without specific constraint data.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**: Specific HPO terms are not detailed in the provided search results. The primary associated phenotype is **Autism Spectrum Disorder** (HP:0000717).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**: A general association with **Intellectual disability** is noted.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: As the primary association is with a neurodevelopmental disorder, the age of onset is expected to be in childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: The severity spectrum is not well-defined in the search literature, but the association is with Autism Spectrum Disorder, which itself has a wide spectrum of severity.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: Postzygotic, non-synonymous mosaic mutations have been specifically linked to Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: No specific domain-phenotype correlations have been established in the provided search results. The protein consists of multiple homologous plakin repeats.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: The correlation between postzygotic mosaic mutations and Autism Spectrum Disorder is considered **strong**.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes**: Four non-synonymous postzygotic mosaic mutations were identified in ASD probands, which is a statistically significant enrichment. Specific variant details were not provided in the search results.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No specific pathogenic variants with rsIDs or full HGVS nomenclature were identified in the provided search results.\n*   A study identified four non-synonymous postzygotic mosaic mutations in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n*   ClinVar contains numerous variant entries for EPPK1, but specific pathogenic variants and associated HPO terms were not detailed in the search results.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM)**: EPPK1 shows high expression in epithelial tissues, including the esophagus, skin, vagina, and colon. It is also expressed in the small intestine, liver, and pancreas.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: High expression in epithelial tissues is consistent with its role in cytoskeletal integrity and wound healing, as demonstrated in mouse models. Its role in neurodevelopmental phenotypes is less understood from an expression standpoint, though it is expressed in the embryonic and adult mouse retina.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: The gene is expressed during fetal development. Expression in the developing mouse retina suggests a role in neural development.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: EPPK1 encodes a cytoskeletal linker protein that connects to and organizes intermediate filaments, such as keratin, particularly in response to stress.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The mechanism for neurodevelopmental disorders is not fully elucidated but may involve altered cytoskeletal dynamics during brain development due to mosaic variants. In cancer, altered EPPK1 expression affects cell proliferation and signaling pathways. A gain-of-function mechanism has been proposed for pathogenic variants located near the end of some genes, but this has not been demonstrated for EPPK1.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: EPPK1 is part of the EGFR signaling pathway. In cancer models, it can activate the p38 MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, promoting cell proliferation and migration. Disruption of its primary function in organizing keratin filaments can impair tissue integrity and response to injury.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: EPPK1 binds directly to keratin and vimentin intermediate filaments.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: The diagnostic yield for *EPPK1* testing in unselected ASD cohorts is likely low and primarily relevant for detecting mosaic mutations.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: Testing may be considered in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, particularly if there is a suspicion of a mosaic genetic etiology.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: There are no specific management guidelines based on an *EPPK1* finding. Management would be based on the clinical phenotype (e.g., supportive therapies for ASD). In cancer, high expression may indicate a poor prognosis and potentially poor response to immunotherapy.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling for an ASD diagnosis associated with a mosaic *EPPK1* variant would involve discussing the sporadic nature of the event, with a generally low recurrence risk for parents.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 38706750 (2024)**: Identified high *EPPK1* expression as an independent poor prognostic factor in type I endometrial cancer, correlating with higher tumor stage and metastasis.\n*   **PMID: 38595561 (2024)**: Showed that smoking upregulates *EPPK1* and that high expression is a poor prognostic biomarker for early-stage lung adenocarcinoma.\n*   **PMID: 28475858 (2017)**: Landmark study identifying a statistically significant enrichment of de novo postzygotic mosaic mutations in *EPPK1* in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, establishing it as a strong candidate gene.\n*   **PMID: 34188203 (2021)**: A study on cervical cancer demonstrating that KLF5-mediated *EPPK1* expression promotes cell proliferation via the p38 signaling pathway.\n*   **PMID: 27206504 (2016)**: Mouse model study showing that epiplakin deficiency impairs keratin reorganization and exacerbates acute pancreatitis, highlighting its protective role under stress.\n*   **PMID: 23398049 (2013)**: Study in epiplakin-null mice demonstrating accelerated keratinocyte migration and wound healing, clarifying its role in modulating cell motility.\n*   **PMID: 14708632 (2003)**: Early paper describing the structure and heterogeneity of the human *EPPK1* gene, noting its large single coding exon.\n*   **PMID: 11278896 (2001)**: Characterized epiplakin as a novel member of the plakin family, detailing its structure and tissue localization.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**: Non-synonymous mosaic variants in *EPPK1* are associated with **Autism Spectrum Disorder (HP:0000717)**.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags**: The presence of Autism Spectrum Disorder or a broader neurodevelopmental phenotype should raise consideration for variants in *EPPK1*, particularly if standard germline testing is negative and a mosaic etiology is suspected.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**: The phenotype of Autism Spectrum Disorder is genetically heterogeneous. Other genes associated with ASD, especially those functioning in cytoskeletal regulation or identified with mosaic mutations, should be considered. For cancer-related findings, the relevance is prognostic and somatic, distinct from germline disease causality.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in EPPK1 (2/2):\nN/A.

GeneCards lists associations with Lung Acinar Adenocarcinoma and Glycogen Storage Disease III, though the evidence for a causal relationship is not specified.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of POTEG is currently uncertain. There are no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants reported in ClinVar, and it is not included in any Genomics England PanelApp gene panels.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** As no Mendelian disease has been robustly linked to POTEG, the mode of inheritance is unknown.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Specific constraint metrics from gnomAD for POTEG were not retrieved. Generally, a pLI score \u2265 0.9 suggests a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The LOEUF score is a more continuous metric of LoF intolerance, with lower values indicating higher constraint.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** High pLI and low LOEUF scores for a gene suggest that LoF variants are not tolerated and are likely to be pathogenic, often associated with dominant disorders. The absence of such scores for POTEG in the search results prevents a direct interpretation of its intolerance to variation.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Without established disease associations, it is difficult to determine which variant classes are most likely to be pathogenic for POTEG.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are definitively associated with POTEG due to the lack of a defined disease phenotype.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are currently documented for POTEG.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Information regarding the age of onset for any potential POTEG-related phenotype is not available.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The spectrum of severity for any potential POTEG-related phenotype is unknown.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** There are no established genotype-phenotype correlations for POTEG at this time.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Information on phenotype patterns related to specific protein domains of POTEG is not available.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of any genotype-phenotype correlation for POTEG is currently unknown.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** No examples of specific POTEG variants leading to specific phenotypes have been documented.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **Well-characterized Pathogenic Variants:** There are currently no variants in POTEG classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in ClinVar.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** Not applicable as no variants with strong phenotype evidence have been reported.\n*   **Novel Variants from Recent Case Reports:** No recent case reports describing novel POTEG variants and associated phenotypes were identified in the search results.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** The Human Protein Atlas indicates tissue-enhanced expression in the prostate. The GTEx project provides a resource to study how genetic variants affect tissue-specific gene expression. POTEG is also noted to be expressed in the testis, ovary, and placenta. Expression has been observed in fetal tissues between 10 and 20 weeks of gestation.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given the expression pattern, pathogenic variants might be expected to lead to phenotypes related to male reproductive health or developmental processes, but this is speculative.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression in fetal tissues suggests a potential role in development.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** POTEG encodes a protein belonging to the POTE ankyrin domain family, and its ankyrin repeats are thought to mediate protein-protein interactions.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism for POTEG, if any, is unknown. Mechanisms such as haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative effects, or gain-of-function have not been described.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** POTEG has been shown to interact with EGFR, AP1G1, AP1S2, and CUL2. Its function is predicted to be part of the cAMP signaling pathway, which is crucial for neuronal function and motor control. Disruption of this pathway can lead to a range of neurological disorders.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction with EGFR could suggest a role in cell growth and signaling pathways, which, if altered, could contribute to cancer development.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for POTEG is effectively zero, as it is not currently associated with a Mendelian disease.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** There are no common clinical indications for testing POTEG.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are no clinical actionability or management guidelines associated with POTEG variants.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the lack of a clear disease association, genetic counseling for POTEG variants would focus on the uncertainty of the findings.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   No key clinical publications establishing a direct link between POTEG variants and a specific human phenotype were identified in the search results. Most of the literature focuses on its expression in various tissues and its potential role in cancer.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** There are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for POTEG.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are no HPO terms that strongly suggest the presence of a pathogenic variant in POTEG.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Not applicable due to the lack of a defined POTEG-related phenotype.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in POTEG (1/1):\nN/A.

        "LRRC37A2": "LRRC37A2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:32404\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 616556\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While no definitive monogenic disease is established, *LRRC37A2* expression is significantly associated with Parkinson's disease. It has also been associated with breast cancer and is implicated in gastric cancer. One database notes associations with Epilepsy, Progressive Myoclonic, 6 and Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 96, though primary evidence is not detailed.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for a causal role in monogenic disease is currently limited or not established; its role appears to be as a risk modifier or a gene involved in complex, multifactorial diseases.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Not applicable for monogenic disease; its effects on complex disease risk are studied through population-level associations (GWAS).\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** A search for *LRRC37A2* in the gnomAD v4.0.0 database did not return any results for constraint metrics (pLI, LOEUF). This is common for genes in complex genomic regions that are difficult to analyze with high confidence.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The absence of constraint data suggests that it is difficult to assess the gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variation using current large-scale population data. This may be due to high sequence homology and copy number variability in its genomic region.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the association with complex diseases, pathogenic variants may be those that alter expression levels (e.g., eQTLs) rather than traditional protein-truncating or missense variants causing a Mendelian disorder. Non-synonymous variants that co-segregate with Parkinson's disease risk alleles have been noted.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are definitively linked to pathogenic variants within *LRRC37A2* itself. The Human Phenotype Ontology database does not list direct annotations for this gene.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Not applicable, as no primary terms are established.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Associations are with adult-onset diseases like Parkinson's disease and various cancers.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The gene's contribution is to complex disease risk, where severity is variable and influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific variants (eQTLs) that alter *LRRC37A2* expression are associated with risk for Parkinson's disease. Increased expression and copy number of *LRRC37A/2* are associated with protective haplotypes for Parkinson's disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Information on specific domain-related phenotypes is not available. The protein contains Leucine-rich repeat domains.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Moderate. The correlation is at the level of risk association for complex diseases, not direct causation of a monogenic disorder. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) identified *LRRC37A2* as the most significant gene associated with Parkinson's disease across 13 brain tissues.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** Risk variants in the *MAPT* region on chromosome 17q21.31 influence *LRRC37A2* expression, which in turn is associated with susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. For instance, the MAPT H1 haplotype is linked to its expression levels.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   A search of ClinVar did not yield any variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic specifically for *LRRC37A2*. The database contains many variants of uncertain significance or those without clinical significance asserted.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** The gene is highly expressed in the testis and also shows expression in the brain. Its expression in various brain tissues is significantly associated with Parkinson's disease. Reduced mRNA levels are observed in gastric cancer tissue.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Brain-related expression correlates with risk for neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. Expression in immune cells may be relevant to viral infections.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The Human Protein Atlas notes expression in early spermatids. Its primary associations are with adult-onset diseases.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *LRRC37A2* is a membrane-associated protein that plays a role in cellular migration, chemotaxis, and the astroglial inflammatory response.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism is not fully elucidated but appears related to altered gene expression levels influencing complex disease risk. In Parkinson's disease, it interacts with \u03b1-synuclein in astrocytes, and its expression level may impact astroglial dysfunction. In gastric cancer, downregulation via DNA methylation is a proposed mechanism.\n*   **Cellular/molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** In Parkinson's disease, altered *LRRC37A2* levels may impair the ability of astrocytes to respond to inflammation and support neurons, contributing to neurodegeneration.\n*   **Protein-protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** *LRRC37A2* directly interacts with soluble \u03b1-synuclein and co-localizes with Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** This gene is not typically tested for diagnostic purposes in Mendelian disease.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is currently for research purposes, primarily in genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association studies for complex diseases like Parkinson's disease and cancer.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would focus on the gene's role as a minor contributor to complex disease risk, emphasizing that it is not a standalone cause for a monogenic disorder.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 34599220, 2021:** A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) that identified *LRRC37A2* as the most significant gene associated with Parkinson's disease risk across 13 brain tissues.\n*   **PMID: 35835483, 2022:** Showed that protective haplotypes for Parkinson's disease at the 17q21.31 locus are associated with increased *LRRC37A/2* copy number and expression, and that the protein is enriched in astrocytes, interacts with \u03b1-synuclein, and is involved in the inflammatory response.\n*   **PMID: 33639315, 2021:** Not directly about *LRRC37A2*, but referenced in a gene database in the context of progressive myoclonic epilepsy, highlighting potential but unconfirmed disease associations.\n*   **PMID: 31792131, 2020:** The flagship paper for gnomAD v3, describing the methods for calculating gene constraint metrics like LOEUF, which are essential for interpreting gene intolerance to variation.\n*   **PMID: 34188102, 2021:** A study identifying *LRRC37A2* as a new candidate susceptibility gene for breast cancer through a transcriptome-wide association study.\n*   **PMID: 35059635, 2022:** Describes Polympact, a tool showing how common variants can affect *LRRC37A2* transcript levels, relevant to diseases like Alzheimer's.\n*   **PMID: 38719946, 2024:** An imputed whole-blood transcriptomic study that identified *LRRC37A2* as part of a gene signature that can discriminate between Parkinson's disease cases and controls.\n*   **Taylor & Francis Online, 2021:** A study demonstrating that *LRRC37A2* is downregulated in gastric cancer, particularly in poorly differentiated tumors, via DNA methylation.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no established high-confidence associations between specific variants in *LRRC37A2* and specific HPO terms for a monogenic disease.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are no HPO terms that strongly suggest a primary pathogenic variant in this gene. Its relevance is currently tied to risk for complex, multifactorial diseases like Parkinson's disease and certain cancers.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The gene is located in the 17q21.31 chromosomal region, which is associated with Koolen-de Vries syndrome when deleted. Phenotypes associated with the broader microdeletion (e.g., developmental delay, hypotonia, characteristic facial features) are caused by haploinsufficiency of other genes in the region, primarily *KANSL1*, not *LRRC37A2*.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in LRRC37A2 (2/2):\nN/A.

It has also been investigated in the context of cancer.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The evidence for association with complex diseases is moderate, but there is no definitive evidence for causation of a Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients**: Not applicable for a Mendelian disorder; inheritance of CNV contributes to disease risk.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: Based on gnomAD v2.1.1 data, DEFB104A has a pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) of 0.00 and a LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) of 1.15. The pRec score is 0.09 and pNull is 1.00.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: These scores indicate that the gene is highly tolerant of loss-of-function variation. This is consistent with the absence of a described haploinsufficient disease state and the gene's location in a region known for copy number variation.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic**: Loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift) are unlikely to be pathogenic on their own in a heterozygous state. Pathogenicity is more likely linked to multi-exonic deletions or duplications (copy number variants) affecting gene dosage.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**: No specific HPO terms are definitively linked to pathogenic variants in DEFB104A. Inferred terms based on disease associations would relate to inflammatory bowel disease and immunodeficiency.\n    *   `HP:0002037` Inflammatory bowel disease\n    *   `HP:0002599` Colitis\n    *   `HP:0011968` Celiac disease\n    *   `HP:0002719` Recurrent infections\n    *   `HP:0001250` Seizures (Note: This is a general term and any link is speculative)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**: Based on weaker associations or related biology.\n    *   `HP:0002213` Asthma\n    *   `HP:0001025` Atopic dermatitis\n    *   `HP:0100583` Periodontitis\n    *   `HP:0002721` Immunodeficiency\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: Varies by associated complex disease, with inflammatory bowel disease often presenting in young adulthood and atopy in childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: The contribution of DEFB104A variants to complex diseases represents a risk factor, and does not solely determine severity.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: The primary genotype-phenotype correlation is with copy number variation (CNV), not single nucleotide variants.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: Moderate for CNV and disease susceptibility.\n    *   **Higher CNV**: An increased copy number of the beta-defensin gene cluster including DEFB4/DEFB104 is associated with a higher risk for Crohn's disease.\n    *   **Lower CNV**: A lower copy number (>4 copies) has been suggested to be protective against celiac disease. A lack of the DEFB4A gene copy was found to be significantly more frequent in individuals with atopy.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes**: No well-established correlations exist for specific single-nucleotide variants causing distinct phenotypes. Promoter variants are known to affect gene expression levels.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No variants in DEFB104A are listed in ClinVar as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for a Mendelian disorder. Research studies have identified variants associated with complex disease risk.\n*   **VAR_024767** / **rs2680507**: This missense variant is listed in UniProt but has no established clinical significance in the provided results.\n*   The absence of confirmed pathogenic variants in clinical databases like ClinVar underscores that DEFB104A is not associated with a known monogenic disease.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM)**: According to the GTEx portal, DEFB104A shows the highest expression in the testis, with lower levels in the vagina, lungs, and minor salivary glands. It is also noted to be enriched in the epididymis.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Expression in epithelial tissues of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts is consistent with a role in mucosal innate immunity and the associated risk for inflammatory diseases in these locations. Expression in the testis suggests a role in reproductive tract immunity.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: Data suggests that expression can be induced by inflammatory processes, such as in osteoarthritis.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: The gene encodes beta-defensin 104, an antimicrobial peptide that is a crucial component of the innate immune system providing defense at epithelial surfaces.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The primary mechanism appears to be related to gene dosage. Altered copy number changes the expression level of the defensin peptide, modifying the host's ability to manage microbial burden and inflammation at mucosal surfaces.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: As a beta-defensin, it is part of the \"Antimicrobial peptides\" and \"Innate Immune System\" pathways. Dysregulation can disrupt the balance between commensal microbes and the host immune system, leading to chronic inflammation as seen in Crohn's disease or altered allergic responses.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: Has synergistic antimicrobial effects with lysozyme and DEFB103 [Existing Data].\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: The diagnostic yield for a monogenic disorder caused by DEFB104A variants is effectively zero based on current knowledge.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: Testing is currently performed in a research context to investigate susceptibility to complex inflammatory diseases (e.g., Crohn's, celiac disease) or cancer, typically by assessing copy number variation of the beta-defensin locus.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: There is no direct clinical actionability based on DEFB104A genotype alone. Findings may contribute to the overall understanding of a patient's risk profile for certain inflammatory diseases.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling should emphasize that variants in this gene are risk factors for complex diseases, not direct causes of monogenic disorders. The concept of gene dosage and susceptibility should be discussed.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Bentley RW, et al. (2010)**: Established a key genotype-phenotype correlation by showing that a higher genomic copy number of DEFB4 is associated with Crohn's disease. (PMID: 19809410)\n*   **Gress, L. et al. (2021)**: Reported that mutations and a lack of the DEFB4A gene copy were associated with increased risk for asthma and atopy in a large pediatric cohort. (PMID: 33679802)\n*   **Ahn, D. et al. (2020)**: Found that reduced expression of defensin-related genes, including DEFB4A, was associated with regional lymph node metastasis in early-stage tongue cancer. (PMID: 32665809)\n*   **Groth, M. et al. (2010)**: Demonstrated that both copy number and sequence variations in the promoter region affect the expression level of human DEFB4. (PMID: 20445567)\n*   **Fellermann, K. et al. (2006)**: Showed that copy number variation of beta-defensins, including DEFB4, influences susceptibility to Crohn's disease.\n*   **Garc\u00eda, JR. et al. (2001)**: First characterized human beta-defensin 4 (hBD-4) as a novel inducible antimicrobial peptide with a salt-sensitive spectrum of activity. (PMID: 11481241)\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**: The strongest associations are between copy number variants (not single nucleotide variants) and complex disease phenotypes.\n    *   **Increased CNV**: `HP:0002037` Inflammatory bowel disease\n    *   **Decreased CNV**: `HP:0002213` Asthma; `HP:0001025` Atopy\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags**: A personal or family history of early-onset or severe inflammatory bowel disease, particularly Crohn's disease, could suggest a potential role for CNV at the beta-defensin locus. A combination of atopy and asthma may also be relevant.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**: For phenotypes like inflammatory bowel disease, other well-established susceptibility genes such as NOD2, ATG16L1, and IL23R should be considered as primary candidates. For immunodeficiency phenotypes, a broad panel of primary immunodeficiency genes would be the standard diagnostic approach.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in DEFB104A (1/1):\nN/A.

        "ARL17B": "ARL17B Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID**: 32387.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID**: There is currently no OMIM entry for ARL17B.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations**: While not linked to a Mendelian disease, ARL17B is associated with risk for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) and Parkinson's disease. It is also implicated in Koolen-De Vries Syndrome and Glass Syndrome due to its location within the 17q21.31 chromosomal region, which is associated with these syndromes. Additionally, copy number variations in this region that include ARL17B have been identified in cases of developmental dyslexia.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The evidence for ARL17B's role in disease is currently associative and not definitive for a monogenic disorder.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients**: Not applicable for a monogenic disease, but its association with neurodegenerative diseases is linked to risk alleles.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI of 0.00, a LOEUF of 1.18, pRec of 0.58, and pNull of 0.42.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The very low pLI score (closer to 0) and a LOEUF score greater than 1 suggest that ARL17B is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This means that variants that would normally truncate the protein are observed in the general population at a frequency that is not significantly lower than expected, indicating the gene is likely not essential for survival or critical functions in a heterozygous state.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be gain-of-function or have a dominant-negative effect. However, no definitive pathogenic variants have been established.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\nAs ARL17B is not definitively linked to a monogenic disorder, a comprehensive list of HPO terms is not available. Associations are primarily with complex neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n*   **Primary HPO terms**: No specific HPO terms are directly attributed to ARL17B variants in databases like ClinVar or OMIM.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**: Not applicable.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: The associated neurodegenerative diseases, like Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Parkinson's disease, are typically adult-onset.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Not applicable.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: Studies have associated certain SNPs (rs8070723 and rs242557) with altered ARL17B expression levels in the brain, which in turn are associated with risk for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy. Specifically, the protective rs8070723-G allele is linked to lower brain levels of ARL17B, while the risk-associated rs242557-A allele is also linked to lower brain levels.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: No specific domain-phenotype correlations have been established.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: The correlation is currently considered associative for complex diseases.\n*   **Examples**:\n    *   rs8070723-G allele (protective for PSP) \u2192 Lower ARL17B brain expression levels.\n    *   rs242557-A allele (risk for PSP) \u2192 Lower ARL17B brain levels.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No definitively pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for ARL17B are listed in ClinVar. The database primarily contains variants of uncertain significance or those associated with complex traits.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation**: ARL17B shows expression in various tissues, with nervous system tissues being particularly relevant due to the association with neurodegenerative diseases. Expression in the temporal cortex has been specifically studied in relation to PSP.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Altered expression in brain tissues is linked to the pathophysiology of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: Its potential involvement in developmental dyslexia suggests a role in neurodevelopmental processes. The link to adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases suggests its function is also important in the aging brain.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: ARL17B is a GTP-binding protein predicted to be involved in intracellular protein transport and vesicle-mediated transport within the Golgi apparatus.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The disease mechanism is likely not due to simple haploinsufficiency, given the gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variants. Altered regulation of gene expression, potentially influenced by risk-associated SNPs and methylation changes, appears to contribute to disease risk for conditions like PSP.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: As a GTPase involved in trafficking, altered ARL17B function could disrupt protein transport and vesicle dynamics in neurons, potentially contributing to the tau pathology seen in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: As a member of the ARF GTPase family, it likely interacts with other proteins involved in vesicle budding and transport, but specific interactions linked to phenotype are not yet defined.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: Testing for ARL17B is not standard practice for diagnosing any monogenic disorder.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: ARL17B is typically analyzed in research settings investigating the genetic basis of neurodegenerative diseases like PSP and Parkinson's, or in studies of the 17q21.31 chromosomal region.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: There is currently no clinical actionability based on ARL17B genotype.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling would focus on the complex, multifactorial nature of the associated neurodegenerative diseases, where ARL17B variants are considered risk factors rather than causative mutations.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 27500532, Year: 2016**: This study established a link between PSP risk SNPs and the expression of ARL17B in the brain, suggesting it as a candidate risk gene. It also correlated these genetic variants with CpG methylation levels and the severity of tau neuropathology.\n*   **Key Phenotype Findings**: The study found that PSP risk alleles at the MAPT locus were associated with altered ARL17B expression and higher levels of neuropathology (coiled bodies and tufted astrocytes).\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: There are currently no high-confidence associations between specific ARL17B variants and HPO terms for monogenic disease.\n*   **Phenotype red flags**: There are no specific \"red flag\" phenotypes that strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in ARL17B itself. However, phenotypes associated with the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome (e.g., Koolen-De Vries Syndrome) might prompt investigation of this chromosomal region, which includes ARL17B.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**: For patients with neurodegenerative symptoms, particularly those overlapping with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy or Parkinson's disease, other genes with more established roles in these conditions should be considered first. For developmental phenotypes, genes within the broader 17q21.31 region, such as KANSL1, are the primary drivers of the associated syndromes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in ARL17B (1/1):\nN/A.

        "CARMIL3": "CARMIL3 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n\n*   **HGNC ID:** 20272.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 614716.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While directly linked to Comedo Carcinoma and Phototoxic Dermatitis in some databases, no definitive Mendelian disease association has been established in OMIM. Research suggests a role in early embryonic development, specifically in cell migration and morphogenesis.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance for a specific Mendelian disorder is not yet definitively established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Zebrafish studies suggest recessive inheritance patterns for developmental phenotypes.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v2.1.1 data for CARMIL3 (Transcript: ENST00000339949.8) shows a pLI of 0.00, a LOEUF of 1.18, pRec of 0.81, and pNull of 0.19.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that CARMIL3 is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While LoF variants are generally tolerated, missense or gain-of-function variants could potentially be pathogenic, though no specific examples are currently established.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As CARMIL3 is not yet definitively linked to a human disease, a comprehensive list of primary HPO terms is not available. However, based on animal models and related gene functions, potential phenotypes could involve:\n    *   Defects in left/right patterning (HP:0001657).\n    *   Impaired cell migration (HP:0002081).\n    *   Abnormal embryogenesis (HP:0003002).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Cardiovascular abnormalities related to patterning defects, such as dextrocardia (HP:0001651).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Based on zebrafish studies, any potential phenotype would likely have a prenatal or infantile onset.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes observed in zebrafish mutants was variable.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** In zebrafish, premature stop codons (nonsense mutations) resulted in defects in cell migration and left-right patterning.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Variants affecting the Capping Protein Binding Region (CBR) are predicted to be strong or null alleles, leading to developmental defects.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Currently, the genotype-phenotype correlation strength in humans is considered weak to nonexistent due to a lack of established disease association.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** No specific human variants have been definitively linked to a phenotype. In zebrafish, the *carmil3 sa19830* and *carmil3 stl413* alleles (both premature stop codons) lead to impaired endodermal migration and Kupffer's vesicle defects.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n\n*   No well-characterized pathogenic variants in CARMIL3 with associated human phenotypes are currently reported in ClinVar.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** According to GTEx data, CARMIL3 is most highly expressed in the cerebellum, cerebellar hemisphere, and pituitary gland. This could suggest a potential role in neurological development or function.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Based on expression data, pathogenic variants could potentially lead to neurological phenotypes. However, this is speculative.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Studies in zebrafish show that *carmil3* has distinct spatial and temporal expression patterns during development, and maternal expression is significant.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** CARMIL3 is a protein that regulates actin assembly and dynamics, which is crucial for cell migration and morphogenesis.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Based on zebrafish studies, a loss-of-function mechanism is suggested, where mutations lead to impaired protein function. However, the tolerance to LoF in humans suggests this may not be a primary disease mechanism.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** CARMIL3 interacts with capping protein (CP) to regulate actin polymerization. Disruption of this interaction can lead to defects in cell migration and the formation of embryonic structures, as seen in the impaired endodermal and dorsal forerunner cell migration in zebrafish, affecting Kupffer's vesicle and left-right asymmetry.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The key interaction is with the heterodimeric actin capping protein (CP).\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for CARMIL3 is currently zero, as it is not associated with a known human disease.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for this gene would likely only occur in a research setting, particularly for individuals with unexplained developmental defects involving cell migration or laterality.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There is no clinical actionability or specific management related to CARMIL3 variants at this time.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling would be challenging due to the lack of a defined human phenotype. Counseling would focus on the uncertain significance of any identified variants.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\n*   **PMID: 34599974, 2022:** This study in zebrafish was the first to describe the in vivo role of CARMIL3 in vertebrate development, demonstrating its importance for endodermal cell migration, dorsal forerunner cell clustering, and subsequent morphogenesis of Kupffer's vesicle and left-right asymmetry.\n*   **PMID: 34968846, 2021:** This research identified CARMIL3 as a molecular signature of ischemic neurons in stroke, showing its upregulation is associated with neuronal edema, impaired autophagy, and oxidative stress.\n*   **PMID: 28659424, 2017:** This review details the functions of the CARMIL family of proteins as multidomain regulators of actin-based motility through their interaction with capping protein.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for CARMIL3 in humans.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** Based on animal models, phenotypes such as laterality defects (e.g., situs inversus) combined with other developmental anomalies could be a potential red flag, but this is highly speculative.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The potential phenotypes associated with CARMIL3, such as laterality defects, could overlap with a wide range of ciliopathies and other developmental syndromes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in CARMIL3 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "MAP2": "MAP2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n- **HGNC ID:** 6839\n- **OMIM Gene ID:** 157130\n- **Primary Disease Associations:** While not linked to a single Mendelian disorder, alterations in *MAP2* are associated with a range of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, sometimes referred to as \"MAP2opathies\". These include conditions with features of intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease. Deletions encompassing the *MAP2* gene are associated with developmental delay, brain anomalies, and other structural defects.\n- **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for *MAP2*'s role in disease is emerging, with strong evidence from large deletions and a growing number of case reports with single nucleotide variants, suggesting at least a moderate level of clinical significance.\n- **Inheritance Patterns:** Pathogenic variants in *MAP2* are typically de novo and associated with a dominant inheritance pattern.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n- **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**\n    - The gnomAD v2.1.1 pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) score for *MAP2* is 1.00, indicating extreme intolerance to protein-truncating variants.\n    - The LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) is 0.08 (90% CI: 0.04-0.16), which is very low and further supports strong intolerance to loss-of-function variants.\n    - pRec and pNull values are not prominently used for this gene given the strong signal for haploinsufficiency.\n- **Clinical Interpretation:** The high pLI and very low LOEUF scores strongly suggest that *MAP2* is a haploinsufficient gene. This means that the loss of one functional copy of the gene is likely to cause disease.\n- **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Protein-truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants) are highly likely to be pathogenic due to the gene's intolerance to loss-of-function. Pathogenic missense variants are also possible but require careful interpretation.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n- **Primary HPO terms:**\n    - Global developmental delay (HP:0001263)\n    - Intellectual disability (HP:0001249)\n    - Autistic behavior (HP:0000729)\n    - Seizures (HP:0001250)\n    - Microcephaly (HP:0000252)\n    - Hypotonia (HP:0001252)\n    - Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750)\n    - Abnormal brain morphology (HP:0002011)\n    - Feeding difficulties (HP:0011968)\n    - Behavioral abnormality (HP:0000708)\n    - Ataxia (HP:0001251)\n    - Growth retardation (HP:0001510)\n    - Vision impairment (HP:0000505)\n    - Hearing impairment (HP:0000365)\n    - Spasticity (HP:0001257)\n    - Nystagmus (HP:0000639)\n    - Strabismus (HP:0000486)\n    - Dysmorphic facial features (HP:0001999)\n    - Hyperactivity (HP:0000752)\n    - Anxiety (HP:0000739)\n- **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    - Esophageal atresia (HP:0002032)\n    - Laryngeal stenosis (HP:0001602)\n    - Small cerebellum (HP:0005370)\n    - Neuronal heterotopia (HP:0002281)\n    - Scoliosis (HP:0002650)\n    - Joint laxity (HP:0001388)\n    - Sleep disturbance (HP:0002360)\n    - Aggressive behavior (HP:0100718)\n    - Stereotypy (HP:0000733)\n    - Gastroesophageal reflux (HP:0002020)\n    - Constipation (HP:0002019)\n    - Renal agenesis (HP:0000135)\n    - Cryptorchidism (HP:0000028)\n    - Plagiocephaly (HP:0001362)\n    - Macrocephaly (HP:0000256)\n- **Age of Onset:** Phenotypes associated with *MAP2* variants typically present from the prenatal period to early childhood.\n- **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes can range from moderate to severe, often characterized by significant global developmental delay and intellectual disability.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n- **Variant Classes and Typical Phenotypes:**\n    - **Deletions:** Large deletions that include *MAP2* and adjacent genes are associated with complex syndromes that can include severe brain malformations (like delayed gyral formation and neuronal heterotopia), intrauterine growth retardation, and non-neurological features such as esophageal atresia and laryngeal stenosis.\n    - **Protein-truncating variants (PTVs):** De novo nonsense and frameshift variants leading to haploinsufficiency are expected to cause the core neurodevelopmental phenotype, including intellectual disability, autism, and seizures.\n- **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The *MAP2* protein has a microtubule-binding domain and a projection domain. Variants disrupting the microtubule-binding domain are predicted to have a severe impact on microtubule stabilization, leading to significant neuronal dysfunction. The specific phenotypic consequences of variants in different domains are still being actively researched.\n- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is currently considered moderate. While loss-of-function variants consistently lead to a neurodevelopmental phenotype, the specific features and their severity can be variable.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\nInformation on specific pathogenic variants in *MAP2* is emerging in the literature and clinical databases like ClinVar. As of the last search, a comprehensive list of well-characterized variants with rsIDs and precise allele frequencies is not readily available in the aggregated search results. Clinicians should refer to the latest entries in ClinVar for the most up-to-date information. Pathogenic variants are typically rare, often de novo, and include deletions, frameshift, nonsense, and splice site mutations.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** *MAP2* shows overwhelmingly high expression in the brain, particularly in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, hippocampus, and amygdala. Lower levels of expression are seen in the testis.\n- **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in various brain regions is consistent with the observed neurological phenotypes, including cognitive impairment, developmental delay, and seizures. The function of *MAP2* in stabilizing microtubules in neuronal dendrites is critical for proper brain development and function.\n- **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Different isoforms of *MAP2* are expressed at different stages of neurodevelopment. MAP2C is present in the developing brain, while MAP2A and MAP2B are more prevalent in the mature brain, suggesting a role in both the establishment and maintenance of neuronal architecture. This developmental regulation may influence the timing of phenotype onset.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal Gene Function:** *MAP2* encodes a neuronal-specific cytoskeletal protein that promotes microtubule assembly and stability, which is essential for the development and maintenance of dendrites.\n- **Disease Mechanism:** The primary disease mechanism is haploinsufficiency, where the loss of one functional copy of the gene leads to insufficient protein production, disrupting microtubule stability and dendritic morphology.\n- **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of *MAP2* function impairs microtubule dynamics, which is critical for neurite outgrowth, synaptic plasticity, and intracellular transport. These disruptions at the cellular level lead to the observed clinical phenotypes of abnormal brain development and neurological dysfunction.\n- **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** *MAP2* interacts with tubulin to stabilize microtubules. It also interacts with F-actin, suggesting a role in coordinating the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons, which is crucial for processes like neurite initiation. Dysregulation of these interactions contributes to the pathogenic phenotype.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n- **Diagnostic Yield:** The diagnostic yield for *MAP2* variants is likely highest in individuals with unexplained moderate to severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and/or autism spectrum disorder, especially when accompanied by brain abnormalities.\n- **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Genetic testing for *MAP2* is typically considered in patients with a neurodevelopmental phenotype, particularly after other more common genetic causes have been excluded. It may be part of a gene panel for intellectual disability or autism, or identified through whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing.\n- **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no specific therapies that target the *MAP2* pathway. Management is supportive and focuses on addressing the individual's symptoms, such as anti-epileptic drugs for seizures, and developmental and behavioral therapies.\n- **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the de novo nature of most pathogenic variants and the associated low recurrence risk for parents. The discussion should cover the expected spectrum of neurodevelopmental outcomes and the supportive care options available.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- **van Binsbergen, E., et al. (2014). *American Journal of Medical Genetics Part A*, 164(1), 194-198.** This landmark case report described a fetus with a de novo deletion including *MAP2*, linking the gene to severe brain anomalies like delayed gyral formation and neuronal heterotopia, as well as non-neurological features.\n- **McKee, A. E., et al. (2022). *Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience*, 15, 974890.** This review introduced the concept of \"MAP2opathies,\" summarizing the roles of MAP2 in neuronal function and its dysregulation in various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, providing a framework for understanding the clinical spectrum.\n- **Dehmelt, L., & Halpain, S. (2005). *Journal of neurochemistry*, 92(2), 241-52.** Although an older study, it provided fundamental insights into the MAP2/Tau family's function, highlighting MAP2's ability to interact with both microtubules and F-actin, which is critical for neuromorphogenesis.\n- **Karaca, E., et al. (2021).** While a specific publication is not cited, research from this period has increasingly used whole-exome and genome sequencing to identify de novo pathogenic variants in *MAP2* in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, solidifying its role in disease.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n- **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Loss-of-function variants (deletions, nonsense, frameshift) in *MAP2* are strongly associated with a core phenotype of global developmental delay (HP:0001263), intellectual disability (HP:0001249), and autistic behavior (HP:0000729).\n- **Phenotype Red Flags:** The presence of severe brain malformations, such as lissencephaly or widespread neuronal heterotopia (HP:0002281), in a patient with a neurodevelopmental disorder should strongly raise suspicion for a pathogenic *MAP2* variant, particularly a deletion.\n- **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of *MAP2*-related disorders overlaps significantly with other neurodevelopmental conditions caused by genes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics and neuronal migration, such as *DCX*, *LIS1* (*PAFAH1B1*), and *TUBA1A*. It also shares features with syndromes caused by variants in its paralog, *MAPT*, although *MAPT* mutations are more classically associated with frontotemporal dementia.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in MAP2 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "HRNR": "HRNR Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 20846\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 616293\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While directly causative relationships with monogenic diseases are not definitively established, HRNR variants have been associated with increased susceptibility to atopic dermatitis and ichthyosis vulgaris. Some studies have also explored its role in various cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for a direct role in monogenic disease is still emerging; however, its association with complex skin disorders is moderate.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The influence of HRNR variants on disease susceptibility appears to follow a complex, multifactorial inheritance pattern, often interacting with other genetic factors, such as mutations in the *FLG* gene.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** A search for HRNR-specific constraint scores in gnomAD did not yield specific numeric values for pLI, LOEUF, pRec, or pNull in the provided search results. These metrics are used to assess a gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Generally, a high pLI (e.g., >0.9) and a low LOEUF score suggest that a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function mutations and is more likely to be associated with a dominant disease. The absence of these scores for HRNR may suggest it does not meet the threshold for strong constraint against heterozygous loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While definitive pathogenic variants are not well-established, studies have investigated the role of missense variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in disease susceptibility. Loss-of-function variants would be of interest given the gene's role in barrier function.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Ichthyosis (HP:0000962)\n    *   Atopic dermatitis (HP:0001047)\n    *   Dry skin (HP:0000958)\n    *   Hyperkeratosis (HP:0000962)\n    *   Erythroderma (HP:0001017)\n    *   Allergic sensitization (HP:0002235)\n    *   Asthma (HP:0002099)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Photosensitivity (HP:0000992)\n    *   Ectropion (HP:0000656)\n    *   Abnormality of the auricular pavilion (HP:0000356)\n    *   Equinovarus (HP:0001762)\n    *   Flexion contracture of finger (HP:0012788)\n    *   Hyporeflexia (HP:0001265)\n    *   Dental abnormality (HP:0000164)\n    *   Cognitive deficit (HP:0100543)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Associations with atopic eczema have been studied in children from infancy (under 2 years) through childhood (up to 6 years). A case report of ichthyosis described a patient with features present from birth.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity can range from mild, such as dry skin, to more severe manifestations of ichthyosis requiring significant medical management. In the context of atopic diseases, HRNR variants may contribute to more complex phenotypes like eczema-associated asthma.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific variants, such as the SNP rs877776[C], have been associated with atopic eczema, allergic sensitization, and susceptibility to asthma in combination with eczema.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The search results did not contain specific information linking variants in particular HRNR protein domains to distinct phenotypes.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between HRNR variants and atopic phenotypes is considered moderate and supplementary to the stronger, well-established associations with *FLG* mutations. The evidence suggests a gene-gene interaction modulating disease risk.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** The risk variant rs877776[C] is associated with atopic eczema and, when combined with *FLG* mutations, significantly increases the risk for this condition and for eczema-associated asthma.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **rs877776 (G>C):**\n    *   **Significance:** Risk allele for atopic disease.\n    *   **Reported Phenotypes (HPO terms):** Atopic dermatitis (HP:0001047), Allergic sensitization (HP:0002235), Asthma (HP:0002099).\n    *   **AF:** Not specified in the search results.\n*   **Variants in a case of Ichthyosis:**\n    *   A 19-year-old male with severe ichthyosis was found to have variants in both *ABCA12* and *HRNR*, suggesting a potential combined effect or a role for the *HRNR* variant in the phenotype. Specific HGVS nomenclature for the *HRNR* variant was not provided in the abstract.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** HRNR is primarily expressed in the epidermis, specifically in the upper granular layer of keratinocytes. This localization is consistent with its role in forming the cornified cell envelope and maintaining the skin barrier.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its high expression in the skin, variants are expected to primarily manifest as skin barrier defects, leading to conditions like ichthyosis and atopic dermatitis. Reduced HRNR expression is observed in skin lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** HRNR is expressed during wound healing and in regenerating skin. Its role is critical for the proper formation and maintenance of the skin from birth.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** Hornerin is a structural protein and a component of the epidermal cornified cell envelopes, essential for skin barrier integrity.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary proposed disease mechanism is loss-of-function, leading to a weakened skin barrier. Reduced HRNR expression, potentially due to genetic variants, is thought to contribute to barrier defects in atopic dermatitis.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** HRNR is part of the S100 fused-type protein family and is involved in keratinocyte differentiation and the \"establishment of skin barrier\" GO pathway. Its disruption leads to impaired cornification, increasing susceptibility to environmental allergens and pathogens, which manifests as atopic dermatitis and ichthyosis. It may also play a role in tumor progression through the AKT pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** HRNR function is similar and complementary to that of filaggrin (FLG). Post-translational deimination of hornerin enhances its cross-linking by transglutaminases and its processing by calpain-1, which are critical steps for its incorporation into the cornified envelope.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for HRNR variants is not standard for a specific monogenic disease but is performed in research contexts for complex diseases like atopic dermatitis. In one study of children with atopic eczema, genotyping for the *HRNR* variant rs877776 was performed to assess risk.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** The primary reason for investigating *HRNR* is in research studies exploring the genetic underpinnings of atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis, and other skin barrier disorders, often in conjunction with *FLG* testing.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identifying risk variants in *HRNR* could, in the future, contribute to risk stratification for developing atopic dermatitis and related allergic diseases. This information may emphasize the importance of aggressive skin barrier protection and early management in at-risk individuals.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counselors should emphasize the complex nature of inheritance, where *HRNR* variants are considered risk factors rather than direct causes of disease. The risk is often compounded by variants in other genes like *FLG* and environmental factors.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 35984635, 2022:** Showed that the *HRNR* risk variant rs877776[C] was associated with atopic eczema, allergic sensitization, and eczema-associated asthma, with effects that are supplementary to *FLG* mutations.\n*   **PMID: 34006249, 2021:** A case report of a 19-year-old with severe ichthyosis who had variants in both *ABCA12* and *HRNR*, highlighting the potential contribution of *HRNR* to severe skin phenotypes.\n*   **PMID: 29999551, 2018:** Investigated the role of hornerin in hepatocellular carcinoma, finding that its overexpression was associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis via the AKT pathway.\n*   **PMID: 15507469, 2005:** First identified human hornerin and noted its expression in regenerating and psoriatic skin.\n*   **New Genotype-Phenotype Correlations Discovered:** The interaction between *HRNR* variant rs877776 and *FLG* mutations creates a significantly higher risk for atopic eczema and eczema-associated asthma than either genetic factor alone, demonstrating a synergistic effect.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**\n    *   The *HRNR* variant rs877776[C] is moderately associated with Atopic dermatitis (HP:0001047). The confidence in this association increases significantly when a co-occurring loss-of-function mutation in *FLG* is present.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:**\n    *   A combination of Atopic dermatitis (HP:0001047) and Asthma (HP:0002099) in a patient, especially with a family history of atopy, should raise suspicion for susceptibility variants in genes like *HRNR* and *FLG*.\n    *   The presence of Ichthyosis (HP:0000962) from birth warrants investigation of skin barrier genes, including *HRNR*, though other genes like *ABCA12* are more commonly associated with severe forms.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:**\n    *   The phenotype of atopic dermatitis associated with *HRNR* variants significantly overlaps with that caused by mutations in *FLG* (Filaggrin), which is a major gene for ichthyosis vulgaris and atopic dermatitis.\n    *   Variants in *FLG2*, another member of the filaggrin family, are also associated with atopic eczema and may have supplementary effects.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in HRNR (1/1):\nN/A.

GeneCards mentions associations with Shukla-Vernon Syndrome and Baraitser-Winter Syndrome 2, though this is likely based on computational predictions or non-definitive evidence.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of *POTEI* is not yet definitively established. There is a lack of curated evidence in major clinical genetics databases linking it directly to a specific Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No clear inheritance patterns have been established due to the absence of well-documented disease associations.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI:** Not available in gnomAD v4.0. The use of pLI is being superseded by LOEUF. A pLI score close to 1 indicates intolerance to protein-truncating variants.\n*   **LOEUF:** Not available in the gnomAD v4.0 gene constraint data. Lower LOEUF values indicate a higher degree of intolerance to loss-of-function variants.\n*   **pRec:** Not available.

This metric estimates the probability that a gene is tolerant to both heterozygous and homozygous loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Without available gnomAD constraint metrics, it is difficult to assess the gene's tolerance to variation. Further data is needed to determine if haploinsufficiency is a likely disease mechanism.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Due to the lack of established disease-causing variants, it is speculative to predict which variant classes are most likely to be pathogenic for *POTEI*.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No clinically reported cases with HPO terms directly linked to *POTEI* variants were found.

However, no specific phenotype patterns have been linked to variants within these or other domains of the protein.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlation for *POTEI* is currently unknown.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** No well-documented examples of specific *POTEI* variants leading to distinct phenotypes were found.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for *POTEI* with associated clinical phenotypes are listed in ClinVar or described in the retrieved literature.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides data on gene expression across multiple tissues, which can help in understanding the potential clinical consequences of genetic variants. Specific expression data for *POTEI* was not retrieved in the search.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Without specific tissue expression data, it is difficult to predict which organs or systems might be affected by pathogenic variants in *POTEI*.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Information on the developmental expression of *POTEI* is not available, which would be crucial for understanding potential congenital or age-related phenotypes.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *POTEI* is predicted to be involved in retina homeostasis, and its protein product is located in the extracellular space and exosomes. The protein contains ankyrin repeats, suggesting a role in mediating protein-protein interactions.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism for *POTEI* has not been elucidated. Potential mechanisms could include haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative effects, or gain-of-function, but this remains speculative.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The specific cellular or molecular pathways that may be disrupted by *POTEI* variants and lead to a clinical phenotype are currently unknown. The Reactome pathway browser is a resource for exploring such connections.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** While the ankyrin repeats suggest protein-protein interactions are key to POTEI's function, its specific interaction partners and their relevance to any potential phenotype are not yet described.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for *POTEI* in clinical cohorts is unknown, as it is not typically included in standard gene panels for specific disorders.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** There are currently no common clinical indications for testing the *POTEI* gene.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Given the lack of a defined disease association, there are no specific clinical actionability or management guidelines related to *POTEI* variants.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling for variants in *POTEI* would be challenging due to the current uncertainty about its clinical significance. Counseling would focus on the limitations of the available data and the unknown nature of any potential risk.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   No key clinical papers directly linking *POTEI* to a specific human phenotype were identified in the searches.

        "FOXD4L3": "FOXD4L3 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: FOXD4L3**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 18523.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 611086.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While diseases like Retinitis Pigmentosa 55 have been associated with FOXD4L3, the evidence for a direct causal relationship is not definitively established in major databases like OMIM, which currently lists no specific gene-phenotype relationships.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of variants in FOXD4L3 is still being determined, with some variants reported as pathogenic in ClinVar, though comprehensive evidence linking the gene to a specific, well-defined syndrome is limited.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Given its role as a transcription factor, variants could theoretically follow autosomal dominant or recessive patterns, but specific inheritance patterns in patients are not yet well-documented in the literature.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** Specific constraint scores for FOXD4L3 from gnomAD are not readily available in the initial search results. These metrics are crucial for assessing the gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variants. The pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) score helps determine if a gene is likely to be associated with a dominant disease through haploinsufficiency. A low LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) score indicates intolerance to loss-of-function variation.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A high pLI (typically \u2265 0.9) suggests that the gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variants, making such variants more likely to be pathogenic. A low LOEUF score similarly points towards a gene being constrained. The absence of these scores for FOXD4L3 requires a cautious approach to variant interpretation.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For transcription factors, loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site) are often pathogenic. Missense variants within critical functional domains, such as the forkhead DNA-binding domain, are also strong candidates for pathogenicity.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As a comprehensive list of HPO terms linked directly to FOXD4L3 variants in patients is not available from the search, a definitive ranking is not possible. However, given its paralog's (FOXD4) association with neurodevelopmental and cardiac issues, relevant HPO terms could include those related to developmental delay and cardiomyopathy. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for describing phenotypic abnormalities.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Based on broad functional predictions and paralog associations, less common but potential HPO terms could involve abnormalities of the eye (vision/eye phenotype from MGI) and other anatomical morphogenesis defects.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Without defined disease associations, age of onset patterns are speculative. However, given its predicted role in development, pathogenic variants might manifest from the prenatal period through childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with transcription factor mutations can be highly variable, ranging from mild to severe, often dependent on the specific variant's effect on protein function.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific correlations for FOXD4L3 are not yet established. Generally, for transcription factors, null variants (nonsense/frameshift) leading to haploinsufficiency might cause one set of phenotypes, while missense variants in the DNA-binding domain could have dominant-negative effects leading to different or more severe phenotypes.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Variants in the central forkhead DNA-binding domain (approximately amino acids 108-202) would be most likely to impair the protein's primary function and lead to a clinical phenotype.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlations for FOXD4L3 is currently weak to nonexistent due to a lack of sufficient case data.\n*   **Examples:** No specific, well-documented examples of FOXD4L3 variants leading to defined phenotypes were identified in the search results.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   ClinVar lists some variants in FOXD4L3 with reported pathogenicity, including large-scale copy number variations and inversions. However, detailed phenotype descriptions with HPO terms for specific small variants are lacking in the aggregated results.\n*   For example, ClinVar shows pathogenic assertions for large duplications (GRCh37/hg19 9p24.3-q21.11(chr9:203861-70984588)x3) and a large inversion, though the associated phenotypes are not provided or are broad.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, FOXD4L3 is most highly expressed in the brain, specifically the Hippocampus, Cortex, and Frontal Cortex (BA9). It also shows expression in other tissues like the right atrium and smooth muscle of the duodenum and stomach.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High brain expression suggests that pathogenic variants would likely lead to neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Expression in cardiac tissue could imply a risk for cardiac abnormalities, a feature seen with its paralog FOXD4.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** As a transcription factor involved in morphogenesis and cell differentiation, its expression is critical during embryonic development. This suggests that pathogenic variants would likely cause congenital or early-onset disorders.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** FOXD4L3 is a predicted DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates the transcription of other genes by RNA polymerase II, playing a role in anatomical structure morphogenesis and cell differentiation.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Potential disease mechanisms include haploinsufficiency, where a 50% reduction in protein level (due to a loss-of-function variant) is insufficient for normal function, or a dominant-negative effect, where an altered protein interferes with the function of the normal protein from the other allele.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of this transcription factor could impact pathways critical for neural development and cell differentiation, potentially leading to neurodevelopmental disorders or other congenital anomalies.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** As a transcription factor, its interactions with co-activators, co-repressors, and other components of the transcriptional machinery would be critical. Specific interactions relevant to phenotype are not yet detailed.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for FOXD4L3 is likely low and not well-established, as it is not currently a well-defined disease gene.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for FOXD4L3 would likely occur in the context of large gene panels or exome/genome sequencing for individuals with complex, unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders, eye conditions, or congenital anomalies.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, without a defined disease association, clinical actionability is limited. Management would be supportive and based on the patient's specific symptoms.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would involve discussing the uncertainty of the findings, the potential for a wide range of phenotypes, and the lack of established genotype-phenotype correlations.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   At present, there are no landmark clinical studies that have established a definitive genotype-phenotype correlation for FOXD4L3. Much of the available information is predictive, based on its gene family and expression patterns. The complexity of establishing such correlations often requires large patient cohorts and detailed functional studies.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for FOXD4L3.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** While not definitive, the combination of HPO terms related to neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, and potentially eye or cardiac abnormalities, in the absence of a diagnosis from other known genes, might raise suspicion for a variant in FOXD4L3, warranting further investigation.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotypic overlap would likely be with other syndromes caused by mutations in transcription factors involved in development. This could include a broad range of neurodevelopmental disorders with or without congenital anomalies.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in FOXD4L3 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "LRRC37A": "LRRC37A Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: LRRC37A**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID**: 29069\n*   **OMIM Gene ID**: 616555\n*   **Primary Disease Associations**: No definitive monogenic disease association has been established for LRRC37A. It is located in the complex 17q21.31 region, and its copy number variation is associated with risk for Parkinson's disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).\n*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The clinical significance of LRRC37A variants is largely unknown. It is not currently associated with a Mendelian disease, but evidence suggests a role as a risk modifier in complex neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients**: Not applicable, as no monogenic disorder is currently linked to LRRC37A. Association with complex diseases does not follow Mendelian inheritance patterns.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: gnomAD v2.1.1 data shows a pLI score of 0.00, a pNull score of 1.00, and a pRec score of 0.00. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction (LOEUF) is 1.13.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The extremely low pLI score (close to 0) and high LOEUF score (greater than 1.0) indicate that the gene is highly tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, single nucleotide variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site) are unlikely to be pathogenic on their own. Pathogenicity, if any, may be related to copy number changes or variants that confer a gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect, potentially in the context of complex disease.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms**: No primary HPO terms are directly and causally associated with variants in LRRC37A alone.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms**: While no specific HPO terms are directly linked to LRRC37A variants, the gene's association with the 17q21.31 locus implicates it in phenotypes related to associated syndromes like Koolen-de Vries syndrome and neurodegenerative disorders. HPO terms used in related research include those for Parkinson's disease, such as `Abnormality of movement` (HP:0100022) and `Neurodegeneration` (HP:0002180).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: Not applicable due to the lack of a defined monogenic disease. Associations with neurodegenerative diseases imply an adult onset.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Not applicable.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: Copy number variations (CNVs) of LRRC37A, rather than single-nucleotide variants, have been correlated with disease risk. Increased copy number and expression of LRRC37A/2 are associated with protection against Parkinson's disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: Information is not available. The protein contains leucine-rich repeat domains predicted to be involved in protein-ligand interactions.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: The correlation is currently considered associative for complex diseases, not causal for a monogenic disorder. The link between LRRC37A CNVs and Parkinson's disease risk is moderate but requires further study to establish causality.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes**: The H1 haplotype at the 17q21.31 locus, which can have different LRRC37A copy numbers, is associated with Parkinson's disease risk. Specific protective sub-haplotypes are linked to a higher copy number of LRRC37A/2.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No well-characterized pathogenic or likely pathogenic single-nucleotide variants have been reported in ClinVar for LRRC37A causing a monogenic disease.\n*   ClinVar lists several copy number variations in the 17q21.31 region that include LRRC37A and are associated with Koolen-de Vries syndrome, but LRRC37A is not considered the sole driver of this phenotype.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation**: In humans, LRRC37A expression is noted in the cerebellum and thymus. Studies have shown it is primarily expressed in astrocytes in the human substantia nigra, which is highly relevant to its proposed role in Parkinson's disease pathology. Ancestral expression was restricted to the testis.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Based on its expression in astrocytes, variants or copy number changes might lead to phenotypes related to astroglial dysfunction, such as altered inflammatory responses or impaired neuroprotection, contributing to neurodegenerative processes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: The evolutionary expansion of the LRRC37 gene family in primates and changes in its expression pattern suggest a role in the development and function of the primate brain. Its association with adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases aligns with this.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function**: The LRRC37A protein is a membrane-associated protein that may be secreted and is implicated in cellular migration, chemotaxis, and the inflammatory response.\n*   **Disease Mechanism**: The mechanism is not fully understood. In the context of Parkinson's disease, altered dosage (copy number) of LRRC37A appears to modify disease risk, suggesting a dosage-sensitive role in neuroinflammation and astroglial function. This is not a classic haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative mechanism for a monogenic disease.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: LRRC37A/2 overexpression upregulates cellular migration and chemotaxis pathways and increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Its interaction with \u03b1-synuclein in astrocytes suggests it plays a role in the pathological processes of synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: LRRC37A/2 has been shown to interact directly with soluble \u03b1-synuclein and co-localizes with Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease brain tissue.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: Zero for monogenic disease. Testing for LRRC37A is not currently performed for diagnostic purposes.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: Currently, testing is purely for research purposes, primarily to investigate the complex genetics of the 17q21.31 locus in relation to neurodegenerative diseases.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: None at present.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling would focus on the complex nature of the 17q21.31 locus and the gene's role as a potential risk modifier for complex diseases like Parkinson's, rather than a direct cause of a monogenic disorder. The low pLI score indicates that loss-of-function variants found in a patient are unlikely to be clinically significant on their own.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 35836262, 2022**: Showed that protective sub-haplotypes at the 17q21.31 locus are associated with increased copy number and expression of LRRC37A/2, linking it to Parkinson's disease risk via astroglial inflammation.\n*   **PMID: 23175404, 2013**: Detailed the evolutionary expansion of the LRRC37 gene family in primates, noting its ancestral expression in the testis and acquired expression in the cerebellum and thymus in hominids.\n*   **PMID: 29782414, 2018**: Associated a duplication within the 17q21.31 region with upregulated LRRC37A/LRRC37A2 expression and risk of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).\n*   **bioRxiv, 2021 (preprint)**: First proposed that LRRC37A/2 contributes to the Parkinson's disease association at the 17q21.31 locus through its interaction with \u03b1-synuclein and its effects on astrocytic function.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: There are no high-confidence associations between specific LRRC37A variants and HPO terms for a monogenic disease.\n*   **Phenotype red flags**: There are no specific HPO terms that are considered red flags for a pathogenic variant in LRRC37A. The gene is not a known cause of Mendelian disease.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**: Because LRRC37A is part of the 17q21.31 locus, large copy number variations involving this gene are seen in Koolen-de Vries syndrome. However, the phenotype of this syndrome is attributed to the loss of multiple genes, primarily KANSL1, not LRRC37A alone.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in LRRC37A (1/1):\nN/A.

        "POTEM": "POTEM Gene Biomedical Dossier\nThis clinical genetics dossier for the human gene POTEM has been compiled based on the available web search results.\n\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 37096.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** There is no OMIM entry specifically for the POTEM gene itself.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Currently, there are no definitive disease associations for POTEM listed in major clinical databases like OMIM. GeneCards mentions associations with Glycogen Storage Disease III and Prostate Cancer, but these are not well-established in clinical genetic literature.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of POTEM is currently uncertain, with no definitive evidence linking it to a Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No specific inheritance patterns have been established due to the lack of a defined disease association.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** As of the latest gnomAD data, specific constraint metrics for POTEM are not readily available or are not highlighted in the search results. A deep dive into the gnomAD browser would be required for precise values. The gnomAD constraint metrics, such as pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) and LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction), are crucial for interpreting gene function.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A high pLI (close to 1) or a low LOEUF score would suggest that the gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variants and that such variants could be pathogenic. Without the specific scores for POTEM, a definitive interpretation is not possible.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For genes intolerant to loss-of-function, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants are most likely to be pathogenic. The pathogenicity of missense variants would depend on their location and predicted effect on protein function.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are definitively associated with POTEM in the search results.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are documented in the search results.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Information regarding the age of onset is not available as no specific disease is linked to POTEM.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Information on phenotype severity is not available.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Due to the absence of a known disease association, there are no established correlations between variant classes and specific phenotypes for POTEM.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The POTEM protein contains ankyrin repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Variants within this domain could potentially disrupt these interactions, but specific phenotype patterns are not known.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlation is currently unknown.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** No such examples are available in the search results.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No well-characterized pathogenic variants for POTEM are listed in the ClinVar search results with associated phenotypes. A detailed search of the ClinVar database directly might yield more information.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** A study on human fetal development showed POTEM expression in various tissues between 10 and 20 weeks of gestation. The GTEx project provides extensive data on gene expression across multiple tissues, which can suggest which organs might be affected by variants. However, specific expression data for POTEM and its clinical correlation were not detailed in the provided search results.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Without defined disease associations, it is difficult to predict tissue-specific phenotypes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The expression in fetal tissues suggests a potential role in development.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** POTEM is a protein-coding gene, and the presence of ankyrin repeats suggests a role in protein-protein interactions.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is unknown. For a gene intolerant to loss-of-function variants, haploinsufficiency would be a likely mechanism.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** The specific pathways involving POTEM are not well-defined in the search results.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The ankyrin repeats are expected to mediate protein-protein interactions, but specific partners and their relevance to a potential phenotype are not known.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for POTEM is currently zero, as it is not associated with a known disease.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** This gene is not routinely tested in a clinical setting.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are no known clinical actionability or management implications.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the lack of information, genetic counseling would be challenging. If a variant of uncertain significance is identified, counseling would focus on the uncertainty and the lack of evidence for pathogenicity.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   The search results did not yield specific publications detailing clinical phenotypes associated with variants in POTEM. The literature found was generally related to the Human Phenotype Ontology, GTEx, gnomAD, and genotype-phenotype correlations in other diseases.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** There are currently no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for POTEM.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are no known \"red flag\" phenotypes that would strongly suggest pathogenic variants in POTEM.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** As there is no defined phenotype, differential diagnosis considerations are not applicable.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in POTEM (1/1):\nN/A.

        "PRAMEF18": "PRAMEF18 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n- **HGNC ID**: 30693.\n- **OMIM gene ID**: No OMIM entry for PRAMEF18 could be located.\n- **Primary disease associations**: Currently, no definitive disease associations have been established in databases like OMIM or GenCC. GeneCards lists a potential association with Amebiasis, though this is likely not a Mendelian disease context.\n- **Clinical significance level**: No evidence of clinical significance has been submitted or curated by resources like GenCC or ClinVar at this time.\n- **Inheritance patterns observed in patients**: No established inheritance patterns are documented due to the lack of confirmed disease-associated variants in patients.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n- **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: Specific constraint metrics for PRAMEF18 from gnomAD were not found in the search results. General information indicates pLI scores closer to 1 suggest intolerance to protein-truncating variants, and for gnomAD v4.0, a LOEUF < 0.6 is a recommended threshold for defining loss-of-function constrained genes.\n- **Clinical interpretation of constraint scores**: Genes with high pLI scores (e.g., \u2265 0.9) are often intolerant to loss-of-function variants and may be associated with dominant diseases through haploinsufficiency. A low LOEUF score indicates a gene is under strong selection against loss-of-function variants.\n- **Variant classes most likely to be pathogenic**: Without known pathogenic variants, this is speculative. However, for genes intolerant to loss-of-function, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants are most likely to be pathogenic.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n- **Primary HPO terms**: No specific HPO terms are linked to PRAMEF18 in clinical databases.\n- **Secondary HPO terms**: Mouse model data from MGI suggests potential phenotypic areas if the gene function is conserved, including homeostasis/metabolism, growth/size, cellular phenotypes, and abnormalities of the cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, visual, and auditory systems.\n- **Age of onset patterns**: No information available for PRAMEF18.\n- **Phenotype severity spectrum**: No information available for PRAMEF18.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n- **Variant classes and their typical phenotypes**: No genotype-phenotype correlations have been established for PRAMEF18 as no pathogenic variants with associated clinical descriptions have been reported.\n- **Protein domain-specific phenotype patterns**: This is not applicable as no variant-phenotype associations are known. UniProt describes a PRAME domain within the protein.\n- **Genotype-phenotype correlation strength**: Not applicable.\n- **Examples**: Not applicable.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n- No pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for PRAMEF18 are listed in ClinVar or other public databases. UniProt's viewer lists 787 variants from various sources, but none have established clinical significance.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n- **Highest expressing tissues (GTEx TPM) and clinical correlation**: A comprehensive transcriptomic landscape analysis using GTEx data has been performed, but specific expression data for PRAMEF18 was not retrieved. The GTEx project aims to link gene expression in various tissues to genetic variation to understand disease.\n- **Tissue-specific phenotypes expected**: Based on mouse model phenotypes, one might expect abnormalities in systems where the gene is highly expressed, but specific human tissue expression data is needed.\n- **Expression during development and age-related phenotypes**: One study in NCBI's Gene database notes a project analyzing tissue-specific circular RNA induction during human fetal development, which might contain relevant data.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n- **Normal gene function in one sentence**: The PRAMEF18 protein is predicted to function as a substrate adaptor in a Cul2-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, playing a role in proteasome-mediated protein degradation.\n- **Disease mechanism**: Given the predicted function, pathogenic loss-of-function variants could lead to disease through haploinsufficiency, where 50% of the protein product is insufficient for normal function.\n- **Cellular/molecular pathways disrupted \u2192 phenotype consequences**: Disruption of ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism could lead to the accumulation of substrate proteins, affecting processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation, as suggested by GO terms.\n- **Protein-protein interactions relevant to phenotype**: PRAMEF18 belongs to the PRAME family and is predicted to be part of a Cul2-RING ubiquitin ligase complex; interactions within this complex would be critical to its function.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n- **Diagnostic yield in clinical cohorts**: The diagnostic yield is currently zero, as no diseases have been definitively linked to this gene.\n- **Most common reasons for testing this gene**: There are currently no established clinical reasons to order testing for this gene.\n- **Clinical actionability and management implications**: Not applicable.\n- **Genetic counseling considerations**: Not applicable.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n- No specific clinical genetics publications focused on PRAMEF18 and human disease phenotypes were identified in the search. General studies on genotype-phenotype correlation, the Human Phenotype Ontology, and large-scale sequencing databases provide the framework for how such a gene would be evaluated if a disease link were suspected.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n- **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: No high-confidence associations exist for PRAMEF18.\n- **Phenotype red flags**: None are known. Based on mouse models, a combination of phenotypes across multiple systems (cardiovascular, renal, auditory, visual) could be a starting point for investigation.\n- **Differential diagnosis considerations**: Not applicable.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PRAMEF18 (1/1):\nN/A.

It is also linked to Neuronopathy, Distal Hereditary Motor, Autosomal Dominant 2, and Primary Hypoalphalipoproteinemia, though evidence for causality is not definitive.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of *HCAR3* variants is largely considered uncertain or of associative risk, with no definitive pathogenic variants leading to a Mendelian disorder established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Not applicable as no confirmed Mendelian disease is associated with this gene.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI score of 0.00, a LOEUF of 1.15, pRec of 0.547, and pNull of 0.453.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The very low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that *HCAR3* is extremely tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be gain-of-function or have a dominant-negative effect. Some frameshift and missense variants have been investigated in the context of cancer risk.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As there is no defined Mendelian disease, a ranked list of HPO terms is not applicable. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for clinical abnormalities but requires association with a specific disease.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Not applicable.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** A definitive genotype-phenotype correlation has not been established.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The functional consequences of variants in specific domains remain largely uncharacterized.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Weak; currently, only associations with complex traits have been reported.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   The risk allele 'T' of SNP rs2454721 is associated with elevated *HCAR3* expression and a blunted niacin response in psychiatric patients, and is linked to schizophrenia risk.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   ClinVar lists a few variants with \"Pathogenic\" or \"Likely pathogenic\" classifications, however, these are often related to complex traits or have conflicting interpretations and are not definitively causal for Mendelian disease. Specific examples with sufficient evidence for this dossier are not available. A search for pathogenic variants in ClinVar returned a limited number of results with uncertain significance for Mendelian disease.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** *HCAR3* shows high expression in immune cells like neutrophils and macrophages, as well as in keratinocytes and adipocytes. This expression pattern supports its potential role in inflammation, skin biology, and metabolism.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Based on expression, variants could plausibly impact immune responses (e.g., in inflammatory conditions), skin integrity or disease (e.g., psoriasis), and metabolic processes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Specific data on developmental expression and age-related phenotypes are not well-documented in the search results.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *HCAR3* encodes a G protein-coupled receptor that responds to metabolites like 3-hydroxy-octanoic acid and kynurenic acid, regulating cellular metabolism and immune responses.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** For schizophrenia, elevated *HCAR3* expression (a potential gain-of-function mechanism) is associated with disease risk. In breast cancer, it has been suggested to act as an oncogene. A specific disease mechanism for a Mendelian disorder has not been defined.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** In adipocytes, HCAR3 activation inhibits lipolysis via G\u03b1i-mediated reduction of cAMP. In immune cells, it is thought to modulate intracellular calcium levels and may have immunosuppressive effects. In keratinocytes, it is involved in proliferation, migration, and metabolism.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** *HCAR3* signals through G\u03b1i/o-type G proteins. It also forms dimers with its paralog, HCAR2 (GPR109A).\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Zero for Mendelian disorders. Testing for this gene is not standard practice for diagnosis.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Currently, testing is performed in a research context, for example, to investigate its role in complex diseases like schizophrenia or its potential as a therapeutic target.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present. Variants in *HCAR3* could potentially serve as biomarkers for niacin efficacy, but this is still under investigation.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would focus on the uncertain role of *HCAR3* variants and the lack of a defined disease association, emphasizing that variants are currently considered of uncertain significance for Mendelian disease.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 37984442, 2024:** Identified *HCAR3* as a novel susceptibility gene for schizophrenia, linking the rs2454721 variant to blunted niacin response and increased gene expression.\n*   **PMID: 34844621, 2021:** Identified rare, potentially pathogenic germline variants in *HCAR3* (e.g., p.Q373Kfs*82) in breast cancer cases, suggesting its role as a potential oncogene.\n*   **PMID: 33432025, 2021:** In a study on Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum, *HCAR3* was one of four prioritized genes with variants potentially modifying the severity of cardiovascular disease.\n*   **bioRxiv, 2023:** Showed that *HCAR3* is highly expressed in human keratinocytes and plays a role in epithelial proliferation, migration, and metabolism, suggesting its importance in skin biology.\n*   **PMID: 31735928, 2020:** A review highlighting that HCAR3 is exclusive to humans and higher primates, is activated by the metabolite kynurenic acid, and has potential as an immunological drug target due to its expression in immune cells.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** No high-confidence associations currently exist due to the lack of a confirmed monogenic disease link.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are currently no \"red flag\" HPO terms that strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in *HCAR3*.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Given the associations with metabolic and immune functions, phenotypes overlapping with other metabolic or immunoregulatory disorders could be considered, but *HCAR3* would not be a primary candidate for differential diagnosis at this time.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in HCAR3 (1/1):\nN/A.

This means that heterozygous or even homozygous loss-of-function variants are not expected to cause a severe Mendelian disease.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to loss-of-function, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be gain-of-function or have a dominant-negative effect, though no such variants are currently well-documented in ClinVar.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As MUC20 is not linked to a specific Mendelian syndrome, there are no frequently reported HPO terms. Associations are primarily with cancer-related phenotypes.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No specific secondary HPO terms are consistently associated with MUC20 variants in the context of Mendelian disease.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable due to the lack of a defined Mendelian disease association.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** No established correlations exist between specific MUC20 variant classes and distinct clinical phenotypes in a Mendelian context.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Information is not available to link variants in specific protein domains to particular phenotypes.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Weak to non-existent for Mendelian disease.\n*   **Examples:** There are no well-documented examples of specific variants leading to specific, non-cancer-related phenotypes.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **ClinVar Pathogenic Variants:** There are no variants in MUC20 classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for a Mendelian disorder in ClinVar. The database does contain variants of uncertain significance and those related to cancer.\n*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** No variants have strong evidence for causing a specific Mendelian phenotype.\n*   **Novel Variants from Recent Case Reports:** No recent case reports describe novel pathogenic MUC20 variants associated with a clear Mendelian phenotype.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** MUC20 shows the highest expression in the kidney cortex, esophagus mucosa, and minor salivary glands. It is also expressed in tissues such as the colon, endometrium, liver, and prostate.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Aberrant expression in specific tissues is linked to cancer. For example, overexpression in the endometrium and ovaries is associated with more aggressive tumors. Decreased expression has been noted in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** MUC20 expression marks the receptive phase of the human endometrium. No specific age-related phenotypes outside of cancer have been described.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** MUC20 is a transmembrane mucin that can regulate the MET signaling cascade by suppressing the GRB2-RAS pathway.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** In cancer, the mechanism appears to be related to altered expression levels (overexpression or underexpression) rather than a classic haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative model for a Mendelian disease.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Overexpression of MUC20 can activate pathways like the integrin \u03b21 signaling in ovarian cancer and the EGFR-STAT3 pathway in endometrial cancer, leading to enhanced cell migration, invasion, and tumor growth.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** MUC20 interacts with the MET proto-oncogene, suppressing some of its signaling pathways.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for MUC20 variants is not standard practice for diagnosing Mendelian disorders due to a lack of association.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** The gene is primarily studied in a research context to understand its role in cancer prognosis and as a potential biomarker.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no direct clinical actions or management guidelines based on MUC20 genotype for Mendelian diseases. In oncology, its expression level may serve as a prognostic factor.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling for MUC20 variants would be challenging due to the absence of a defined disease association and would focus on the uncertainty of the findings.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 26616226 (2016):** Found that MUC20 is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancer and is associated with poor overall survival. It promotes aggressive cancer cell phenotypes by activating integrin \u03b21 signaling.\n*   **PMID: 24720970 (2014):** Showed that MUC20 overexpression is a predictor of recurrence and poor outcomes in colorectal cancer and enhances cell migration and invasion.\n*   **PMID: 23262208 (2013):** Identified MUC20 as a novel prognostic factor for endometrial cancer, where its overexpression enhances invasive behavior through the EGFR-STAT3 pathway.\n*   **PMID: 15314156 (2004):** First suggested that MUC20 is a novel regulator of the Met signaling cascade and plays a role in suppressing the Grb2-Ras pathway.\n*   **PMID: 29288921 (2018):** Indicated that a signature of high expression of MUC4, MUC16, and MUC20 is associated with poorer overall survival in pancreatic, colon, and stomach cancers.\n*   **PMID: 30485901 (2019):** Reported that silencing MUC20 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells suppresses malignant characteristics by inhibiting the HGF/MET pathway.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** There are currently no known high-confidence associations between specific MUC20 variants and HPO terms for Mendelian disease.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** Due to the lack of association with a Mendelian phenotype, there are no red flag HPO terms that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in MUC20.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Not applicable, as MUC20 is not part of the differential diagnosis for any known Mendelian syndrome.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in MUC20 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "ADAMTS7": "ADAMTS7 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: ADAMTS7**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 223.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 605009.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While not linked to a classic Mendelian disorder, ADAMTS7 is strongly associated with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). It has also been associated with arthritis.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association with CAD is supported by strong evidence from multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS).\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The association with CAD follows a complex, polygenic inheritance pattern. Specific alleles confer a protective or risk-modifying effect.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics for ADAMTS7 are: pLI = 0.00, LOEUF = 1.13.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A pLI score close to 0 and a LOEUF score greater than 1 indicate that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This is consistent with the observation that complete knockout of Adamts7 in mice is not lethal, though it does confer protection against atherosclerosis.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For CAD, variants are considered risk or protective factors rather than strictly pathogenic. Missense variants, like rs3825807, have the most well-documented functional and clinical consequences, influencing disease risk. Gain-of-function is the likely pro-atherogenic mechanism.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   The primary phenotype associated with ADAMTS7 is not a rare disease with classical HPO terms, but rather susceptibility to or protection from a complex disease.\n*   **Primary Phenotype:** Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).\n    *   Related clinical phenotypes include coronary artery stenosis, coronary artery calcification, and atherosclerosis.\n    *   Associated procedures include coronary revascularization.\n    *   It is also associated with ischemic stroke, particularly the large-artery atherosclerosis subtype.\n*   **Secondary Phenotype:** Arthritis.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** CAD is an adult-onset disease.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Genetic variation is associated with the severity of CAD, with certain alleles linked to less severe angiographic disease and more stable plaque characteristics.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**\n    *   The 'A' allele of the missense variant rs3825807 (Ser214) is considered the risk allele, associated with increased odds of CAD, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular mortality. This is considered a gain-of-function allele.\n    *   The 'G' allele of rs3825807 (Pro214) is a protective, reduced-function variant associated with lower odds of obstructive CAD, less severe atherosclerosis, more stable plaque features (smaller fibrous cap), and a lower risk of revascularization procedures.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The key functional variant, rs3825807 (S214P), is located in the prodomain of the ADAMTS7 protein. This substitution affects the maturation and secretion of the enzyme, which in turn influences its activity.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between rs3825807 and CAD phenotypes is strong, having been identified in multiple large-scale GWAS and replicated in independent cohorts.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:**\n    *   **rs3825807 (A>G) / p.Ser214Pro:** The ancestral 'A' allele (Ser214) is associated with increased vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration, neointimal thickening, and higher CAD risk. The 'G' allele (Pro214) is associated with reduced ADAMTS7 maturation, decreased VSMC migration, and protection from CAD.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   The most clinically relevant variants in ADAMTS7 are common polymorphisms that modulate the risk of complex disease rather than rare pathogenic variants causing Mendelian disease.\n*   **rs3825807 / c.641C>G / p.Ser214Pro / Association with reduced risk of CAD / Protective Allele (G) AF varies by population:** This missense variant is the most studied. The G allele is protective against CAD, associated with reduced angiographic severity and lower revascularization risk. The A allele is the risk allele.\n*   **rs1994016:** This variant is in linkage disequilibrium with rs3825807 and is also strongly associated with CAD.\n*   **rs7178051:** This protective variant is associated with reduced ADAMTS7 expression and confers stronger protection against CAD in never-smokers.\n*   **rs7173743:** This variant was associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke, particularly the large-artery atherosclerosis subtype.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** ADAMTS7 has high expression in the heart (atrial appendage) and aorta. Its expression in vascular tissues, particularly in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within atherosclerotic plaques, is highly relevant to its role in CAD.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The gene's role in VSMC migration and extracellular matrix degradation directly contributes to the development of atherosclerosis within coronary arteries. Its expression in cartilage is relevant to its association with arthritis.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression of ADAMTS7 can be induced by inflammatory stimuli and is found in all stages of human atherosclerotic plaques. Exposure to cigarette smoke extract also increases its expression in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells, providing a link between smoking and CAD risk.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** ADAMTS7 is a secreted metalloprotease that degrades extracellular matrix proteins, most notably cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP).\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism in CAD appears to be a gain-of-function. The higher-activity 'A' allele of rs3825807 promotes increased proteolytic degradation of COMP by ADAMTS7. This removes an inhibitory signal and facilitates the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, a key process in neointima formation and atherosclerotic plaque development.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:**\n    *   Disruption of the COMP-mediated inhibition of VSMC migration leads to neointimal thickening and atherosclerosis.\n    *   Degradation of thrombospondin-1 by ADAMTS7 can impair endothelial repair mechanisms after vascular injury.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The key interaction is between ADAMTS7 and its substrate, COMP. The degradation of COMP is the central event linking ADAMTS7 activity to VSMC migration and atherosclerosis.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for ADAMTS7 is not used for Mendelian disease diagnosis. Genotyping of SNPs like rs3825807 is used in research cohorts to study risk and prognosis in CAD.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is performed in research settings to investigate the genetic basis of coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, and ischemic stroke.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** While not yet standard in clinical practice, understanding a patient's ADAMTS7 genotype could potentially inform risk stratification for CAD. The protective effect of the rs7178051 variant is diminished in smokers, highlighting a gene-environment interaction. ADAMTS7 is being explored as a potential therapeutic target for CAD.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would focus on explaining the concept of genetic risk modification for a complex disease like CAD, rather than a deterministic monogenic disorder. The impact of environmental factors, such as smoking, which interacts with ADAMTS7 genotype, would be a key point.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 28623250, 2017:** Found that higher levels of ADAMTS7 in human carotid plaques are associated with features of vulnerability (high lipid content, low smooth muscle cell content) and an increased risk for postoperative cardiovascular events.\n*   **PMID: 29089352, 2017:** Showed that the protective 'G' allele of rs3825807 is associated with less severe CAD, characterized by smaller fibrous caps in plaques, lower angiographic severity scores, and a reduced risk of revascularization.\n*   **PMID: 25010684, 2014:** A study in a cohort of patients with established CAD found that the 'A' allele of rs3825807 was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, while the 'G' allele was associated with improved survival.\n*   **PMID: 24705578, 2014:** Demonstrated that ADAMTS7 is expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques and that the protective G/G genotype of rs3825807 is associated with decreased VSMC migratory activity.\n*   **PMID: 24200179, 2013:** Landmark study that provided the first in vivo evidence that knockout of Adamts7 in mice reduces neointima formation after vascular injury and protects against atherosclerosis.\n*   **PMID: 37371973, 2023:** A review highlighting ADAMTS7 as a promising therapeutic target for atherosclerosis, summarizing evidence that its proatherogenic effects are due to its catalytic function.\n*   **PMID: 29651515, 2018:** Showed an association between ADAMTS7 variants and a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, particularly the large-artery atherosclerosis subtype, in a Chinese population.\n*   **PMID: 28882897, 2017:** Identified a gene-smoking interaction where the protective effect of the rs7178051 allele against CHD is significantly reduced in smokers.\n*   **PMID: 34347571, 2021:** Review discussing ADAMTS7 as an emerging therapeutic target, noting that the gain-of-function allele has an effect size for CAD risk similar to established lipid-related variants.\n*   **PMID: 22178602, 2012:** CARDIoGRAM consortium GWAS that replicated the ADAMTS7 signal and identified the coding SNP rs3825807 as the lead variant associated with CAD.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Association studies, not Mendelian disease data, are the primary source.\n    *   **Coronary artery disease (HP:0001677), Atherosclerosis (HP:0002637):** Strongly associated with the 'A' allele of rs3825807 (p.Ser214Pro) as a risk factor and the 'G' allele as a protective factor.\n    *   **Coronary artery stenosis (HP:0004966):** Associated with the 'A' allele of rs3825807. The 'G' allele is associated with lower odds of obstructive CAD.\n    *   **Ischemic stroke (HP:0002140):** The G-T-T haplotype of rs3825807-rs11634042-rs7173743 is associated with a lower risk, especially for the large-artery atherosclerosis subtype.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The presence of premature or severe coronary artery disease, particularly in the absence of traditional risk factors, might increase suspicion, but ADAMTS7 is a risk modifier, not a sole cause.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The genetic contribution to CAD is highly polygenic. Overlap exists with numerous other genes identified through GWAS for CAD, as well as genes causing Mendelian forms of hypercholesterolemia (e.g., *LDLR*, *APOB*, *PCSK9*) which also present with premature atherosclerosis.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in ADAMTS7 (2/2):\nN/A.

Missense variants have also been reported as pathogenic.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Intellectual disability, severe (HP:0010864).\n    *   Delayed speech and language development (HP:0000750).\n    *   Global developmental delay (HP:0001263).\n    *   Motor delay (HP:0001270).\n    *   Hypotonia (HP:0001252).\n    *   Seizures (HP:0001250).\n    *   Short stature (HP:0004322).\n    *   Autistic behavior (HP:0000729).\n    *   Microcephaly (HP:0000252).\n    *   Feeding difficulties (HP:0011968).\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Visual impairment (HP:0000505).\n    *   Strabismus (HP:0000486).\n    *   Nystagmus (HP:0000639).\n    *   Thin corpus callosum (HP:0002079).\n    *   Scoliosis (HP:0002650).\n    *   Tapered fingers (HP:0001182).\n    *   Stereotypical hand movements (HP:0000733).\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Onset is typically in the neonatal period or early infancy.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype is generally described as severe, particularly concerning intellectual and developmental disabilities.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Both heterozygous missense and loss-of-function (frameshift, nonsense) variants have been reported to cause a similar phenotype of severe intellectual and developmental disability.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Current literature does not define specific phenotype patterns correlated with different protein domains.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is emerging, with a limited number of published cases making strong conclusions difficult. All reported pathogenic variants are associated with a severe neurodevelopmental phenotype.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** The de novo frameshift variant c.277del (p.Ala93Profs*11) and the de novo missense variant c.466T>C (p.Tyr156His) both resulted in severe global developmental delay, absent speech, motor delay, and intellectual disability.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **c.466T>C (p.Tyr156His):**\n    *   **Significance:** Likely Pathogenic.\n    *   **Phenotypes:** Severe global developmental delay (HP:0001263), Absent speech (HP:0001344), Motor delay (HP:0001270), Intellectual disability, severe (HP:0010864).\n    *   **Allele Frequency (gnomAD):** Not reported.\n*   **c.277del (p.Ala93Profs*11):**\n    *   **Significance:** Likely Pathogenic.\n    *   **Phenotypes:** Severe global developmental delay (HP:0001263), Absent speech (HP:0001344), Motor delay (HP:0001270), Intellectual disability, severe (HP:0010864).\n    *   **Allele Frequency (gnomAD):** Not reported.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx):** The gene has broad expression across many tissues, with the highest levels observed in the testis. Significant expression is also noted in the brain, which is consistent with the observed neurodevelopmental phenotype.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The prominent neurological features, such as intellectual disability and seizures, correlate well with the gene's expression in various brain regions.\n*   **Expression During Development:** While specific developmental expression data is limited, the early onset of symptoms suggests a critical role during prenatal or early postnatal development.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** FAM86B1 is a protein methyltransferase that specifically methylates the \u03b5-amino group of a conserved lysine residue in the Eukaryotic Elongation Factor 2 (EEF2).\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** Haploinsufficiency is the likely disease mechanism, as loss-of-function variants are associated with the phenotype and the gene is intolerant to such changes.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of FAM86B1 function leads to loss of EEF2 methylation, which may impair the regulation of protein synthesis, a crucial process for normal neuronal development and function.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield:** The diagnostic yield is currently unknown as FAM86B1 is a recently identified disease gene and not typically included in standard intellectual disability gene panels.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** This gene would be tested in individuals with unexplained severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and/or motor delays, particularly when initial genetic testing (e.g., chromosomal microarray) is uninformative.\n*   **Clinical Actionability:** There are currently no specific treatments for FAM86B1-related intellectual developmental disorder. Management is supportive and symptomatic, including physical, occupational, and speech therapy, as well as seizure management.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and the high likelihood of de novo occurrence in individuals with unaffected parents. The recurrence risk for parents of a child with a de novo pathogenic variant is low, but not zero due to the possibility of germline mosaicism.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 35140131 (2022):** This study identified de novo heterozygous missense and loss-of-function variants in FAM86B1 in two individuals, establishing the gene's link to a severe neurodevelopmental disorder (MRT73). Key phenotypes included severe global developmental delay, intellectual disability, and motor delay.\n*   **PMID: 34999859 (2022):** This research characterized FAM86B1 as the enzyme responsible for methylating lysine-525 in EEF2, providing a molecular basis for its function and the potential pathway disrupted in the associated disease.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Both loss-of-function and missense variants in FAM86B1 are strongly associated with a core phenotype of severe global developmental delay (HP:0001263), severe intellectual disability (HP:0010864), and delayed or absent speech (HP:0000750).\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The combination of severe, early-onset global developmental delay with motor deficits and lack of speech should prompt consideration of pathogenic variants in FAM86B1, especially after more common causes have been excluded.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of MRT73 overlaps with numerous other monogenic neurodevelopmental disorders. Genes involved in other forms of autosomal dominant intellectual disability should be considered in the differential diagnosis.\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in FAM86B1 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "PCDHB16": "PCDHB16 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **PCDHB16 Gene Dossier**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 14546\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 606345\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While directly causative links to a specific Mendelian disease are not yet definitively established, *PCDHB16* has been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The broader Protocadherin Beta Cluster, to which *PCDHB16* belongs, is associated with conditions like microcephaly.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of variants in *PCDHB16* is still under investigation, and as of now, it would be considered to have a limited or uncertain level of evidence for causing a specific disease.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Given its potential role in neurodevelopmental disorders, both de novo mutations and inherited variants could be relevant, but specific inheritance patterns for *PCDHB16*-related phenotypes have not been clearly defined.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** As of the latest gnomAD data, specific constraint metrics for *PCDHB16* are not prominently reported in top-level search results. Generally, a pLI score \u2265 0.9 indicates a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) mutations. The Loss-of-function Observed/Expected Upper bound Fraction (LOEUF) is a newer metric, with lower values suggesting higher constraint.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** High pLI and low LOEUF scores for a gene suggest that LoF variants are not tolerated in the general population and are more likely to be pathogenic, often associated with a haploinsufficient disease mechanism. Without specific scores for *PCDHB16*, interpretation remains general.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For genes intolerant to LoF, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants are most likely to be pathogenic. The pathogenicity of missense variants would depend on their location and functional impact.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As direct disease correlations are limited, a comprehensive list of HPO terms is not available. Based on its association with Autism Spectrum Disorder, relevant HPO terms would include:\n    *   HP:0000717 - Autism\n    *   HP:0000729 - Autistic behavior\n    *   HP:0001249 - Intellectual disability\n    *   HP:0002376 - Developmental regression\n    *   HP:0001250 - Seizures\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Given the gene's function in neuronal connectivity, other potential, less frequently documented HPO terms might relate to broader neurodevelopmental or neurological abnormalities.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** For neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, the age of onset is typically in early childhood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders can range from mild to severe.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** There is currently insufficient data to establish clear correlations between specific *PCDHB16* variant classes and distinct phenotypes.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The PCDHB16 protein contains multiple cadherin domains in its extracellular region. Variants in these domains could disrupt cell-cell adhesion, but specific phenotype patterns linked to these domains have not been described.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlations for *PCDHB16* is currently weak to non-existent due to a lack of sufficient clinical case data.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   A search of ClinVar did not yield well-characterized pathogenic variants for *PCDHB16* with detailed phenotype associations. The UniProt database notes over 1,200 variants, but their clinical significance is largely not established.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides data on RNA-seq expression. While specific TPM values were not retrieved in the search, *PCDHB16* is noted to have expression in the brain, which is consistent with its proposed neurological function. Expression is also noted in various other tissues including the testis, stomach, and skin. Mouse ortholog data shows high expression in the epididymis.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Based on brain expression, phenotypes would be expected to be primarily neurological, including cognitive and behavioral abnormalities.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** As a protocadherin, *PCDHB16* is likely involved in developmental processes, particularly the establishment of neuronal connections. Therefore, pathogenic variants would be expected to manifest as congenital or early-onset neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *PCDHB16* encodes a potential calcium-dependent cell-adhesion protein that may be involved in establishing and maintaining specific neuronal connections in the brain.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The likely disease mechanism for a LoF variant in a constrained gene would be haploinsufficiency, where the loss of one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause disease. Other mechanisms like dominant-negative effects are also possible.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** As a cell-adhesion molecule, disruption of *PCDHB16* would likely impair homophilic cell-cell adhesion, affecting synapse formation and maintenance. This could lead to aberrant neural circuitry, manifesting as neurodevelopmental phenotypes.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** *PCDHB16* is part of the protocadherin beta cluster, and these proteins are known to interact with other cadherins and intracellular signaling molecules to regulate cellular processes.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield of testing *PCDHB16* in clinical cohorts with neurodevelopmental disorders is currently unknown but likely very low given the limited evidence for its role in disease.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for *PCDHB16* would most likely occur as part of a large gene panel or whole-exome sequencing for individuals with unexplained neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorder.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no specific management guidelines related to *PCDHB16* variants. Management would be based on the patient's observed phenotypes.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counselors should emphasize the uncertain clinical significance of most *PCDHB16* variants. The discussion would revolve around the gene's potential role in neurodevelopment and the limited data available to predict penetrance and expressivity.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   Currently, there are no landmark clinical studies that have definitively established a genotype-phenotype correlation for *PCDHB16*. Research has primarily focused on the genomic organization of the protocadherin cluster and its general role in neuronal development. Publications listed in GeneCards and NCBI are mainly related to the gene family and its expression.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** At present, there are no high-confidence associations between specific *PCDHB16* variants and HPO terms.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The presence of core features of Autism Spectrum Disorder (e.g., HP:0000717 - Autism, HP:0000729 - Autistic behavior) in a patient with a rare, predicted LoF variant in *PCDHB16* might raise suspicion, but this would not be considered a strong indicator on its own.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of autism spectrum disorder is highly heterogeneous and is associated with hundreds of other genes. A differential diagnosis would include a wide range of other syndromic and non-syndromic causes of autism and intellectual disability.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in PCDHB16 (2/2):\nN/A.

        "ANKRD30A": "ANKRD30A Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 17234.\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 610856.\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Primarily associated with breast cancer. It has also been investigated in the context of other cancers like bladder cancer and melanoma, and a potential link to myopia-related traits has been suggested.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The role of ANKRD30A in Mendelian disease is not well-established. Its primary clinical relevance is in oncology, particularly as a biomarker in breast cancer.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No clear inheritance pattern for a Mendelian disorder has been defined.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI:** 0.00.\n*   **LOEUF:** 1.29.\n*   **pRec:** Not available.\n*   **pNull:** Not available.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The pLI score of 0.00 and LOEUF score of 1.29 indicate that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variants. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Currently, there is insufficient evidence to associate specific variant classes with pathogenicity for a Mendelian phenotype. In the context of cancer, altered expression levels (down-regulation) are more significant than specific variant classes.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\nNo definitive Mendelian phenotype or associated HPO terms have been established for ANKRD30A. Its clinical association is primarily with cancer phenotypes.\n\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** None established.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** None established.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable for a Mendelian disorder. In cancer, it is studied in the context of adult-onset disease.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable for a Mendelian disorder.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific genotype-phenotype correlations for Mendelian disease are not described. In breast cancer, low ANKRD30A expression is associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a more aggressive subtype, and larger tumor size.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No specific patterns have been established that link variants in particular protein domains to distinct phenotypes.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable for Mendelian disease.\n*   **Examples: specific variants \u2192 specific phenotypes:** No specific pathogenic variants are consistently linked to a Mendelian phenotype.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\nThere are no well-characterized pathogenic variants for ANKRD30A reported in ClinVar associated with a Mendelian disease phenotype. The database primarily lists variants of uncertain significance or those related to cancer predisposition with varying interpretations.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** ANKRD30A is highly and specifically expressed in breast mammary tissue and testis. This breast-specific expression is relevant to its role as a biomarker in breast cancer.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its expression pattern, altered function could theoretically lead to phenotypes in the breast or testis, but this is speculative.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression has been noted in the developing human brain, but the significance is unclear. Its primary clinical relevance is in adult-onset cancers.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The gene encodes a DNA-binding transcription factor.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism observed in cancer is altered gene expression, specifically down-regulation. Haploinsufficiency is unlikely given the gnomAD constraint metrics. The roles of dominant-negative or gain-of-function variants have not been described for any disease.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** In breast cancer, down-regulation of ANKRD30A is associated with the activation of cell-cycle-related signaling pathways, which can promote cell proliferation. It may also be involved in estrogen signaling pathways.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** ANKRD30A contains ankyrin repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions, but specific interactions linked to a disease phenotype are not well-defined.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for ANKRD30A is not standard for diagnosing Mendelian disorders.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is primarily done in a research context, especially for breast cancer prognostication and subtyping.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** In breast cancer, low expression of ANKRD30A is associated with a poorer prognosis, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, which may guide therapeutic strategies in the future.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Currently, there are no established genetic counseling guidelines for this gene in the context of inherited diseases.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 32558282, Year: 2020:** Identified ANKRD30A as one of only 96 breast-specific transcripts in the human genome and showed its downregulation in triple-negative breast cancer is associated with a poorer prognosis.\n*   **PMID: 35342777, Year: 2022:** Confirmed that low ANKRD30A expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size in triple-negative breast cancer and that a four-gene panel including ANKRD30A was significantly associated with survival.\n*   **PMID: 16675566, Year: 2006:** Described the nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of the ANKRD30A protein (NY-BR-1) in primary breast cancer and lymph node metastases.\n*   **PMID: 11313741, Year: 2001:** First cloned ANKRD30A (termed NY-BR-1) and identified its expression in breast cancer and normal mammary and testis tissue.\n*   **A dissertation by Chen, C. (2020)** provided a comprehensive review of ANKRD30A's breast-specific expression, its downregulation in ER-negative breast cancer, and its role in cell cycle signaling.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** None established. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a standardized vocabulary for human disease phenotypes, but currently, no specific HPO terms are definitively associated with variants in ANKRD30A for a Mendelian disorder.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are currently no \"red flag\" HPO terms that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in ANKRD30A is the cause of a patient's primary phenotype.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Not applicable in the context of Mendelian disease. In oncology, its expression pattern is used to help differentiate breast cancer subtypes.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in ANKRD30A (2/2):\nN/A.

The high LOEUF score further supports that the gene is not constrained against inactivating mutations.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Based on constraint scores, loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice-site) are highly unlikely to be pathogenic. There is no evidence to suggest any variant class is associated with disease.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** No HPO terms are associated with variants in the FRG2 gene.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No HPO terms are associated with variants in the FRG2 gene.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable, as no associated phenotype has been identified.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** No genotype-phenotype correlations have been established for FRG2.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No protein domains are known to be associated with specific phenotypes.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** No pathogenic variants with associated phenotypes have been documented.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   No variants classified as Pathogenic or Likely Pathogenic for any clinical phenotype have been reported in ClinVar for the FRG2 gene.\n*   Variants listed in ClinVar are predominantly classified as Benign or variants of Uncertain Significance.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx v8):** The highest expression of FRG2 is observed in the Testis.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Low expression across most somatic tissues and high tolerance to LoF variants make tissue-specific phenotypes unlikely. No tissue-specific phenotypes are currently known.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Developmental expression patterns and their relation to age-related phenotypes are not characterized.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** FRG2 is thought to be involved in chromatin organization and nuclear structure.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** No disease mechanism has been identified for FRG2. The gene appears tolerant to haploinsufficiency.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** No known disruptions in cellular or molecular pathways involving FRG2 lead to a clinical phenotype.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** No specific protein-protein interactions have been linked to a clinical phenotype.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for FRG2 is effectively zero, as it is not associated with any known Mendelian disease.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** This gene is generally not a target for clinical diagnostic testing. It may be analyzed as part of a broad research sequencing effort in patients with suspected FSHD, but it is not the causative gene.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are no clinical actions or management guidelines associated with variants in FRG2.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the lack of evidence for pathogenicity, counselors should be cautious about attributing causality to FRG2 variants. The high tolerance to LoF variation should be emphasized.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   There are no landmark clinical papers establishing a genotype-phenotype correlation for FRG2. Publications have investigated it as a candidate gene for FSHD, but have largely excluded it as being causative for the classic disease presentation.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** There are no known high-confidence associations between HPO terms and FRG2 variants.\n*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are no specific HPO terms that would suggest pathogenic variants in the FRG2 gene.\n*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Not applicable, as there is no primary phenotype associated with FRG2.\n\n***\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in FRG2 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "BMP8A": "BMP8A Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n\u2013 **HGNC ID**: 21650\n\u2013 **OMIM Gene ID**: 620847\n\u2013 **Primary Disease Associations**: No definitive monogenic disease associations have been established in OMIM or ClinVar. GeneCards lists associations with Vestibular Nystagmus and Photoallergic Dermatitis, though the evidence for these is not specified.\n\u2013 **Clinical Significance Level**: The clinical significance of BMP8A in Mendelian disease is currently uncertain.\n\u2013 **Inheritance Patterns**: No clear inheritance patterns have been described in patients for any specific disease.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n\u2013 **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI of 0.00, a LOEUF of 1.18, pRec of 0.81, and pNull of 0.19.\n\u2013 **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The low pLI score (closer to 0) and high LOEUF score (greater than 1) suggest that BMP8A is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. This indicates that haploinsufficiency is not a likely mechanism of disease for this gene.\n\u2013 **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be gain-of-function or have dominant-negative effects. However, there is currently no strong evidence for this.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n\u2013 **Primary HPO terms**: Currently, no specific HPO terms are definitively associated with pathogenic variants in BMP8A in human patients.\n\u2013 **Secondary HPO terms**: No secondary HPO terms are currently documented in relation to BMP8A variants in humans.\n\u2013 **Age of Onset Patterns**: Not applicable as no clear disease phenotype is established.\n\u2013 **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Not applicable.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n\u2013 **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: There are no established correlations between variant classes and specific phenotypes for BMP8A.\n\u2013 **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: Information on protein domain-specific phenotypes is not available.\n\u2013 **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: Not applicable.\n\u2013 **Examples**: A study on peripheral arterial disease (PAD) found a genome-wide significant association for the interaction between traffic exposure and the variant rs755249, located in the 3' UTR of BMP8A. However, this is a complex association and not a monogenic disease correlation.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n\u2013 No variants in BMP8A have been classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for a Mendelian disorder in ClinVar.\n\u2013 The variant rs755249 has been associated with peripheral arterial disease in the context of traffic exposure, but its clinical significance is listed as uncertain.\n\u2013 One missense variant, c.878G>A (p.Arg293His), is listed in ClinVar with a classification of \"uncertain significance\".\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n\u2013 **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM)**: According to GeneCards, BMP8A has the highest expression in the thyroid gland. It is also expressed in the testis. Studies have noted its expression in lung and bone marrow cells.\n\u2013 **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Based on mouse models and human tissue expression, potential phenotypes could relate to male fertility (spermatogenesis, epididymal function), bone metabolism, and adipose tissue regulation. Aberrant expression has been noted in some cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and triple-negative breast cancer.\n\u2013 **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: In mice, Bmp8a is expressed in male germ cells during the initiation and maintenance of spermatogenesis.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n\u2013 **Normal Gene Function**: BMP8A is a secreted signaling protein from the TGF-beta superfamily that induces cartilage and bone formation and is involved in the regulation of thermogenesis, energy balance, and spermatogenesis.\n\u2013 **Disease Mechanism**: Given the gnomAD constraint scores, haploinsufficiency is an unlikely disease mechanism. The specific mechanism for any potential disease association is unknown.\n\u2013 **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences**: BMP8A signals through the canonical BMP pathway by binding to type I and type II receptors, leading to the phosphorylation of SMAD transcription factors (SMAD1/5/8 and SMAD2/3). Disruption of this signaling in animal models affects fertility and metabolism.\n\u2013 **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: BMP8A interacts with BMP receptors (BMPR1A, BMPR2) and activin receptors (ACVR2A, ACVR2B, ALK4, ALK5) to initiate signaling. In mouse studies, genetic interaction with Bmp7 exacerbates spermatogenesis and epididymal defects.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n\u2013 **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: The diagnostic yield for BMP8A is expected to be very low to none, as it is not currently associated with a well-defined monogenic disorder.\n\u2013 **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: Testing for this gene would primarily be on a research basis, for instance in cohorts with unexplained male infertility, metabolic disorders, or certain cancers.\n\u2013 **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: There are currently no clinical actionability guidelines for variants in BMP8A.\n\u2013 **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling would focus on the uncertainty of any findings in BMP8A, explaining that there is no established evidence to classify variants as pathogenic for a specific disease.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n\u2013 **PMID: 27082954, 2016**: Reported a genome-wide significant interaction between variant rs755249 in BMP8A and traffic exposure in relation to peripheral arterial disease.\n\u2013 **PMID: 37785535, 2023**: Showed that Bmp8a deletion in zebrafish leads to obesity and fatty liver by affecting fatty acid oxidation and adipocyte differentiation via the Smad2/3 pathway.\n\u2013 **PMID: 38293126, 2024**: Found that BMP8A is upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and associated with poorer distant metastasis-free survival, enhancing cancer cell invasion and migration.\n\u2013 **PMID: 11784057, 2001**: A study in mice demonstrating that a mutation in Bmp7 worsens the spermatogenesis and epididymis phenotype of Bmp8a mutant mice, suggesting functional redundancy.\n\u2013 **PMID: 9506538, 1998**: Landmark study in mice that inactivated the Bmp8a gene, establishing its role in the maintenance of spermatogenesis and the integrity of the epididymis.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n\u2013 **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: There are currently no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for BMP8A.\n\u2013 **Phenotype red flags**: No specific HPO terms are considered red flags for pathogenic variants in BMP8A at this time.\n\u2013 **Differential diagnosis considerations**: Given the expression pattern and animal model data, genes involved in male infertility (e.g., BMP8B, BMP7), congenital hypothyroidism, or disorders of bone and mineral metabolism might be considered in a differential diagnosis if a patient presents with relevant features and a variant of uncertain significance in BMP8A.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in BMP8A (1/1):\nN/A. Variant: 1:39511903 C>T | Gene: BMP8A | GT: 1|0 | IDs: rs6526, COSV59032693 | AF: 1KG=N/A, gnomAD=0.6822, gnomADg=0.6459 | ACMG: Benign (BA1, BP4, BP7, BS1) | ClinVar: N/A | Scores: SIFT=N/A, Polyphen=N/A, CADD=N/A, REVEL=N/A, SpliceAI=BMP8A (AG=0.00, AL=0.00, DG=0.00, DL=0.00), DANN=N/A, MetalR=N/A | Alpha Missense: N/A (N/A) | OMIM: N/A",
        "TPSB2": "TPSB2 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 14120\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 191081\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (H\u03b1T) is strongly associated with copy number variations at the tryptase locus, which includes *TPSB2* and *TPSAB1*. Elevated basal serum tryptase is a key feature, often linked to symptoms of mast cell activation.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of the *TPSB2* gene is intrinsically linked with the *TPSAB1* gene at the same locus; duplications of the *TPSAB1* allele are the primary cause of Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia (H\u03b1T). The evidence for the association between the H\u03b1T genotype and clinical phenotypes is considered strong.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The H\u03b1T trait is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.\n\n### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) of 0.00, a pRec of 0.58, and a pNull of 0.42. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) score is a more current metric for intolerance to loss-of-function variation. Specific LOEUF scores for *TPSB2* are not readily available in the initial search results, but the low pLI suggests the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function variants.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The very low pLI score (close to 0) indicates that *TPSB2* is not constrained and is tolerant to heterozygous protein-truncating variants. This is consistent with findings of functional \"knockout\" or null alleles in the general population.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** The primary pathogenic mechanism is not single nucleotide variants but copy number variation (CNV) of the tryptase locus, particularly duplications of the adjacent *TPSAB1* gene. A frameshift null allele in *TPSB2* (\u03b2III<sup>FS</sup>) is present in about 20% of the population, further supporting its tolerance to LoF.\n\n### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As *TPSB2* phenotypes are linked to H\u03b1T, associated HPO terms include those related to mast cell activation and connective tissue abnormalities. Common terms include:\n    *   Urticaria (HP:0001025)\n    *   Flushing (HP:0001035)\n    *   Pruritus (HP:0000989)\n    *   Anaphylaxis (HP:0002237)\n    *   Gastrointestinal dysmotility (HP:0002019)\n    *   Diarrhea (HP:0002014)\n    *   Abdominal pain (HP:0002027)\n    *   Arthralgia (HP:0002829)\n    *   Myalgia (HP:0003326)\n    *   Fatigue (HP:0012378)\n    *   Tachycardia (HP:0001649)\n    *   Hypotension (HP:0001272)\n    *   Syncope (HP:0001279)\n    *   Headache (HP:0002315)\n    *   Anxiety (HP:0000739)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Ehlers-Danlos-like syndrome (HP:0002434)\n    *   Joint hypermobility (HP:0001382)\n    *   Osteoporosis (HP:0000938)\n    *   Thyroid disease\n    *   Irritable bowel syndrome (HP:0100280)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Symptoms can manifest at any age, but are often recognized in adulthood.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic individuals with elevated basal serum tryptase to severe, multi-systemic symptoms including recurrent anaphylaxis.\n\n### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** The key genotype is an increased copy number of the *TPSAB1* gene (Hereditary alpha-tryptasemia), which is co-inherited with *TPSB2*. This leads to elevated basal serum tryptase and a wide range of allergic, gastrointestinal, and connective tissue-related symptoms. There is a gene-dose effect, where a higher number of \u03b1-tryptase copies can be associated with higher tryptase levels.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Not applicable, as the primary mechanism is copy number variation of the gene locus rather than domain-specific missense mutations.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between the H\u03b1T genotype (increased *TPSAB1* copies) and elevated basal serum tryptase is strong. The correlation between the genotype and specific clinical symptoms is moderate, as many carriers are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** The presence of a *TPSAB1* duplication or triplication is directly correlated with elevated basal serum tryptase levels. For instance, each additional tandem *TPSAB1* \u03b1 allele contributes approximately 10 ng/ml to the basal serum tryptase level.\n\n### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\nThe primary \"variants\" of clinical significance are copy number gains at the tryptase locus. Characterization focuses on allele copy counts rather than single nucleotide variants.\n*   **Genotype:** Increased *TPSAB1* \u03b1 allele copy number (Duplication) / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Reported Phenotypes (HPO Terms):** Elevated serum tryptase level (HP:0030283), Anaphylaxis (HP:0002237), Flushing (HP:0001035), Urticaria (HP:0001025), Gastrointestinal dysmotility (HP:0002019), Joint hypermobility (HP:0001382) / **AF:** Found in ~4-8% of general populations of European ancestry.\n*   **Genotype:** Increased *TPSAB1* \u03b1 allele copy number (Triplication) / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Reported Phenotypes (HPO Terms):** Higher basal serum tryptase levels than duplications, associated with a similar but potentially more severe spectrum of symptoms. / **AF:** Less common than duplications.\n*   **Genotype:** *TPSB2* \u03b2III frameshift null allele (\u03b2III<sup>FS</sup>) / **Significance:** Benign / **Reported Phenotypes:** None; considered a benign polymorphism. / **AF:** ~20% of the population.\n\n### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, *TPSB2* expression is highest in the lung, stomach, and esophagus (mucosa), with notable expression in the gallbladder and skin.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in mast cells within the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and skin directly correlates with the observed clinical phenotypes of asthma, gastrointestinal distress (diarrhea, pain), and skin manifestations (urticaria, flushing, pruritus).\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Tryptase is a major protease in mast cells, which are present throughout life. Expression in synovium has been linked to osteoarthritis in overweight patients, suggesting a role in age-related inflammatory conditions.\n\n### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** *TPSB2* encodes the \u03b2-tryptase subunit of tryptase, a major serine protease stored in and released from mast cell granules upon activation.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism is a gain-of-function due to gene dosage. Increased copies of the tryptase gene, particularly *TPSAB1*, lead to higher baseline levels of circulating tryptase, which can lower the threshold for mast cell-related symptoms.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Elevated tryptase can activate protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) on neurons, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells, contributing to neurogenic inflammation, pain, and vascular permeability (flushing, hypotension). The formation of \u03b1/\u03b2-tryptase heterotetramers, which occurs in H\u03b1T, creates an enzyme with a novel substrate repertoire that may underlie some clinical features.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Tryptase is only active as a heparin-stabilized homotetramer (\u03b24) or heterotetramer (\u03b12\u03b22). The formation of \u03b12\u03b22 heterotetramers in H\u03b1T is critical to the disease's pathophysiology.\n\n### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In patients with elevated basal serum tryptase (\u226511.4 \u00b5g/L), tryptase genotyping identifies an increased *TPSAB1* copy number (H\u03b1T) in up to 93% of cases. H\u03b1T is found in ~18% of patients with mastocytosis and ~29% of patients with non-clonal mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is indicated for patients with unexplained symptoms of mast cell activation (e.g., recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis, flushing, urticaria), suspected mastocytosis, or a family history of elevated tryptase.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Identifying H\u03b1T can provide a diagnosis for patients with chronic multi-system symptoms, guide management (e.g., use of mast cell stabilizers, antihistamines), and help assess risk for severe reactions to triggers like insect stings. It is also critical for interpreting tryptase levels in patients with systemic mastocytosis.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Counseling should address the variable expressivity of the condition, where many individuals with the genetic trait may be asymptomatic. Testing of at-risk family members can be considered.\n\n### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 37241913, Year: 2023:** Discusses the utility of tryptase genotyping in the diagnosis and management of systemic mastocytosis, highlighting how H\u03b1T impacts the interpretation of basal serum tryptase levels.\n*   **PMID: 34188583, Year: 2021:** Reports on modeled basal serum tryptase (BST) reference ranges based on the number of tandem *TPSAB1* \u03b1 alleles, establishing a clear gene-dose effect.\n*   **PMID: 32679093, Year: 2020:** Provides a comprehensive review on the genetic regulation of tryptase production, describing canonical genotypes (0\u03b1:4\u03b2, 1\u03b1:3\u03b2, 2\u03b1:2\u03b2) and the clinical impact of H\u03b1T.\n*   **PMID: 29997237, Year: 2018:** Describes the allele-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) method for precise quantification of alpha- and beta-tryptase gene copies to diagnose H\u03b1T.\n*   **PMID: 27596532, Year: 2016 (Lyons et al.):** Landmark study that first described the association between increased copy number of the alpha-tryptase gene (*TPSAB1*), elevated basal tryptase, and a multi-system disorder now known as H\u03b1T.\n\n### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** An increased copy number of the *TPSAB1* allele at the tryptase locus (co-inherited with *TPSB2*) is strongly associated with **Elevated serum tryptase level (HP:0030283)**. This genotype is also frequently associated with a symptom complex that includes **Anaphylaxis (HP:0002237)**, **Flushing (HP:0001035)**, **Urticaria (HP:0001025)**, **Pruritus (HP:0000989)**, **Gastrointestinal dysmotility (HP:0002019)**, and **Joint hypermobility (HP:0001382)**.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of a chronically elevated basal serum tryptase level in the context of multi-systemic symptoms, particularly those involving allergic, gastrointestinal, and connective tissue systems, strongly suggests testing for H\u03b1T. Recurrent, unexplained anaphylaxis is a significant red flag.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of H\u03b1T overlaps significantly with other mast cell disorders, including systemic mastocytosis and non-clonal mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). The presence of joint hypermobility and skin hyperextensibility creates an overlap with Ehlers-Danlos syndromes. Tryptase genotyping is crucial to differentiate these conditions.\n\n\n\nPatient Variants in TPSB2 (1/1):\nN/A.

        "CCDC110": "CCDC110 Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **Gene Dossier: CCDC110**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** 28504\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 609488\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Currently, no definitive disease associations are listed in OMIM for CCDC110. However, it is implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma progression. It has also been studied in the context of pulmonary function.\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of CCDC110 in Mendelian disease is not yet established.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Not applicable as no Mendelian disease is currently linked to this gene.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v2.1.1 reports a pLI of 0.00, and a LOEUF of 1.13. Missense Z-score is -0.92.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores suggest that CCDC110 is tolerant to loss-of-function variation. Genes with these scores are generally not considered candidates for diseases caused by haploinsufficiency.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the tolerance to loss-of-function variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might be missense with a specific gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect, though this is speculative.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:** As CCDC110 is not currently associated with a Mendelian disorder, there are no established primary HPO terms.\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are definitively linked to CCDC110 variants in a clinical setting.\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** No established correlations exist between specific variant classes and phenotypes for CCDC110-related Mendelian disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The protein contains a coiled-coil domain, a leucine zipper motif, and nuclear localization signals, but specific phenotype patterns have not been linked to these domains in a clinical genetic context.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:** A deletion of the 4q35.1q35.2 region, which includes CCDC110, was reported in an asymptomatic family, suggesting that loss of one copy of this gene may not lead to an obvious clinical phenotype.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   As there are no confirmed pathogenic variants in ClinVar associated with a Mendelian phenotype, this section is not applicable. Most listed variants in databases like dbSNP are common polymorphisms.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** CCDC110 shows the highest expression in the testis and pancreas. Its expression in various cancers, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, suggests a role in tumorigenesis.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given the high testis expression, a potential role in male infertility could be considered, though no such association has been established. Its association with pulmonary function in a GWAS study might suggest a role in respiratory phenotypes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Specific data on developmental expression and its link to age-related phenotypes is not readily available.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function in One Sentence:** CCDC110 is a coiled-coil domain-containing protein that localizes to the nucleus and centrosomes and is involved in cell cycle regulation.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** In the context of cancer, the mechanism appears to be related to overexpression promoting cell proliferation and migration. For potential Mendelian disease, the mechanism is unknown.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** In hepatocellular carcinoma, CCDC110 interacts with and stabilizes TGFBR1, activating the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling pathway, which promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhances malignant behavior.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction between CCDC110 and TGFBR1 is critical for its role in promoting hepatocellular carcinoma progression.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for CCDC110 variants is currently zero, as it is not included in standard gene panels for specific inherited diseases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for this gene is generally not performed in a clinical diagnostic setting for inherited diseases. It is primarily a subject of cancer research.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are no clinical actionability guidelines for variants in CCDC110.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Genetic counseling would focus on the lack of evidence for CCDC110 in causing Mendelian disease and the uncertain significance of any identified rare variants. The reported asymptomatic deletion carriers should be noted.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **PMID: 38769395, 2025:** Demonstrated that high expression of CCDC110 in hepatocellular carcinoma promotes tumor progression by activating the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD pathway through interaction with TGFBR1.\n*   **PMID: 34737220, 2021:** Reported a familial 4.5-Mb deletion at 4q35.1q35.2, including CCDC110, in asymptomatic individuals, suggesting this deletion does not cause obvious congenital defects.\n*   **PMID: 15447989, 2004:** First identified CCDC110 (as KM-HN-1) as a novel human cancer/testis antigen, recognized by both cellular and humoral immune responses, and expressed in tumors.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence associations between HPO terms and CCDC110 variants for Mendelian disorders.\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are no established \"red flag\" HPO terms that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in CCDC110.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Given the lack of a defined phenotype, differential diagnosis is not applicable.

If the muscles extending the hip joint are affected, the posture in that joint becomes flexed and lumbar lordosis increases. The patients usually have difficulties standing up from a sitting position. Due to weakness in the gluteus medius muscle, the hip on the side of the swinging leg drops with each step (referred to as Trendelenburg sign). The gait appears waddling. The patients frequently attempt to counteract the dropping of the hip on the swinging side by bending the trunk towards the side which is in the stance phase (in the German language literature this is referred to as Duchenne sign). Similar gait patterns can be caused by orthopedic conditions when the origin and the insertion site of the gluteus medius muscle are closer to each other than normal, for instance due to a posttraumatic elevation of the trochanter or pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck.\" [PMID:27770207] | Synonyms: Waddling gait, Waddling walk\nHP:0003236 | Elevated circulating creatine kinase concentration | \"An elevation of the level of the enzyme creatine kinase (also known as creatine phosphokinase (CK; EC 2.7.3.2) in the blood.
