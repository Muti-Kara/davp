This gene, along with several associated transcripts and regulatory elements (TF Binding Sites, Histone Modification Sites, ChromHMM States, chr_chain), has been linked to a broad spectrum of phenotypes through GWAS associations.\n\n**GWAS Associations:**\n\nThe genetic entities associated with this variant show strong links to:\n\n*   **Hematological Traits:** Granulocyte percentage of myeloid white cells, monocyte count, monocyte percentage of leukocytes, and basophil count.\n*   **Metabolic and Cardiovascular Risk Factors:** Fibrinogen measurement, triglyceride measurement, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement.\n*   **Behavioral Traits:** Alcohol drinking and alcohol consumption measurement.\n*   **Hormonal and Protein Levels:** Sex hormone-binding globulin measurement, serum albumin measurement, and blood protein measurement.\n*   **Growth Factors:** IGF-1 measurement.\n*   **Hemoglobin Levels:** Hemoglobin measurement.\n\n**ClinVar Associations:**\n\nThe ClinVar database indicates that variants within the analyzed genetic entities, particularly those related to the CAPN3 gene, are strongly associated with **muscular dystrophies**. The most prominent phenotypes reported for non-benign variants include:\n\n*   **Autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A)**, which is the most frequently reported phenotype.\n*   **Muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle, autosomal dominant 4**.\n*   **CAPN3-related disorder**.\n*   **Inborn genetic diseases**.\n*   **Abnormality of the musculature**.\n*   **Muscle weakness**.\n*   **Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, recessive**.\n\nOther associated phenotypes include cardiac arrhythmia, lower-limb joint contractures, calf muscle hypertrophy, shoulder girdle muscle weakness, congenital muscular dystrophy, myopathy, and absent Achilles reflex.\n\n### Pathogenicity Clues\n\nThe variant rs758058910 is classified as **pathogenic** in ClinVar, which is a strong indicator of its potential to cause disease. While the ACMG classification is \"Uncertain significance,\" the overwhelming evidence from ClinVar, particularly the high number of pathogenic variants associated with various forms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and CAPN3-related disorders, strongly suggests a pathogenic role for this variant. The association of the CAPN3 gene with these muscular dystrophies, coupled with the pathogenic ClinVar annotation of the variant, points towards a significant risk for these conditions. The GWAS associations with a range of physiological parameters, while broad, do not contradict a role in a complex genetic disorder affecting muscle function.\n\n**In summary, the variant rs758058910, located in or near the CAPN3 gene, is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of limb-girdle muscular dystrophies, particularly autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A.**\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== CAPN3 ===\nNo information available for gene CAPN3",

The analysis incorporates information from variant annotations, GWAS associations, and ClinVar data to assess potential impacts on genetic entities and associated phenotypes.\n\n### Variant Information:\n\n*   **rsID:** rs1799945\n*   **Chromosome:** 6\n*   **Position:** 26090951\n*   **Reference Allele (REF):** C\n*   **Alternative Allele (ALT):** G\n*   **Gene Name:** HFE\n*   **ClinVar Significance:** Includes classifications such as \"risk_factor\", \"pathogenic/likely_pathogenic\", and \"pathogenic\".\n*   **ACMG Classification:** Benign\n*   **Population Frequencies:** The variant is present in gnomAD (0.1351) and 1000 Genomes (0.0731), indicating it is not extremely rare.\n\n### Genetic Entities Affected:\n\nThe variant rs1799945 is located within or near the **HFE gene** and several associated **transcript** entities. Additionally, it is linked to various **TF Binding Sites** and **Histone Modification Sites**, as well as **ChromHMM States** and **Non-coding RNA** entities. This suggests potential regulatory roles or impacts on gene expression.\n\n### GWAS Associations:\n\nThe HFE gene and its associated entities show a broad range of GWAS associations, primarily related to:\n\n*   **Metabolic Traits:** High density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement, apolipoprotein A1 measurement, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, triglyceride measurement, total cholesterol measurement, BMI, body weight, body height, body fat percentage, waist circumference, hip circumference, and visceral adipose tissue measurement.\n*   **Hematological Parameters:** Red blood cell distribution width, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, platelet count, ferritin measurement, hemoglobin measurement, transferrin saturation measurement, serum iron measurement, reticulocyte count, and erythrocyte count.\n*   **Neurological and Psychiatric Conditions:** Obsolete schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, cognitive function measurement, depressive symptom measurement, neuroticism measurement, intelligence, wellbeing measurement, and worry measurement.\n*   **Other Traits:** Smoking status measurement, HbA1c measurement, gout, and allergic rhinitis.\n\n### ClinVar Annotations:\n\nClinVar data reveals a significant association of variants within the HFE gene with **hereditary hemochromatosis** and **hemochromatosis type 1**. Numerous entries indicate these conditions, with a substantial number of variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic for these disorders. Other associated phenotypes include:\n\n*   **Inborn genetic diseases**\n*   **HFE-related disorder**\n*   **Juvenile hemochromatosis**\n*   **Rahman syndrome**\n*   **Tessadori-Van Haaften neurodevelopmental syndrome 3**\n*   **Tessadori-van Haaften neurodevelopmental syndrome 1**\n*   **Neurodevelopmental disorder**\n*   **Syndromic intellectual disability**\n*   **Multiple myeloma**\n*   **Squamous cell lung carcinoma**\n*   **Breast ductal adenocarcinoma**\n*   **Doxorubicin response**\n*   **Neoplasm**\n*   **Global developmental delay**\n\n### Clues to Pathogenicity and Disease Association:\n\nThe variant rs1799945, while having a \"Benign\" ACMG classification, is listed in ClinVar with multiple \"risk_factor\" and \"pathogenic/likely_pathogenic\" significances. This suggests a complex role, potentially as a modifier or a low-penetrance risk factor.\n\nThe overwhelming association of variants in the HFE gene with **hereditary hemochromatosis** and **hemochromatosis type 1** in ClinVar is a strong indicator of its involvement in iron metabolism disorders. The presence of this variant, coupled with its \"risk_factor\" classification, suggests it may contribute to an increased risk of developing hemochromatosis, particularly in individuals with other genetic predispositions or environmental factors.\n\nThe broad range of GWAS associations, particularly with metabolic and hematological traits, further supports the role of HFE in systemic regulation. The association with neurological and psychiatric conditions, while less prominent than hemochromatosis, warrants consideration, especially given the complex nature of HFE's function.\n\n**In summary, while the ACMG classification is benign, the ClinVar data strongly implicates the HFE gene, and by extension this variant, as a risk factor for hereditary hemochromatosis. The extensive GWAS associations highlight its broader influence on metabolic and hematological parameters, and potentially on neurological and psychiatric phenotypes.** Further investigation into the specific functional impact of rs1799945 on HFE protein function and its interaction with other genetic and environmental factors would be beneficial for a comprehensive understanding of its pathogenicity.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== HFE ===\nNo information available for gene HFE",

It also overlaps with several non-coding RNA entities, histone modification sites, and ChromHMM states.\n\nGWAS associations for variants within these entities are linked to the following phenotypes:\n\n*   **Alkaline phosphatase measurement:** A marker for bone and liver disease.\n*   **Blood phosphate measurement:** Indicating a role in phosphorus levels.\n*   **Body height:** Suggesting a potential influence on stature.\n*   **Age at onset:** Implies a possible role in determining when a condition may manifest.\n*   **Obsolete Alzheimer's disease:** Associated with neurodegenerative processes and dementia.\n*   **FEV/FEC ratio:** Related to lung function.\n\n### ClinVar Data and Phenotype Associations:\n\nThe ClinVar database contains a substantial number of variants within the analyzed genetic entities, with a significant proportion classified as \"Uncertain significance\" (10091 variants). While there are also pathogenic and benign variants, the high number of uncertain significance variants highlights the complexity of interpreting variants in this region.\n\nThe non-benign variants in this region are strongly associated with a range of **inborn genetic diseases**, with a particular emphasis on:\n\n*   **Hypophosphatasia:** This is a recurring theme, with associations to infantile, childhood, adult, and general hypophosphatasia. This is further supported by associations with \"ALPL-related disorder\" and \"Decreased circulating alkaline phosphatase activity.\"\n*   **Schwartz-Jampel syndrome (types 1 and general):** This is another prominent phenotype, often appearing in conjunction with hypophosphatasia and Kniest-like syndrome.\n*   **Lethal Kniest-like syndrome:** Frequently observed alongside Schwartz-Jampel syndrome and other connective tissue disorders.\n*   **Connective tissue disorders:** A broader category that encompasses several of the more specific syndromes.\n*   **Qualitative or quantitative defects of perlecan:** This directly relates to the function of HSPG2, which encodes perlecan.\n*   **Microcephaly** and **Abnormal facial shape** are also noted.\n\n### Clues to Pathogenicity:\n\nThe variant rs543536558 is classified as \"uncertain significance\" in ClinVar. However, its location within the **HSPG2 gene**, which encodes perlecan, is highly significant. Perlecan is a crucial component of the extracellular matrix and plays a vital role in skeletal development, connective tissues, and basement membranes.\n\nThe strong and consistent association of variants within the HSPG2 locus in ClinVar with **hypophosphatasia, Schwartz-Jampel syndrome, and Lethal Kniest-like syndrome** provides a compelling rationale for investigating this variant further. These syndromes are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, connective tissue defects, and often metabolic disturbances related to alkaline phosphatase.\n\nThe GWAS associations with alkaline phosphatase measurement and blood phosphate measurement further support a potential role for variants in this region in metabolic bone diseases. While the variant itself is currently of uncertain significance, its genomic context and the established pathogenicity of other variants in the HSPG2 gene strongly suggest that chr1:21855423C>G could be pathogenic and contribute to phenotypes related to skeletal development, connective tissue integrity, and mineral metabolism. Further functional studies would be beneficial to definitively determine its pathogenicity.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== HSPG2 ===\nNo information available for gene HSPG2",

Additionally, it is associated with numerous **TF Binding Sites**, **Histone Modification Sites**, **DNase Hypersensitivity Sites**, **ChromHMM States**, and a **chr_chain** entity.\n\n**GWAS Associations:**\n\nThe genetic entities associated with this variant show strong enrichment for traits related to kidney function and mineral metabolism. Key associated phenotypes from GWAS include:\n\n*   **Kidney Function:** Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), creatinine measurement, chronic kidney disease.\n*   **Mineral Metabolism:** Phosphorus measurement, magnesium:calcium ratio.\n*   **Hematological Traits:** Hematocrit, hemoglobin measurement, red blood cell density measurement, erythrocyte count.\n*   **Other Conditions:** Acute myeloid leukemia, diabetes mellitus, and asthma (obsolete).\n\nThe sheer number of TF Binding Sites and Histone Modification Sites linked to **creatinine measurement** (GWAS_EFO_0004518) and **glomerular filtration rate** (GWAS_EFO_0005208) suggests a significant regulatory role for this genomic region concerning kidney function.\n\n**ClinVar Associations:**\n\nThe **SLC34A1 gene** is strongly associated with several genetic disorders, primarily affecting kidney and bone health. Non-benign variants in this gene are linked to:\n\n*   **SLC34A1-related disorder:** A broad category encompassing several specific conditions.\n*   **Hypercalcemia, infantile, 2:** Characterized by elevated calcium levels in infants.\n*   **Fanconi renotubular syndrome 2:** A disorder affecting the kidney tubules, leading to impaired reabsorption of various substances.\n*   **Hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis 1:** Associated with low phosphate levels, kidney stones, and bone abnormalities.\n*   **Inborn genetic diseases:** A general classification for inherited disorders.\n*   **Nephrocalcinosis:** Calcium deposits in the kidneys.\n*   **Nephrolithiasis:** Kidney stones.\n*   **Prostate cancer:** Notably, this is a less common association but present.\n*   **Osteogenesis imperfecta type III:** A severe form of brittle bone disease.\n*   **Large for gestational age:** A growth parameter.\n\nThe high number of variants with \"uncertain significance\" in ClinVar (3131 out of 6725 total analyzed) for this gene highlights the complexity in interpreting the pathogenicity of variants within SLC34A1. However, the substantial number of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (1389) associated with severe kidney and bone disorders is highly significant.\n\n### Clues to Pathogenicity:\n\nThe variant rs141770901 is located in the **SLC34A1 gene**, which is well-established to be involved in phosphate and calcium transport. The strong association of this gene with severe kidney disorders (Fanconi renotubular syndrome, chronic kidney disease, nephrolithiasis) and metabolic bone diseases (hypophosphatemic nephrolithiasis/osteoporosis, hypercalcemia) through ClinVar data provides a strong biological rationale for potential pathogenicity.\n\nThe GWAS data further supports the involvement of this genomic region in kidney function (GFR, creatinine) and mineral metabolism (phosphorus). The presence of numerous TF binding sites and histone modification sites in this region, particularly those linked to creatinine measurement and GFR, suggests that variants here could disrupt the regulatory control of SLC34A1 or nearby genes critical for kidney function.\n\nWhile the variant itself is classified as \"uncertain significance\" in ClinVar, its location within a gene with a clear and significant role in kidney and bone homeostasis, coupled with the strong GWAS associations with related phenotypes, raises suspicion. The low population frequency also makes it less likely to be a benign variant. Further investigation into the functional impact of this specific variant on SLC34A1 expression or function would be crucial for a definitive assessment of its pathogenicity. The pattern of associated diseases points towards a potential role in disorders of mineral metabolism and kidney function.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== SLC34A1 ===\nNo information available for gene SLC34A1",

This gene and its regulatory elements are linked to several GWAS traits:\n\n*   **Phosphatidylcholine 40:6 measurement (GWAS_EFO_0010389):** Suggests a potential role in lipid metabolism.\n*   **Behavioural disinhibition measurement (GWAS_EFO_0006946):** Indicates a possible association with behavioral traits, including impulsivity and risk-taking.\n*   **Response to vaccine (GWAS_EFO_0004645):** Points to a potential involvement in immune system response.\n*   **Cerebellum growth measurement (GWAS_EFO_0009327):** Suggests a role in cerebellar development.\n*   **Pathological myopia (GWAS_EFO_0004207):** Indicates a potential link to severe forms of myopia and associated complications.\n\nSeveral ChromHMM states are also associated with the \"response to vaccine\" GWAS trait, suggesting the variant might be located in regulatory regions influencing gene expression related to immune responses.\n\n### ClinVar Pathogenicity Summary and Associated Phenotypes:\n\nThe ClinVar database contains a substantial number of variants (14795) within the analyzed region, with a significant proportion classified as \"uncertain significance\" (6547). While there are pathogenic variants, the majority are benign.\n\nHowever, the **DNAH9 gene** is strongly associated with several phenotypes and diseases in ClinVar, particularly those related to **inborn genetic diseases** and **ciliary dyskinesia**. The most frequently reported phenotypes linked to non-benign variants in this region include:\n\n*   **DNAH9-related disorder:** This is a direct link to a specific genetic disorder.\n*   **Ciliary dyskinesia, primary, 40:** This is a significant finding, as ciliary dyskinesia is a condition affecting the function of cilia, which are present in various tissues, including the respiratory tract and reproductive system.\n*   **Inborn genetic diseases:** A broad category encompassing various inherited disorders.\n\nOther associated phenotypes include:\n\n*   **Sinoatrial node dysfunction and deafness**\n*   **Hydrocephalus**\n*   **Congenital heart disease**\n*   **Abnormal cardiovascular system morphology**\n*   **Schizophrenia**\n*   **Prostate cancer**\n*   **Breast ductal adenocarcinoma**\n*   **Non-immune hydrops fetalis**\n\n### Clues about Pathogenicity and Disease Relation:\n\nThe variant's \"uncertain significance\" classification in ClinVar, coupled with its low population frequency, warrants further investigation. The strong association of the **DNAH9 gene** with **DNAH9-related disorder** and **ciliary dyskinesia** in ClinVar is a significant clue. Given that DNAH9 is a component of dynein, which is crucial for ciliary function, variants in this gene are expected to impact ciliary motility.\n\nThe GWAS associations with **cerebellum growth** and **pathological myopia** could potentially be explained by the widespread role of cilia in development and tissue function. The association with **behavioural disinhibition** and **response to vaccine** might also be indirectly linked to broader cellular functions or developmental processes influenced by ciliary function or DNAH9.\n\nWhile the variant itself is of uncertain significance, its location within or near the **DNAH9 gene**, which is clearly implicated in **ciliary dyskinesia** and related **inborn genetic disorders**, raises concern. Further functional studies would be necessary to definitively determine the pathogenicity of this specific variant. However, the pattern of associated phenotypes strongly suggests a potential role in disorders affecting ciliary function and development.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== DNAH9 ===\nNo information available for gene DNAH9",

However, several factors suggest a potential role in pathogenicity:\n\n1.  **Association with Cognitive Function:** The presence of a GWAS association (GWAS_EFO_0008354) linking variants in the affected gene (UBR7) and its transcripts to **cognitive function measurement** is a significant clue. This suggests that alterations in this genetic region can impact cognitive abilities.\n2.  **ClinVar Phenotype Pattern:** The substantial number of non-benign variants in these entities associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders such as **Li-Campeau syndrome, Intellectual disability (mild and general), Galloway-Mowat syndrome, and Global developmental delay** strongly indicates a critical role for these genes in brain development and function.\n3.  **OMIM Status:** The \"OMIM: True\" annotation suggests that this genetic locus is linked to known human genetic disorders, further supporting its clinical relevance.\n4.  **High Proportion of Uncertain Significance Variants:** The overwhelming majority of variants in this locus within ClinVar are classified as \"uncertain significance\" (7181 out of 9622). This high number of variants with ambiguous clinical interpretation, coupled with the known disease associations, highlights the complexity of this region and the need for careful evaluation of individual variants.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the variant rs181764173 itself is classified as of uncertain significance, its location within genes and regulatory elements associated with cognitive function and a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders (including intellectual disability and various syndromes) warrants further investigation. The strong phenotypic pattern observed in ClinVar for other variants in this locus, combined with the GWAS association, suggests a potential for this variant to contribute to disease, particularly those affecting cognitive development. Further functional studies or segregation analysis would be beneficial to definitively determine its pathogenicity.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== UBR7 ===\nNo information available for gene UBR7",

Additionally, it is associated with ChromHMM states (IDs: 22904924, 19907992).\n\nThese genetic entities are associated with the following GWAS traits:\n\n*   **Iron Metabolism:**\n    *   Total iron binding capacity (GWAS_EFO_0006334)\n    *   Ferritin measurement (GWAS_EFO_0004459)\n    *   Transferrin saturation measurement (GWAS_EFO_0006333)\n    *   Serum iron measurement (GWAS_EFO_0006332) - This is particularly relevant as it's used in the diagnosis of familial hemochromatosis.\n*   **Red Blood Cell Distribution Width (GWAS_EFO_0005192)**\n\n### ClinVar Data and Phenotype Associations:\n\nThe ClinVar database contains a significant number of variants associated with the DUOX2 gene and its related regions. While the overall ClinVar landscape for this region includes a large proportion of benign variants, there are also numerous entries indicating pathogenic or uncertain significance.\n\nThe most prominent phenotypes and diseases associated with non-benign variants in this region are overwhelmingly related to **thyroid function and inborn genetic disorders**:\n\n*   **Thyroid Dyshormonogenesis 6:** This is the most frequently reported phenotype, appearing in various combinations with other terms.\n*   **Inborn Genetic Diseases:** A broad category that encompasses many of the specific thyroid-related conditions.\n*   **DUOX2-related disorder:** Directly implicates the DUOX2 gene in disease.\n*   **Congenital Hypothyroidism:** A common consequence of thyroid dyshormonogenesis.\n*   **Thyroglobulin Synthesis Defect:** Another specific defect in thyroid hormone production.\n*   **Familial Thyroid Dyshormonogenesis:** Suggests a hereditary component.\n*   **Genetic Transient Congenital Hypothyroidism:** A less severe form of congenital hypothyroidism.\n*   **Nongoitrous Euthyroid Hyperthyrotropinemia:** A condition characterized by elevated TSH levels without goiter or symptoms of hypothyroidism.\n\nLess frequently, but still notable, are associations with:\n\n*   **Idiopathic Basal Ganglia Calcification 1**\n*   **Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return**\n\n### Clues to Pathogenicity and Disease Relation:\n\nThe variant rs2467827 is annotated as **pathogenic** and **uncertain_significance** in ClinVar, and its ACMG classification is **Uncertain significance**. This suggests that while there is evidence pointing towards a pathogenic role, further investigation may be needed for definitive classification. The presence of OMIM data further supports a potential link to Mendelian disorders.\n\nThe strong association of variants within the DUOX2 gene and its regulatory regions with **thyroid dyshormonogenesis** and **congenital hypothyroidism** is a significant clue. DUOX2 is a key enzyme in thyroid hormone synthesis, and mutations in this gene are well-established causes of these conditions. The GWAS associations with various iron metabolism parameters, particularly serum iron measurement linked to familial hemochromatosis, suggest a potential secondary or pleiotropic effect of DUOX2 or related pathways on iron homeostasis, or that variants in this region might influence multiple biological processes.\n\nGiven the ClinVar annotations and the strong disease associations, particularly with thyroid-related disorders, this variant warrants further investigation for its potential role in causing or contributing to such conditions in the patient. The \"uncertain significance\" classification highlights the need for careful interpretation in the context of the patient's clinical presentation.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== DUOX2 ===\nNo information available for gene DUOX2",

                "description": "## Genomic Analysis Report: chr11:68917891G>T\n\nThis report details the analysis of the genomic variant chr11:68917891G>T (rs201147313) and its potential impact on associated genetic entities.\n\n### Variant Information:\n\n*   **Variant:** chr11:68917891G>T (rs201147313)\n*   **Gene:** IGHMBP2\n*   **ClinVar Significance:** The variant has been classified with mixed significance, including \"uncertain_significance\" and \"likely_benign\".\n*   **ACMG Classification:** Benign\n*   **Population Frequencies:** The variant is present at low frequencies in population databases (gnomAD Allele Frequency: 0.001184, gnomADg Allele Frequency: 0.000755, 1KG Frequency: 0.0004), suggesting it is not a common variant.\n\n### Genetic Entities and Associated Phenotypes:\n\nThe variant rs201147313 is located within or near the **IGHMBP2 gene** and several associated transcripts. This gene is also linked to various **ChromHMM states**.\n\n**GWAS Associations:**\n\nVariants within the genetic entities associated with rs201147313 have been linked to the following phenotypes through Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS):\n\n*   **Heel bone mineral density:** This suggests a potential role in skeletal health.\n*   **Body mass index (BMI):** This indicates a possible association with metabolic regulation and body composition.\n*   **High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol measurement:** This points to a potential influence on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk.\n\n**ClinVar Associations:**\n\nThe IGHMBP2 gene is strongly associated with a range of neurological disorders in ClinVar, particularly those affecting motor neurons and peripheral nerves. The most frequently reported conditions include:\n\n*   **Autosomal recessive distal spinal muscular atrophy 1 (SMA-P):** This is a severe neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy.\n*   **Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) and its subtypes, notably axonal type 2S:** CMT is a group of inherited disorders that affect the peripheral nerves, leading to muscle weakness, sensory loss, and deformities.\n*   **Inborn genetic diseases:** A broad category encompassing various inherited conditions.\n*   **Neuronopathy, distal hereditary motor, autosomal dominant:** Another type of motor neuron disease affecting the distal parts of the body.\n*   **IGHMBP2-related disorder:** This directly implicates the IGHMBP2 gene in a specific disorder.\n\nOther associated phenotypes include:\n\n*   **Distal spinal muscular atrophy**\n*   **Lower limb muscle weakness**\n*   **Difficulty walking**\n*   **Inability to walk**\n*   **Hammertoe**\n*   **Progressive muscle weakness**\n*   **Neurodevelopmental disorder**\n*   **Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4**\n*   **Spinal muscular atrophy**\n*   **Peripheral neuropathy**\n\n### Clues to Pathogenicity:\n\nWhile the variant rs201147313 itself has a mixed ClinVar significance and an ACMG classification of \"Benign,\" its association with the **IGHMBP2 gene** is highly significant. The IGHMBP2 gene is a well-established cause of severe neuromuscular disorders, including autosomal recessive distal spinal muscular atrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.\n\nThe presence of numerous pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in IGHMBP2 within ClinVar, strongly linked to these debilitating neurological conditions, raises a flag. Although rs201147313 is annotated as \"uncertain_significance\" or \"likely_benign,\" its location within a gene with such a clear disease association warrants careful consideration.\n\nThe GWAS associations with metabolic and skeletal traits (BMI, HDL cholesterol, bone density) are less directly related to the primary neurological phenotypes associated with IGHMBP2. However, these could represent pleiotropic effects of variants in this gene or indicate that other variants in the region influence these traits.\n\n**In summary:** The variant rs201147313 is located in the IGHMBP2 gene, which is critically involved in severe neuromuscular disorders. Despite its current benign or uncertain classification, the strong association of IGHMBP2 with conditions like spinal muscular atrophy and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease suggests that variants in this gene, including potentially rs201147313, could contribute to or be associated with these phenotypes. Further investigation into the functional impact of this specific variant on IGHMBP2 function would be beneficial.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== IGHMBP2 ===\nNo information available for gene IGHMBP2",
