                "description": "## chr6:26092913G>A Genomic Analysis Report\n\nThis report details the analysis of the variant chr6:26092913G>A (rs1800562) and its potential impact on associated genetic entities.\n\n### Variant Information:\n\n*   **rsID:** rs1800562\n*   **Chromosome:** 6\n*   **Position:** 26092913\n*   **Alleles:** G>A\n*   **Gene Names:** H2BC4, HFE\n*   **ClinVar Significance:** risk_factor, not_provided, pathogenic, pathogenic/pathogenic, low_penetrance\n*   **ACMG Classification:** Benign\n*   **gnomAD Allele Frequency:** 0.05903\n*   **1KG Frequency:** 0.0126\n\n**Note:** There is a discrepancy between the ClinVar significance indicating potential pathogenicity and the ACMG classification as Benign. The allele frequency in gnomAD and 1000 Genomes suggests this variant is relatively common in the population.\n\n### Genetic Entities and Associated GWAS Data:\n\nThe variant rs1800562 is located within or near several genetic entities, including the **HFE gene** and multiple **transcripts** and **TF binding sites** associated with it. These entities are implicated in a wide range of phenotypes through GWAS associations.\n\n**Key Phenotype Categories from GWAS:**\n\n*   **Metabolic and Cardiovascular Traits:** A significant number of GWAS associations relate to various blood lipid measurements (HDL, LDL, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B), blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, mean arterial pressure, pulse pressure), body composition (BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, body fat percentage, body fat distribution), and metabolic disorders like **diabetes mellitus** (including type II) and **hypertension**. Iron metabolism markers (serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity, hepcidin) are also strongly represented, aligning with the known function of the HFE gene.\n*   **Hematological Parameters:** Associations with red blood cell distribution width, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, erythrocyte count, platelet count, platelet crit, platelet component distribution width, and reticulocyte count are observed, suggesting a role in blood cell formation and function.\n*   **Neurological and Psychiatric Conditions:** Several associations point towards neurological and psychiatric phenotypes, including **schizophrenia**, **autism spectrum disorder**, **unipolar depression**, **anxiety**, **neuroticism**, and **cognitive function**.\n*   **Other Health-Related Traits:** Associations also extend to **smoking status**, **alcohol consumption**, **physical activity**, **educational attainment**, **obesity**, **allergic rhinitis**, **eczema**, **asthma**, **lung carcinoma**, **chronic kidney disease**, and **venous thromboembolism**.\n\n### ClinVar Information:\n\nThe ClinVar database shows a substantial number of variants within the analyzed entities, with a significant proportion classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic.\n\n**Key Phenotypes/Diseases Associated with Non-Benign Variants in ClinVar:**\n\nThe most prominent and frequently reported phenotype associated with non-benign variants in the analyzed entities is **hereditary hemochromatosis** and its subtypes (Hemochromatosis type 1, Juvenile hemochromatosis). This is consistently reported across a large number of variants.\n\nOther associated phenotypes include:\n\n*   **Inborn genetic diseases**\n*   **HFE-related disorder**\n*   **Bronze diabetes**\n*   **Cardiomyopathy**\n*   **Cutaneous photosensitivity**\n*   **Porphyrinuria**\n*   **Neuroendocrine neoplasm**\n*   **Alzheimer disease type 1**\n*   **Tessadori-Van Haaften neurodevelopmental syndromes**\n*   **Rahman syndrome**\n*   **Multiple myeloma**\n*   **Squamous cell lung carcinoma**\n*   **Breast ductal adenocarcinoma**\n*   **Doxorubicin response**\n*   **Neoplasm**\n*   **Global developmental delay**\n*   **Syndromic intellectual disability**\n*   **Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder**\n\n### Clues to Pathogenicity and Disease Association:\n\nThe variant rs1800562 is located in the **HFE gene**, which is well-established to be involved in **hereditary hemochromatosis**. The ClinVar data strongly supports this association, with a large number of pathogenic variants in this gene linked to hemochromatosis. The presence of \"pathogenic\" and \"risk_factor\" in the ClinVar significance for rs1800562 itself, despite the benign ACMG classification, warrants further investigation.\n\nThe broad range of GWAS associations, particularly those related to metabolic traits (iron metabolism, lipids, blood pressure, diabetes) and neurological/psychiatric conditions, suggests that the HFE gene and its regulatory regions may play a more complex role than solely iron overload. The commonality of this variant (indicated by gnomAD and 1KG frequencies) might suggest it acts as a modifier or contributes to risk in a polygenic manner for some of these conditions, rather than being a sole causative factor for severe Mendelian diseases.\n\n**In summary, the variant rs1800562 is strongly associated with hereditary hemochromatosis based on ClinVar data. The extensive GWAS associations with metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurological traits suggest a broader potential impact on health, possibly as a risk factor or modifier for these conditions.** The discrepancy between ClinVar and ACMG classifications highlights the need for careful interpretation and potentially further functional studies.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== HFE ===\nHFE Gene Biomedical Dossier\n### **HFE Gene Dossier**\n\n**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**\n*   **HGNC ID:** HFE\n*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 613609\n*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Hemochromatosis Type 1 (HFE1) [MIM:235200], Porphyria Variegata [MIM:176200], Microvascular Complications of Diabetes 7 [MIM:612635].\n*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between HFE variants and hereditary hemochromatosis is considered definitive.\n*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Primarily autosomal recessive with low clinical penetrance. Pseudodominance has been observed due to the high carrier frequency of p.Cys282Tyr in European populations.\n\n**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**\n*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v4 constraint metrics for HFE are pLI = 1.39e-11, LOEUF = 1.05, pRec = 0, and pNull = 1.\n*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A high pLI score (typically \u2265 0.9) suggests a gene is intolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The very low pLI and high LOEUF for HFE indicate that it is not constrained against LoF variants, which aligns with the recessive nature of the disease where heterozygotes are generally unaffected.\n*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Missense variants are the most common cause of HFE-related hemochromatosis. Nonsense, frameshift, and splice site variants have also been reported.\n\n**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**\n*   **Primary HPO terms:**\n    *   Elevated serum ferritin (HP:0003281)\n    *   Increased transferrin saturation (HP:0003155)\n    *   Hepatocellular carcinoma (HP:0001402)\n    *   Cirrhosis (HP:0001394)\n    *   Arthropathy (HP:0001369)\n    *   Hepatomegaly (HP:0002240)\n    *   Diabetes mellitus (HP:0000819)\n    *   Cardiomyopathy (HP:0001638)\n    *   Skin hyperpigmentation (HP:0000953)\n    *   Fatigue/Lethargy (HP:0012378, HP:0001947)\n    *   Abdominal pain (HP:0002027)\n*   **Secondary HPO terms:**\n    *   Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HP:0000044)\n    *   Alopecia (HP:0001596)\n    *   Hepatic steatosis (HP:0001397)\n    *   Fragile skin (HP:0001030)\n    *   Polycythemia vera (HP:0001897)\n    *   Intellectual disability (Rare) (HP:0001249)\n*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Clinical manifestations typically appear between 40 and 60 years of age in males and after menopause in females. Juvenile onset is rare and usually associated with other hemochromatosis genes.\n*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotypic spectrum is highly variable, ranging from non-penetrant (no clinical or biochemical signs), to biochemical (elevated iron markers without end-organ damage), to clinical HFE hemochromatosis with significant end-organ damage.\n\n**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**\n*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygosity for the p.Cys282Tyr missense variant is the most common genotype and is associated with the classic adult-onset hemochromatosis phenotype. Compound heterozygosity for p.Cys282Tyr and p.His63Asp can lead to a milder phenotype with elevated iron levels, but often without overt clinical disease.\n*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The p.Cys282Y mutation is located in the \u03b13 domain of the HFE protein and disrupts its interaction with beta-2 microglobulin, preventing its transport to the cell surface. The p.His63Asp variant is located in the \u03b11 domain and may have a lesser effect on protein function.\n*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is strong for the p.Cys282Y homozygous genotype leading to biochemical iron overload, but the clinical penetrance is low and variable. Other genetic and environmental factors modify the phenotype.\n*   **Examples: Specific Variants \u2192 Specific Phenotypes:**\n    *   p.Cys282Tyr homozygosity is strongly associated with increased serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, with a subset of individuals developing cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and diabetes.\n    *   p.Cys282Tyr/p.His63Asp compound heterozygosity is associated with a lower risk of hemochromatosis-related morbidity compared to p.Cys282Y homozygotes.\n\n**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**\n*   **rs1800562 / c.845G>A (p.Cys282Tyr) / Pathogenic (low penetrance):** Associated with Hemochromatosis Type 1, characterized by elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, with potential for liver disease, diabetes, and arthropathy. AF (gnomAD): ~3.7%\n*   **rs1799945 / c.187C>G (p.His63Asp) / VUS/Likely Benign:** When compounded with p.Cys282Y, may lead to mild hyperferritinemia. AF (gnomAD): ~8.6%.\n*   **rs146519482 / c.502G>T (p.Glu168Ter) / Pathogenic:** Causes loss of function and can lead to hemochromatosis, especially when compounded with p.Cys282Y. AF (gnomAD): Rare.\n*   **rs759524388 / c.211C>T (p.Arg71Ter) / Pathogenic:** A rare nonsense mutation associated with hemochromatosis. AF (gnomAD): Very rare.\n*   **rs573745685 / c.1006+1G>A / Pathogenic:** A splice site variant leading to loss of function and hemochromatosis. AF (gnomAD): Very rare.\n*   **rs765804978 / c.546_547del (p.Leu183fs) / Pathogenic:** A frameshift variant causing a truncated, non-functional protein. AF (gnomAD): Very rare.\n\n**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**\n*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** HFE is highly expressed in the liver and small intestine. This is consistent with its role in regulating iron absorption in the gut and iron storage in the liver.\n*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Liver dysfunction, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, is a primary phenotype due to iron accumulation. Pancreatic iron deposition can lead to diabetes.\n*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The age-related onset of symptoms is due to the progressive accumulation of iron over decades.\n\n**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**\n*   **Normal Gene Function:** The HFE protein interacts with the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) to regulate the uptake of iron into cells and is crucial for the normal regulation of hepcidin, the main hormone controlling iron metabolism.\n*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is loss-of-function due to mutations that impair the HFE protein's ability to reach the cell surface or bind to its partners. This leads to reduced hepcidin expression, causing increased intestinal iron absorption and iron overload in various organs.\n*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted \u2192 Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the HFE-TfR1 interaction and subsequent low hepcidin levels lead to increased activity of the iron exporter ferroportin on enterocytes and macrophages. This results in excessive iron loading in the plasma and deposition in tissues like the liver, heart, and pancreas, causing oxidative damage and organ dysfunction.\n*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The interaction of HFE with beta-2 microglobulin is essential for its proper cell surface localization. The interaction with TfR1 is key to its iron-sensing function, and it is thought to modulate the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway to regulate hepcidin.\n\n**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**\n*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** In individuals of Northern European descent with clinical signs of hemochromatosis, homozygosity for the p.Cys282Y mutation is found in about 80-90% of cases.\n*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Testing for HFE mutations is typically performed in individuals with elevated serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, or with a family history of hemochromatosis.\n*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Early diagnosis and treatment with therapeutic phlebotomy to remove excess iron can prevent organ damage and lead to a normal life expectancy.\n*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should address the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, the low and variable clinical penetrance of the p.Cys282Y homozygous genotype, and the lower risk associated with other genotypes like compound heterozygosity. Family screening can identify at-risk relatives.\n\n**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**\n*   **Feder JN, et al. (1996) Nat Genet. PMID: 8673096:** Landmark paper identifying the HFE gene as the cause of hereditary hemochromatosis.\n*   **Beutler E, et al. (2002) Lancet. PMID: 11812557:** A large population study demonstrating the low penetrance of HFE C282Y homozygosity.\n*   **Allen KJ, et al. (2008) N Engl J Med. PMID: 18184960:** A prospective study detailing the natural history and disease risk in HFE C282Y homozygotes, highlighting that severe iron-overload-related disease is relatively uncommon.\n*   **Ganz T. (2011) Blood. PMID: 21633120:** A review detailing the role of hepcidin in iron homeostasis and how its dysregulation in HFE hemochromatosis leads to disease.\n*   **Barton JC, et al. (2015) Gene.

Abstract 1088:** A large cohort study associating HFE p.Cys282Y homozygosity with phenotypes beyond iron overload, including polycythemia vera and lower cholesterol levels.\n*   **Powell LW, et al. (2024) Genet Med. PMID: 40034140:** A study using the All of Us research program data suggesting potential underdiagnosis and undertesting of HFE-related hemochromatosis in clinical practice.\n\n**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**\n*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Homozygosity for the p.Cys282Y variant (rs1800562) is strongly associated with elevated serum ferritin (HP:0003281) and increased transferrin saturation (HP:0003155).\n*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of elevated serum ferritin, increased transferrin saturation, and clinical features like arthropathy (especially of the metacarpophalangeal joints), liver disease, or skin hyperpigmentation strongly suggests pathogenic variants in the HFE gene.\n*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** Phenotypes of iron overload can also be caused by mutations in other genes, leading to different types of hemochromatosis such as HFE2 (Juvenile Hemochromatosis, due to HJV or HAMP mutations), HFE3 (TFR2 mutations), and HFE4 (SLC40A1 mutations), which should be considered in HFE-negative cases.\n\n",

While the ACMG classification is \"Uncertain significance,\" the \"likely_pathogenic\" designation from ClinVar, coupled with the variant's association with the ABCA4 gene, is highly significant.\n\nThe ABCA4 gene is well-established as a major contributor to various inherited retinal dystrophies. The overwhelming association of non-benign variants in ABCA4 with a spectrum of retinal disorders, including severe early-childhood-onset retinal dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy, and Stargardt disease, provides a strong link between this gene and the observed phenotypes.\n\nThe presence of GWAS associations for oral clefts (cleft lip and cleft palate) with genetic entities related to ABCA4 is noteworthy. While the primary association of ABCA4 is with retinal disorders, these GWAS findings suggest potential pleiotropic effects or shared genetic pathways that could influence craniofacial development.\n\n**In summary, the variant rs772735093, located in the ABCA4 gene and classified as likely_pathogenic in ClinVar, is strongly implicated in a range of retinal dystrophies. The GWAS data also suggests potential associations with oral clefts, warranting further investigation into the broader phenotypic spectrum that may be influenced by variants in this gene.**\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== ABCA4 ===\nNo information available for gene ABCA4",

Key associations include:\n\n*   **Auditory and Vestibular Function:**\n    *   **Age-related hearing impairment:** This is a significant finding, suggesting a potential role in age-associated hearing loss.\n    *   **Rare genetic deafness:** This directly points to a role in inherited forms of hearing loss.\n*   **Kidney Function:**\n    *   **Chronic kidney disease:** This indicates a potential link to kidney health.\n    *   **GFR change measurement:** Further supports a role in kidney function.\n*   **Neurological and Psychiatric Conditions:**\n    *   **Information processing speed:** Suggests a potential impact on cognitive function.\n    *   **Bipolar disorder:** Implicates the gene in mood disorders.\n    *   **Suicidal ideation:** A concerning association with mental health.\n    *   **Risk-taking behaviour:** Suggests a potential link to behavioral traits.\n    *   **Cingulate cortex measurement:** Indicates involvement in brain structure related to emotion and cognition.\n    *   **Beta-secretase 1 measurement:** May suggest a role in pathways related to Alzheimer's disease.\n*   **Metabolic and Inflammatory Conditions:**\n    *   **Body mass index:** Suggests a potential influence on weight regulation.\n    *   **Glucose metabolism decline measurement:** Indicates a possible role in metabolic health.\n    *   **Systemic lupus erythematosus:** Suggests a potential link to autoimmune diseases.\n*   **Pulmonary Function:**\n    *   **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD):** Indicates a potential association with lung health.\n    *   **Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide:** Further supports a role in lung function.\n    *   **FEV/FEC ratio:** Related to lung function measurements.\n*   **Hematological Parameters:**\n    *   **Red blood cell distribution width:** Suggests a potential impact on red blood cell characteristics.\n    *   **Leukocyte count, Lymphocyte percentage of leukocytes, Lymphocyte count, Monocyte count, Monocyte percentage of leukocytes, Neutrophil percentage of leukocytes, Neutrophil count, Myeloid white cell count:** These associations indicate a potential role in immune cell regulation and blood counts.\n*   **Other:**\n    *   **Protein measurement (general and blood protein):** Broad associations with protein levels.\n    *   **Progranulin measurement:** May be relevant to neurodegenerative pathways.\n    *   **Selective IgA deficiency disease:** Suggests a potential link to immune deficiencies.\n    *   **Smoking initiation:** Indicates a potential association with smoking behavior.\n    *   **Eye morphology measurement:** Suggests a potential role in ocular development or function.\n\n### ClinVar Annotations:\n\nClinVar data reveals that variants within the CDH23 gene are associated with a range of phenotypes, predominantly:\n\n*   **Hearing Impairment:** This is a highly recurrent theme, with numerous entries for **Autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss 12**, **Usher syndrome types 1 and 1D**, **Rare genetic deafness**, and **Hearing impairment**.\n*   **Retinal Dystrophy:** This is another prominent phenotype, often co-occurring with hearing loss in Usher syndrome.\n*   **Pituitary Adenoma:** Several entries link CDH23 variants to **Pituitary adenoma 5, multiple types**.\n*   **Inborn Genetic Diseases:** This is a broad category that encompasses many of the specific conditions listed.\n*   **Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome 19:** This indicates a potential role in neuromuscular disorders.\n*   **CDH23-related disorder:** This is a specific designation for disorders caused by variants in CDH23.\n\n### Clues to Pathogenicity and Disease Association:\n\nThe variant rs374362883 has an **\"uncertain significance\"** ClinVar classification and an **\"Uncertain significance\"** ACMG classification. This suggests that while it is not definitively benign, its pathogenic role is not yet established.\n\nHowever, several factors point towards a potential impact:\n\n1.  **Gene Function:** CDH23 is a known gene associated with hearing loss and Usher syndrome. The presence of numerous ClinVar entries for these conditions linked to variants in CDH23 strongly suggests its critical role in these pathways.\n2.  **Phenotypic Overlap:** The strong association of CDH23 with hearing loss and retinal dystrophy in ClinVar, coupled with GWAS findings related to hearing impairment and eye morphology, creates a compelling pattern.\n3.  **Rare Allele Frequency:** The low gnomAD allele frequency (0.0003231) indicates that this variant is rare in the general population, which is more consistent with a pathogenic or disease-associated variant than a common benign polymorphism.\n4.  **OMIM Association:** The \"OMIM: True\" flag suggests that the gene CDH23 is linked to known Mendelian disorders, further supporting its clinical relevance.\n\n**In summary, while rs374362883 is currently classified as uncertain significance, its location within the CDH23 gene, the known association of CDH23 with hearing loss and Usher syndrome, and its rarity in the population provide significant clues that this variant could be pathogenic and contribute to phenotypes such as hearing impairment and retinal dystrophy.** The association with pituitary adenoma also warrants consideration. Further functional studies or segregation analysis within affected families would be beneficial to definitively determine its pathogenicity.\n\n--- Gene Reports ---\n=== CDH23 ===\nNo information available for gene CDH23",
