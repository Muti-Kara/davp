CSPG4 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
– **HGNC ID**: 2466
– **OMIM Gene ID**: 601172
– **Primary Disease Associations**: Historically associated with melanoma progression and demyelinating diseases. A 2021 study identified a germline variant in individuals with a neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-like phenotype. Some variants of uncertain significance have been noted in individuals with schizophrenia.
– **Clinical Significance Level**: The evidence for its role in a Mendelian disorder is emerging. Its association with an NF1-like phenotype is currently supported by a single family study with functional data, suggesting a moderate level of evidence that requires further validation.
– **Inheritance Patterns**: The NF1-like phenotype associated with a *CSPG4* variant was observed in an autosomal dominant pattern.

### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
– **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics for *CSPG4* show a pLI score of 0.00, indicating it is not extremely intolerant to protein-truncating variants. The observed/expected (o/e) ratio for loss-of-function (LoF) variants is 1.03, with the 90% confidence interval of the o/e upper bound fraction (LOEUF) being 0.94-1.13. These values do not suggest haploinsufficiency.
– **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The low pLI and o/e ratio near 1.0 suggest that loss-of-function variants in *CSPG4* are generally tolerated in the population. This implies that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.
– **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Based on current evidence, pathogenic variants may not be simple loss-of-function. The identified germline variant associated with an NF1-like phenotype is a missense variant (V2097M) suggested to have a gain-of-function or dominant-negative effect by impairing ectodomain cleavage.

### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
– **Primary HPO terms**: Based on the reported NF1-like phenotype, primary terms would include:
    – Café-au-lait spot (HP:0000957)
    - Neurofibroma (HP:0001067)
    - Axillary freckling (HP:0000997)
    - Inguinal freckling (HP:0001050)
– **Secondary HPO terms**:
    – Lisch nodule (HP:0000593)
    – Macrocephaly (HP:0000256)
    – Learning disability (HP:0001249)
– **Age of Onset Patterns**: The NF1-like features were documented in both children and adults within the affected family, suggesting a childhood onset.
– **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: The reported NF1-like phenotype was described as "mild".

### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
– **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: A missense variant in the D3 extracellular subdomain has been linked to an NF1-like syndrome. The functional consequence appears to be altered protein processing rather than simple loss of function.
– **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: The V2097M variant is located near a putative proteolytic cleavage site in the D3 domain of the extracellular portion of the protein. This location is critical, as impaired cleavage is proposed to enhance signaling.
– **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: Currently weak, as it is based on a single family report.
– **Examples: Specific Variants → Specific Phenotypes**:
    – **c.6289G>A (p.Val2097Met)**: Associated with multiple café-au-lait macules, axillary and inguinal freckling, and cutaneous neurofibromas (NF1-like phenotype).

### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
– **Up to 15 well-characterized pathogenic variants**: Currently, only one germline variant has been described with significant evidence for pathogenicity in a Mendelian context. Variants listed in ClinVar are predominantly of uncertain significance.
– **Format: rsID / HGVS / ClinVar significance / Reported phenotypes (HPO terms) / AF**:
    – **rsID not provided / c.6289G>A (p.Val2097Met) / Pathogenic (per publication) / Café-au-lait spot, Axillary freckling, Inguinal freckling, Neurofibroma / Not reported in gnomAD.**
– **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence**: The p.Val2097Met variant has the strongest evidence, supported by co-segregation in a family and in vitro functional studies.
– **Novel Variants from Recent Case Reports**: The p.Val2097Met variant was reported in 2021 and represents the first and only germline mutation in *CSPG4* linked to a human Mendelian disease to date.

### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
– **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM)**: According to GTEx data, *CSPG4* shows the highest expression in arteries (tibial, aorta, coronary), tibial nerve, and adrenal gland. It is also expressed in skin.
– **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: Expression in skin is consistent with the observed café-au-lait macules and neurofibromas. Expression in the nervous system and arteries aligns with its proposed roles in neural development and angiogenesis.
– **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: The gene product, NG2, is a known marker for oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and is involved in their development. Its expression is also noted in mesenchymal chondroblasts during endochondral ossification. This developmental role may be relevant to the skeletal features sometimes seen in NF1, although not explicitly reported in the *CSPG4*-related family.

### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
– **Normal Gene Function**: *CSPG4* encodes a large transmembrane chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (also known as NG2) that functions as a co-receptor, modulating cell proliferation, migration, and signaling by interacting with growth factors, integrins, and the extracellular matrix.
– **Disease Mechanism**: The identified V2097M variant appears to cause disease through a gain-of-function mechanism. The mutation hinders proteolytic cleavage of the ectodomain, leading to increased stability of the full-length protein at the cell surface and subsequent hyperactivation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.
– **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences**: Disruption of the normal, regulated cleavage of CSPG4 leads to over-activity of the RAS/MAPK pathway, which is a well-established driver of cell proliferation and is the same pathway dysregulated by mutations in the *NF1* gene. This results in the characteristic growth-related phenotypes like café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas.
– **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: CSPG4 interacts with multiple partners, including integrins and growth factor receptors, to mediate its effects. Its ability to potentiate MAPK/ERK signaling is central to the observed NF1-like phenotype.

### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
– **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: The diagnostic yield is currently unknown and likely very low. *CSPG4* is not a standard gene on panels for Noonan syndrome or NF1. The only reported cases were identified through a combination of targeted sequencing and whole-exome sequencing in a family with an NF1-like phenotype that was negative for *NF1* and *SPRED1* mutations.
– **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: Testing for *CSPG4* would be considered in individuals with a clinical diagnosis of an NF1-like syndrome, particularly familial cases where testing for known NF1-spectrum genes is negative.
– **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: If a pathogenic *CSPG4* variant is confirmed, management would likely mirror that for individuals with NF1, including regular monitoring for neurofibromas, ophthalmologic exams, and developmental assessments.
– **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling would involve discussing the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and the potential for variable expressivity, similar to NF1. Given the limited data, predicting the full phenotypic spectrum and long-term risks is challenging.

### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
– **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**:
    – The missense variant **p.Val2097Met** is strongly associated with a phenotype that includes: **Café-au-lait spot (HP:0000957)**, **Axillary freckling (HP:0000997)**, and **Neurofibroma (HP:0001067)**.
– **Phenotype red flags**:
    – The presence of multiple café-au-lait spots with or without other features of neurofibromatosis in a patient who has tested negative for mutations in *NF1* and other RASopathy-associated genes should raise suspicion for a *CSPG4* variant.
– **Differential diagnosis considerations**:
    – The primary differential diagnosis is **Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)**, caused by mutations in the *NF1* gene.
    – **Legius syndrome**, caused by mutations in *SPRED1*, also presents with multiple café-au-lait spots but typically lacks neurofibromas and Lisch nodules.
    – Other RASopathies with cutaneous findings could also be considered in the differential.
