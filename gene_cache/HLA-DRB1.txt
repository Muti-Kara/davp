HLA-DRB1 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Dossier: HLA-DRB1**

**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** 4948.
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 142857.
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** HLA-DRB1 is primarily associated with susceptibility to a wide range of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sarcoidosis, and type 1 diabetes. It is also a critical gene in the context of organ transplantation.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Definitive evidence for its role in numerous autoimmune conditions.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The inheritance pattern is complex; it doesn't follow a simple Mendelian pattern for disease susceptibility. Instead, specific alleles act as risk factors, increasing the likelihood of developing a disease, often in combination with other genetic and environmental factors.

**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v4.0 database does not provide standard constraint metrics like pLI and LOEUF for HLA genes due to their high polymorphism. The extreme allelic diversity is a core feature of their function, not a sign of intolerance to variation in the typical sense.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The lack of traditional constraint scores reflects the gene's function; its variability is essential for recognizing a wide array of foreign peptides. Therefore, pathogenicity is not typically due to loss-of-function but rather to specific alleles conferring altered immune responses.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Specific missense variants (alleles) are the primary drivers of disease association. Stop-gain and frameshift variants can have a high impact, potentially leading to loss of function, though this is less commonly the mechanism of disease compared to specific allele effects.

    *   HP:0010535 Pancolitis
    *   HP:0012378 Recurrent pregnancy loss
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The age of onset varies significantly depending on the associated disease. For example, in multiple sclerosis, HLA-DRB1*15:01 is associated with a younger age of onset (around 32.4 years). For other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, it can manifest in adulthood.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of phenotypes is also allele- and disease-dependent. In multiple sclerosis, the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele is associated with increased disease severity, including a higher volume of white matter lesions and cognitive impairments. Conversely, alleles like HLA-DRB1*04:05 in Japanese MS patients can be associated with a milder course.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific missense variants, which define the different HLA-DRB1 alleles, are strongly correlated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. For instance, the 'shared epitope' alleles (e.g., *04:01, *04:04) are strongly linked to rheumatoid arthritis.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Variations in exon 2, which encodes the peptide-binding groove (specifically the third hypervariable region), are critical in determining T-cell recognition and are strongly associated with disease susceptibility.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between specific HLA-DRB1 alleles and autoimmune disease susceptibility is generally strong, although the presence of a risk allele does not guarantee disease development.
*   **Examples: Specific Variants → Specific Phenotypes:**
    *   **HLA-DRB1*15:01:** Strong association with multiple sclerosis, particularly in populations of Northern European descent. This allele is also linked to a younger age of onset and increased disease severity in MS.
    *   **HLA-DRB1*04 alleles (Shared Epitope):** Associated with increased risk and severity of rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in individuals positive for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA).
    *   **HLA-DRB1*03:01:** Linked to an increased risk for systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, and sarcoidosis.
    *   **HLA-DRB1*13:02:** Appears to have a protective effect against severe rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.

**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   This section is challenging for HLA-DRB1 as "pathogenic variants" are typically entire alleles rather than single nucleotide variants. Alleles are defined by a combination of variants.
    *   **Allele: DRB1*15:01:**
        *   **Significance:** Risk allele for Multiple Sclerosis.
        *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Multiple sclerosis (HP:0001337), Optic neuritis (HP:0002061), Cerebellar ataxia (HP:0001269), Cognitive impairment (HP:0002093).
    *   **Allele: DRB1*04:01:**
        *   **Significance:** Risk allele for Rheumatoid Arthritis.
        *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Rheumatoid arthritis (HP:0000928), Arthritis (HP:0002829), Autoantibody positivity (HP:0002715).
    *   **Allele: DRB1*03:01:**
        *   **Significance:** Risk allele for Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Sarcoidosis.
        *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Type I diabetes mellitus (HP:0004940), Systemic lupus erythematosus (HP:0002728), Sarcoidosis (HP:0100242), Recurrent pregnancy loss (HP:0012378).
    *   **Allele: DRB1*08:02:**
        *   **Significance:** Risk allele for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD).
        *   **Reported Phenotypes:** Optic neuritis (HP:0002061), Myelitis (HP:0012623).

**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** Highest expression is found in immune cells, particularly B-cells and dendritic cells. Significant expression is also seen in the spleen, lymph nodes, and whole blood.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in antigen-presenting cells directly correlates with its central role in immunity and the development of autoimmune disorders affecting various tissues targeted by the immune system. For example, high expression in immune cells infiltrating the central nervous system contributes to multiple sclerosis.
*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Expression is critical throughout life for a functional adaptive immune system. Age-related changes in the immune system (immunosenescence) can interact with HLA-DRB1-associated risks to influence the onset or severity of autoimmune diseases in later life.

**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** The HLA-DRB1 protein is a beta chain of the MHC class II molecule, which presents peptides derived from extracellular proteins to CD4+ T-helper cells, initiating an adaptive immune response.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary disease mechanism is not haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative in the traditional sense. Instead, specific alleles (gain-of-function in a sense) have altered peptide-binding grooves that may preferentially present self-antigens or fail to present them for proper T-cell tolerance, leading to autoimmunity.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences:** The gene is central to the "Antigen processing and presentation" pathway. Dysregulation of this pathway by specific HLA-DRB1 alleles leads to the activation of self-reactive T-cells, which in turn drive inflammation and tissue damage in target organs, resulting in the clinical phenotypes of autoimmune diseases like joint destruction in RA or demyelination in MS.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** HLA-DRB1 forms a heterodimer with HLA-DRA to create the functional MHC class II molecule. Its interaction with the T-cell receptor is the critical step in T-cell activation, and variations in this interaction due to different HLA-DRB1 alleles are fundamental to disease pathogenesis.

**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** HLA-DRB1 typing is not diagnostic on its own but provides a risk assessment. For example, in individuals with suspected MS, the presence of HLA-DRB1*15:01 increases the likelihood of the diagnosis and can have prognostic value. In rheumatoid arthritis, the presence of shared-epitope alleles supports the diagnosis, especially in ACPA-positive patients.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is commonly performed for histocompatibility matching in organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is also used in the diagnostic workup of certain autoimmune diseases like MS, celiac disease (indirectly through linkage with DQ genes), and for prognostic stratification in RA.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Knowledge of a patient's HLA-DRB1 status can influence clinical management. For instance, in RA, patients with shared-epitope alleles may be considered for more aggressive early treatment strategies. It may also be a factor in selecting therapies that target specific immune pathways.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should emphasize that HLA-DRB1 alleles are risk factors, not deterministic causes of disease. The inheritance is complex, and the risk to family members is influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. The concept of "susceptibility" versus "causality" is a key point to convey.

**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**
    *   **HLA-DRB1*15:01:** Strongly associated with phenotypes of multiple sclerosis, including Optic neuritis (HP:0002061), Cerebellar ataxia (HP:0001269), Spasticity (HP:0002376), and Cognitive impairment (HP:0002093).
    *   **HLA-DRB1 Shared Epitope alleles (e.g., *04:01, *04:04):** High confidence association with Rheumatoid arthritis (HP:0000928) and related features like Autoantibody positivity (HP:0002715).
    *   **HLA-DRB1*03:01:** Strongly linked to phenotypes of systemic autoimmune diseases, including Systemic lupus erythematosus (HP:0002728) and Type I diabetes mellitus (HP:0004940).
*   **Phenotype red flags:**
    *   A combination of central nervous system demyelinating features (e.g., Optic neuritis, Myelitis) in a young adult of European ancestry strongly suggests investigating for the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele.
    *   The presence of severe, symmetric, erosive polyarthritis, particularly with positive ACPA and rheumatoid factor, is a strong indicator for the presence of HLA-DRB1 shared-epitope alleles.
*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotypes associated with HLA-DRB1 alleles, such as arthritis, optic neuritis, and general autoimmunity, have a very broad differential diagnosis. Many other genes are involved in monogenic and polygenic forms of these diseases. Therefore, HLA-DRB1 status must be interpreted in the full clinical context and alongside other genetic and serological tests. For example, the phenotype of neuromyelitis optica, which overlaps with MS, has a different primary HLA association (e.g., DRB1*08:02) and is often distinguished by the presence of anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies.
