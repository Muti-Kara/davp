POTEM Gene Biomedical Dossier
This clinical genetics dossier for the human gene POTEM has been compiled based on the available web search results.

### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** 37096.
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** There is no OMIM entry specifically for the POTEM gene itself.
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Currently, there are no definitive disease associations for POTEM listed in major clinical databases like OMIM. GeneCards mentions associations with Glycogen Storage Disease III and Prostate Cancer, but these are not well-established in clinical genetic literature.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of POTEM is currently uncertain, with no definitive evidence linking it to a Mendelian disorder.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No specific inheritance patterns have been established due to the lack of a defined disease association.

### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** As of the latest gnomAD data, specific constraint metrics for POTEM are not readily available or are not highlighted in the search results. A deep dive into the gnomAD browser would be required for precise values. The gnomAD constraint metrics, such as pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) and LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction), are crucial for interpreting gene function.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** A high pLI (close to 1) or a low LOEUF score would suggest that the gene is intolerant to loss-of-function variants and that such variants could be pathogenic. Without the specific scores for POTEM, a definitive interpretation is not possible.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** For genes intolerant to loss-of-function, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants are most likely to be pathogenic. The pathogenicity of missense variants would depend on their location and predicted effect on protein function.

### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are definitively associated with POTEM in the search results.
*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are documented in the search results.
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Information regarding the age of onset is not available as no specific disease is linked to POTEM.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Information on phenotype severity is not available.

### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Due to the absence of a known disease association, there are no established correlations between variant classes and specific phenotypes for POTEM.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** The POTEM protein contains ankyrin repeats, which are known to mediate protein-protein interactions. Variants within this domain could potentially disrupt these interactions, but specific phenotype patterns are not known.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlation is currently unknown.
*   **Examples: Specific Variants → Specific Phenotypes:** No such examples are available in the search results.

### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   No well-characterized pathogenic variants for POTEM are listed in the ClinVar search results with associated phenotypes. A detailed search of the ClinVar database directly might yield more information.

### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** A study on human fetal development showed POTEM expression in various tissues between 10 and 20 weeks of gestation. The GTEx project provides extensive data on gene expression across multiple tissues, which can suggest which organs might be affected by variants. However, specific expression data for POTEM and its clinical correlation were not detailed in the provided search results.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Without defined disease associations, it is difficult to predict tissue-specific phenotypes.
*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The expression in fetal tissues suggests a potential role in development.

### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** POTEM is a protein-coding gene, and the presence of ankyrin repeats suggests a role in protein-protein interactions.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is unknown. For a gene intolerant to loss-of-function variants, haploinsufficiency would be a likely mechanism.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences:** The specific pathways involving POTEM are not well-defined in the search results.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The ankyrin repeats are expected to mediate protein-protein interactions, but specific partners and their relevance to a potential phenotype are not known.

### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for POTEM is currently zero, as it is not associated with a known disease.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** This gene is not routinely tested in a clinical setting.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are no known clinical actionability or management implications.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the lack of information, genetic counseling would be challenging. If a variant of uncertain significance is identified, counseling would focus on the uncertainty and the lack of evidence for pathogenicity.

### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   The search results did not yield specific publications detailing clinical phenotypes associated with variants in POTEM. The literature found was generally related to the Human Phenotype Ontology, GTEx, gnomAD, and genotype-phenotype correlations in other diseases.

### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** There are currently no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for POTEM.
*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are no known "red flag" phenotypes that would strongly suggest pathogenic variants in POTEM.
*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** As there is no defined phenotype, differential diagnosis considerations are not applicable.
