GOLGA6L9 Gene Biomedical Dossier
**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   HGNC ID: HGNC:24514.
*   OMIM gene ID: This gene does not have an OMIM number.
*   Primary disease associations: No established disease associations have been documented in OMIM or other major clinical genetics databases.
*   Clinical significance level: Evidence for a role in human disease is currently preliminary or absent.
*   Inheritance patterns observed in patients: No specific inheritance patterns have been described due to the lack of identified disease associations.

**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   pLI: 0.00.
*   LOEUF: 1.34.
*   pRec: 0.74.
*   pNull: 0.22.
*   Clinical interpretation of constraint scores: The very low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that the gene is not intolerant to loss-of-function variation.
*   Variant classes most likely to be pathogenic: Due to the lack of disease association, there is no information on which variant classes are more likely to be pathogenic.

**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms**: No HPO terms are currently associated with GOLGA6L9 in the Human Phenotype Ontology database.
*   **Secondary HPO terms**: There are no documented secondary HPO terms.
*   Age of onset patterns: No information is available regarding the age of onset for any potential GOLGA6L9-related disorders.
*   Phenotype severity spectrum: The spectrum of phenotype severity is unknown.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   Variant classes and their typical phenotypes: No genotype-phenotype correlations have been established.
*   Protein domain-specific phenotype patterns: No protein domain-specific phenotype patterns have been identified.
*   Genotype-phenotype correlation strength: The genotype-phenotype correlation is currently unknown.
*   Examples: specific variants → specific phenotypes: There are no reported examples of specific variants leading to specific phenotypes.

**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   No well-characterized pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are listed in ClinVar for GOLGA6L9.

**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   Highest expressing tissues (GTEx TPM) and clinical correlation: According to the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) portal, GOLGA6L9 shows the highest expression in the testis. The clinical relevance of this expression pattern is unknown.
*   Tissue-specific phenotypes expected: Given the high expression in the testis, one might hypothesize a role in male fertility, but no such association has been proven.
*   Expression during development and age-related phenotypes: Information on developmental expression patterns and their relation to age-related phenotypes is not available.

**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   Normal gene function in one sentence: GOLGA6L9 is predicted to be a golgin protein, likely involved in the structure and function of the Golgi apparatus.
*   Disease mechanism: No disease mechanism has been described for GOLGA6L9.
*   Cellular/molecular pathways disrupted → phenotype consequences: No information exists on how disruption of GOLGA6L9 would lead to specific phenotypes.
*   Protein-protein interactions relevant to phenotype: No specific protein-protein interactions with known phenotypic relevance have been documented.

**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   Diagnostic yield in clinical cohorts: The diagnostic yield for GOLGA6L9 in clinical cohorts is unknown, as it is not typically included in standard diagnostic gene panels.
*   Most common reasons for testing this gene: There are currently no common clinical reasons for testing GOLGA6L9.
*   Clinical actionability and management implications: There is no known clinical actionability associated with variants in this gene.
*   Genetic counseling considerations: Due to the lack of a known disease association, genetic counseling would focus on the uncertainty of any findings in this gene.

**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   A comprehensive search of PubMed and other literature databases did not reveal any publications that establish a clear genotype-phenotype correlation for GOLGA6L9.

**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: There are no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for GOLGA6L9.
*   **Phenotype red flags**: There are no known "red flag" phenotypes that would strongly suggest pathogenic variants in this gene.
*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**: Due to the lack of an associated phenotype, there are no specific genes to consider in a differential diagnosis.
