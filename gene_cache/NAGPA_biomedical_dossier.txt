NAGPA Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Dossier: NAGPA**

**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** 17378
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 607985
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Stuttering, Articulation Disorder, and potential association with Kawasaki disease and IgA vasculitis.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for a role in stuttering is emerging, while the association with vasculitides is more recent. The clinical significance for a Mendelian disorder is not yet definitively established.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Variants associated with stuttering appear to have a complex inheritance pattern, with some studies suggesting a role for heterozygous variants, while others have investigated recessive modes.

**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:**
    *   pLI (probability of being Loss-of-function Intolerant) is not high, suggesting the gene is not under strong constraint against heterozygous loss-of-function variants.
    *   The Loss-of-function Observed/Expected Upper-bound Fraction (LOEUF) score provides a continuous measure of intolerance to inactivation. A low LOEUF score indicates intolerance to loss-of-function variation.
    *   pRec and pNull scores help to distinguish between recessive and null models of disease.
*   **Clinical Interpretation:** A low pLI and a LOEUF score not in the most constrained deciles suggest that simple haploinsufficiency is unlikely to be a common disease mechanism. This is consistent with the complex genetics of stuttering.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Missense and potentially regulatory variants have been implicated in stuttering and other associated conditions. The role of truncating variants is less clear.

**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:**
    *   Stuttering (HP:0011559)
    *   Articulation disorder (HP:0001260)
*   **Secondary HPO terms:**
    *   Developmental dyslexia (HP:0001332) has been associated with a SNP in *NAGPA*.
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Stuttering typically has a childhood onset.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity of stuttering can be variable. One study noted that individuals with mutations in *NAGPA* and other related genes had less resolution of stuttering symptoms after therapy.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Missense variants have been most frequently associated with stuttering. An intronic variant, rs3743841, has been linked to Kawasaki disease and IgA vasculitis, likely acting as a regulatory variant.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Specific residues within a highly conserved surface cavity of the NAGPA enzyme are essential for its function.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is currently considered moderate to weak for stuttering, given the complex and likely polygenic nature of the disorder.
*   **Examples: specific variants → specific phenotypes:** The SNP rs882294 in *NAGPA* has shown a significant association with developmental dyslexia in a Chinese population. The intronic variant rs3743841 is associated with an increased risk for Kawasaki disease and IgA vasculitis.

**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   At present, there are no specific pathogenic variants in *NAGPA* listed in ClinVar with extensive evidence for causing a monogenic disorder. Most of the reported associations are with common variants (SNPs) and complex traits.
*   A study on non-syndromic stuttering in Iranian families identified variations in *NAGPA*, but did not pinpoint a single causative pathogenic variant with high confidence.

**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project provides data on gene expression across multiple tissues, which can help to understand the potential tissue-specific effects of variants. *NAGPA* is expressed in various tissues, and its role in the brain is of particular interest for stuttering.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given the association with stuttering and developmental dyslexia, variants affecting *NAGPA* function in the brain are most likely to be clinically relevant for these phenotypes.
*   **Expression During Development:** Expression patterns during brain development are particularly relevant for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders like stuttering.

**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** *NAGPA* encodes the N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase, also known as the "uncovering enzyme," which is the second step in creating the mannose-6-phosphate tag on lysosomal enzymes, essential for their transport to the lysosome.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** The exact mechanism by which *NAGPA* variants contribute to stuttering is not fully understood but is thought to involve subtle disruptions in the lysosomal targeting pathway. For the association with vasculitides, the proposed mechanism is altered gene regulation.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of the mannose-6-phosphate pathway can affect the function of multiple lysosomal enzymes. The genes *GNPTAB*, *GNPTG*, and *NAGPA* all function in this pathway, and variants in all three have been linked to stuttering. This suggests a shared biological mechanism for this speech disorder.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** *NAGPA* has been shown to interact with *AP4E1* in a yeast-two-hybrid system, a gene also implicated in stuttering.

**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield of sequencing *NAGPA* for stuttering is currently low and not standard clinical practice.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is primarily done in a research context to investigate the genetic basis of stuttering.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** At present, there are no direct clinical actions based on *NAGPA* genotype. However, one study suggested that individuals with mutations in this pathway might have a poorer response to speech therapy.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the complex inheritance and incomplete penetrance, genetic counseling for *NAGPA*-associated stuttering should emphasize the multifactorial nature of the condition.

**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   **Kang C, Drayna D. (2011) *Genetics of stuttering.*** Established the initial link between genes in the lysosomal enzyme targeting pathway and stuttering. [Referenced in 12]
*   **Raza, M. H., et al. (2018) *Variants in GNPTAB, GNPTG and NAGPA genes are associated with stutterers.*** This study in Iranian families provided further support for the involvement of these genes in non-syndromic stuttering.
*   **Carmona-Sáez, P., et al. (2022) *Identification of a shared genetic risk locus for Kawasaki disease and immunoglobulin A vasculitis by a cross-phenotype meta-analysis.*** Identified a novel association between a regulatory variant in *NAGPA* and two childhood vasculitides.
*   **Frigerio-Domingues, C., et al. (2024) *De novo protein-coding gene variants in developmental stuttering.*** A recent study that further explores the genetic architecture of stuttering, mentioning the role of *NAGPA* in the context of other implicated genes.
*   **Zhu, Y., et al. (2015) *Association study of GNPTAB, GNPTG, and NAGPA variants with developmental dyslexia in a Chinese population.*** This study identified an association between a *NAGPA* SNP and developmental dyslexia.

**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence single variant to phenotype associations for *NAGPA* that would be used for definitive diagnosis of a monogenic disorder.
*   **Phenotype red flags:** The presence of stuttering (HP:0011559) or an articulation disorder (HP:0001260) in a patient, especially with a family history of the same, may suggest that variants in *NAGPA* and related genes (*GNPTAB*, *GNPTG*) could be a contributing factor.
*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of stuttering can have significant overlap with other neurodevelopmental disorders. Genes involved in the same lysosomal targeting pathway (*GNPTAB* and *GNPTG*) should be considered, as severe, recessive mutations in these genes cause mucolipidosis II and III, which are distinct, severe lysosomal storage disorders.
