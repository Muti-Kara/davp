ZAR1 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** 13197.
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 610078.
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Zygote Arrest 1 is associated with Oocyte Maturation Defect 8 (OOMD8; OMIM #619227).
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The association between biallelic *ZAR1* variants and OOMD8 is supported by multiple case reports and is considered definitive for this specific phenotype.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** The observed inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive.

### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **gnomAD v4.0 Constraint:** pLI = 0.00; LOEUF = 1.13; pRec = 0.59.
*   **Clinical Interpretation:** The very low pLI and high LOEUF score indicate that the gene is tolerant of heterozygous loss-of-function (LoF) variants, which is consistent with its recessive mode of inheritance. The pRec score of 0.59 provides moderate statistical evidence for a recessive disease mechanism.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Biallelic (homozygous or compound heterozygous) nonsense, frameshift, and missense variants located in critical functional domains have been reported as pathogenic.

### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:**
    *   Female infertility (HP:0000789)
    *   Oocyte maturation arrest (HP:0010475)
    *   Primary ovarian insufficiency (HP:0008209)
    *   Arrested oocyte development (HP:0040183)
    *   Failure of fertilization (HP:0040184)
    *   Early embryonic arrest
    *   Abnormal zygote morphology
*   **Secondary HPO terms:**
    *   Abnormal oocyte morphology
    *   Failure to extrude first polar body
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The phenotype manifests during adulthood in females attempting to conceive.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Severity is consistently severe, typically leading to complete infertility due to oocyte maturation failure, failed fertilization, or early embryonic demise.

### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Biallelic loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site) and critical missense variants consistently lead to female infertility due to defects in oocyte maturation and the oocyte-to-embryo transition.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Pathogenic variants have been identified in the ZAR1-N domain and the C-terminal CxxC-type zinc-finger domain, which is essential for RNA binding. Disruption of either domain impairs protein function.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between biallelic pathogenic *ZAR1* variants and the OOMD8 phenotype is strong.

### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   Pathogenic variants are reported in ClinVar associated with autosomal recessive Oocyte Maturation Defect 8. Examples include:
    *   **HGVS:** NM_145025.3:c.865C>T / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Reported Phenotypes:** Oocyte maturation defect 8
    *   **HGVS:** NM_145025.3:c.319C>T / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Reported Phenotypes:** Oocyte maturation defect 8
    *   **HGVS:** NM_145025.3:c.995_996del / **Significance:** Pathogenic / **Reported Phenotypes:** Oocyte maturation defect 8
    *   **HGVS:** NM_145025.3:c.101C>G / **Significance:** Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic / **Reported Phenotypes:** Oocyte maturation defect 8

### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx):** Expression is highly specific to the **Ovary**, with significant expression also in the **Testis**.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The high expression in the ovary directly correlates with the observed phenotype of female infertility due to oocyte defects. While expressed in the testis, no male infertility phenotype has been definitively linked to *ZAR1* variants in humans to date.
*   **Expression During Development:** *Zar1* is a maternal-effect gene, meaning its mRNA is transcribed and stored in the growing oocyte and is essential for the earliest stages of embryonic development before zygotic genome activation.

### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** ZAR1 is an RNA-binding protein that plays a critical role in oocyte maturation and the maternal-to-zygotic transition by binding to and regulating the translation of maternal mRNAs.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism is loss-of-function. Biallelic pathogenic variants lead to a non-functional ZAR1 protein, which disrupts the normal translational regulation of essential maternal transcripts.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** Disruption of ZAR1 function impairs the translational activation of key maternal mRNAs required for meiotic cell cycle progression, spindle formation, and polar body extrusion, leading to oocyte maturation arrest.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** ZAR1 and its homolog ZAR2 function in concert to orchestrate the dynamics of maternal mRNA polyadenylation and translational activation.

### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield:** The diagnostic yield is highest in cohorts of women with a specific history of recurrent oocyte maturation arrest, especially arrest at the Germinal Vesicle (GV) or Metaphase I (MI) stage.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** This gene is tested as part of gene panels for female infertility, primary ovarian insufficiency, and recurrent fertilization failure or early embryonic arrest.
*   **Clinical Actionability:** A definitive diagnosis can guide reproductive counseling, informing patients about the low probability of success with conventional IVF and the potential option of oocyte donation.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling should focus on the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, the 25% recurrence risk for future pregnancies in carrier parents, and the option of carrier screening for the partner and relevant family members.

### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   **PMID: 33795393 (2021):** Described biallelic loss-of-function variants in *ZAR1* causing human oocyte maturation arrest and female infertility, establishing the first link between *ZAR1* and human disease.
*   **PMID: 34182455 (2021):** Further confirmed *ZAR1* as a pathogenic gene for human early embryonic lethality and oocyte maturation defects, expanding the mutational and phenotypic spectrum.
*   **PMID: 31600778 (2019):** A study in mice demonstrating the redundant function of *Zar1* and *Zar2* in regulating oocyte meiotic maturation and translational activation of maternal mRNAs.
*   **PMID: 12447348 (2002):** The landmark study in mice that first identified *Zar1* as a maternal-effect gene essential for the oocyte-to-embryo transition.
*   **PMID: 36005748 (2022):** A study on mouse *Zar1/2* that characterized ZAR1 as an RNA-binding protein that stabilizes maternal transcripts by binding to their 3' UTR.

### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** Biallelic loss-of-function or pathogenic missense variants in *ZAR1* are strongly associated with **Oocyte maturation arrest (HP:0010475)** and **Female infertility (HP:0000789)**.
*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** A clinical history of recurrent failed IVF cycles characterized by a high proportion of immature oocytes (GV or MI stage), failed fertilization, or cleavage-stage embryo arrest strongly suggests pathogenic variants in *ZAR1*.
*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype overlaps with defects in other genes known to cause oocyte maturation defects, such as *PATL2*, *TUBB8*, *TRIP13*, and *CDC20*.
