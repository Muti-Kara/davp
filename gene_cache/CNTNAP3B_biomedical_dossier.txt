CNTNAP3B Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Dossier: CNTNAP3B**

**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID**: 32035.
*   **OMIM Gene ID**: No OMIM entry for this gene was found in the search results.
*   **Primary Disease Associations**: No definitive disease associations have been established. One database mentions a potential association with Nicolaides-Baraitser Syndrome, though this is not substantiated by other sources.
*   **Clinical Significance Level**: No evidence of clinical significance.
*   **Inheritance Patterns**: No inheritance patterns have been documented in patients.

**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **gnomAD v4.0 Constraint Scores**:
    *   pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant): 1.11e-05 (0.0000111).
    *   LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction): 0.81.
    *   pRec (probability of being recessive): 0.00.
    *   pNull (probability of being null): 1.00.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: The extremely low pLI score and high LOEUF score indicate that this gene is highly tolerant to loss-of-function variation. Genes with these scores are not expected to be a cause of monogenic disease.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Based on constraint scores, no variant classes are currently expected to be pathogenic. The gene is tolerant of both predicted loss-of-function and missense variation.

**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms**: No Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms are currently associated with this gene.
*   **Secondary HPO terms**: None reported.
*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: Not applicable.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Not applicable.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes**: No genotype-phenotype correlations have been established.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns**: No domain-specific patterns have been identified.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength**: Not applicable due to a lack of associated phenotypes.

**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   No well-characterized pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for *CNTNAP3B* were identified in ClinVar or the broader literature from the performed searches.

**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues**: Expression is documented in a wide range of tissues, including the brain, testis, kidney, liver, and various neuronal tissues like the trigeminal ganglion.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected**: The clinical relevance of the tissue expression pattern is unknown, as no disease phenotype has been linked to the gene.
*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes**: No specific information on developmental expression or age-related phenotypes was found.

**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function**: The protein product is predicted to be an integral membrane protein involved in cell adhesion.
*   **Disease Mechanism**: No disease mechanism has been established. Given the lack of constraint, haploinsufficiency is an unlikely mechanism.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**: The transcript may be subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, which could result in naturally low protein levels. By analogy to its paralog, *CNTNAP3*, it may play a role in neuron-glial cell interactions.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: No specific protein-protein interactions with known phenotypic relevance have been documented.

**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts**: The diagnostic yield is presumed to be zero, as no variants in this gene have been confirmed as pathogenic for any disorder.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene**: This gene is not routinely tested for in a clinical diagnostic setting.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: Not applicable.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Counseling should reflect that *CNTNAP3B* is not known to be associated with human disease. Variants in this gene are unlikely to be the cause of a patient's phenotype.

**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   No clinical or genetic studies establishing a phenotype for *CNTNAP3B* were found. Information is primarily derived from large-scale databases and studies of related genes.
    *   **UniProtKB Q96NU0** (2018): Provides protein information, noting that *CNTNAP3B* is a paralog of *CNTNAP3* resulting from a genomic duplication.
    *   **GeneCards: CNTNAP3B** (2024): Compiles gene-level data, including expression and a lack of HPO associations, and notes the transcript may undergo nonsense-mediated decay.
    *   **Peña-Garijo et al., Hum Genet, 2023**: This study on the related gene *CNTNAP2* defines its associated phenotype (severe cognitive impairment, epilepsy, behavioral abnormalities), which can be used for differential diagnosis.
    *   **Zenteno et al., Eur J Med Genet, 2020**: This study on *CNTN4* highlights a spectrum of neurobehavioral phenotypes and discusses reduced penetrance, which are relevant concepts for the contactin gene family.

**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations**: None exist.
*   **Phenotype Red Flags**: There are no HPO terms that strongly suggest pathogenic variants in *CNTNAP3B*.
*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**: Phenotypes involving neurodevelopmental delay, epilepsy, and/or autism spectrum disorder should prompt consideration of other related genes in the contactin family, such as:
    *   ***CNTNAP2***: Associated with global developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, language impairment, and autism spectrum disorder.
    *   ***CNTN4***: Associated with a spectrum of neurobehavioral phenotypes, including cognitive delay, motor delay, and seizures.
