AREL1 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **AREL1 Gene Dossier**

**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** AREL1 (HGNC: 20363)
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 615380
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** AREL1 has been identified as a candidate gene in a case of Central Precocious Puberty (CPP) with complex phenotypes, including imperforate anus and learning difficulties. It has also been associated with endometrial cancer and a type of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, though the primary connection to Mendelian disease is still emerging.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for a direct causal role in a specific Mendelian disorder is currently limited.
*   **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** A rare frameshift variant was identified in a sporadic case, suggesting a potential for dominant inheritance, though this segregated with CPP in familial cases in the same study.

**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** The gnomAD v4 pLI score is 0.00, suggesting tolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) variants. The LOEUF score is 0.74, which is above the recommended threshold of < 0.6 for identifying LoF-intolerant genes associated with Mendelian diseases.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that heterozygous protein-truncating variants in AREL1 are generally tolerated in the population. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While the gene appears tolerant to LoF variants overall, specific missense or frameshift variants, like the one reported in a patient with CPP, could be pathogenic, potentially through mechanisms other than simple haploinsufficiency.

**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:** Based on a single case report, the following HPO terms can be associated:
    *   Central precocious puberty (HP:0000826)
    *   Imperforate anus (HP:0000991)
    *   Learning disability (HP:0410042)
*   **Secondary HPO terms:** The same study also noted ventricular arrhythmia in a different patient with a variant in another gene, but this feature was part of the broader "complex phenotypes" described in the cohort.
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The reported case involved childhood-onset central precocious puberty.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The phenotype described was complex, involving multiple organ systems, but data is insufficient to define a full spectrum of severity.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** A rare frameshift variant (p.Ser229Aspfs\*3) was associated with central precocious puberty, imperforate anus, and learning difficulties.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No specific domain-phenotype correlations have been established in humans. The gene contains a HECT domain, critical for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Currently weak, as it is based on a single case report.
*   **Examples: Specific Variants → Specific Phenotypes:**
    *   The frameshift variant p.Ser229Aspfs\*3 was linked to a complex phenotype of central precocious puberty, imperforate anus, and learning difficulties.

**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   **Well-Characterized Pathogenic Variants:** No variants in AREL1 are currently listed in ClinVar as pathogenic or likely pathogenic with extensive supporting evidence.
*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** The strongest, albeit limited, evidence is for the rare frameshift variant (p.Ser229Aspfs\*3) identified in a patient with central precocious puberty and other anomalies.

**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to GTEx data, AREL1 shows broad expression, with the highest levels observed in tissues such as the testis, pituitary, and thyroid.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The expression in the pituitary gland could be relevant to its potential association with central precocious puberty. Broad expression in other tissues could potentially explain the complex, multi-system phenotype seen in the reported case.
*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Specific data on developmental expression is not detailed in the search results, but its potential role in puberty suggests importance during childhood and adolescent development.

**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** AREL1 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that inhibits apoptosis by ubiquitinating and targeting for degradation several pro-apoptotic proteins released from mitochondria.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** The exact disease mechanism is unknown. Given the gene's tolerance to LoF variants, a dominant-negative or gain-of-function effect from specific variants is a possibility, though not proven.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences:** The gene product is involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, specifically regulating apoptosis and TGF-beta signaling. Disruption could lead to abnormal cell survival or signaling, potentially impacting development, as suggested by the reported phenotype of central precocious puberty and congenital anomalies.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** AREL1 interacts with and ubiquitinates pro-apoptotic proteins like DIABLO/SMAC, HTRA2, and SEPT4/ARTS, preventing them from inhibiting IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins).

**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Extremely low. A single case with a rare frameshift variant was identified from a cohort of 38 patients with CPP and complex phenotypes.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for this gene is not routine and would likely only be considered on a research basis in individuals with unexplained syndromic presentations that might include features like central precocious puberty and other congenital anomalies.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no specific management guidelines based on an AREL1 variant. Management would be directed at the patient's specific phenotypes (e.g., hormone therapy for CPP).
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the limited evidence, counseling would involve significant uncertainty. It could be discussed that the gene is a candidate, but a causal link is not definitively established. The possibility of a dominant mode of inheritance could be mentioned based on the segregation pattern in one study.

**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   **PMID: 32958694 (Abstract reference in a conference proceeding), 2020:** Reported a rare frameshift variant (p.Ser229Aspfs\*3) in AREL1 in a girl with central precocious puberty, imperforate anus, and learning difficulties, identifying it as a candidate gene.
*   **PMID: 23479728, 2013:** Landmark study identifying AREL1 as a novel anti-apoptotic E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and degrades IAP antagonists like SMAC, HtrA2, and ARTS.

**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** There are currently no high-confidence associations.
*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** The combination of Central precocious puberty (HP:0000826) with other congenital anomalies, particularly anorectal malformations like Imperforate anus (HP:0000991), might warrant consideration of AREL1 as a candidate gene, although evidence is very limited.
*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** The phenotype of central precocious puberty can be associated with variants in other genes like *MKRN3*, *DLK1*, and *KISS1/KISS1R*. Syndromic presentations with CPP would require considering a broader range of genetic causes and syndromes.
