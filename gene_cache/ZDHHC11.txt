ZDHHC11 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### Gene Dossier: ZDHHC11

**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID, OMIM gene ID, primary disease associations**
    *   HGNC Symbol: ZDHHC11.
    *   Full Gene Name: ZDHHC palmitoyltransferase 11.
    *   Other Names: ZNF399.
    *   OMIM Gene ID: Not explicitly found in search results.
    *   Primary Associations: No definitive Mendelian disease is currently associated with ZDHHC11; however, it is implicated in oncogenesis and immune response.
*   **Clinical significance level**
    *   Evidence for a monogenic Mendelian disorder is not established.
    *   Associations have been reported with progression of bladder cancer (via gain of 5p15.33), Burkitt lymphoma, and susceptibility to pancreatic cancer through GWAS.
*   **Inheritance patterns observed in patients**
    *   No Mendelian inheritance patterns have been described in the provided search results.

**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**
    *   Specific numeric constraint scores for ZDHHC11 were not found in the provided search results.
*   **Clinical interpretation of constraint scores**
    *   The pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) score estimates the likelihood a gene is intolerant to heterozygous LoF variants; a score ≥ 0.9 suggests a gene is likely haploinsufficient.
    *   The LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper-bound fraction) score is a continuous metric of a gene's intolerance to LoF variation; lower scores indicate greater intolerance.
    *   pRec indicates the probability of being intolerant to homozygous, but not heterozygous, LoF variants.
*   **Variant classes most likely to be pathogenic**
    *   As no established Mendelian disease is linked to ZDHHC11, the variant classes most likely to be pathogenic are unknown.

**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms**
    *   No specific HPO terms are currently associated with germline variants in ZDHHC11 based on the provided search results.
*   **Secondary HPO terms**
    *   No secondary HPO terms are associated with ZDHHC11 in the provided search results.
*   **Age of onset patterns**
    *   Not applicable as no Mendelian disease has been defined.
*   **Phenotype severity spectrum**
    *   Not applicable as no Mendelian disease has been defined.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant classes and their typical phenotypes**
    *   Gain of the chromosomal region 5p15.33, which includes ZDHHC11, has been associated with disease progression in bladder cancer.
*   **Protein domain-specific phenotype patterns**
    *   The DHHC domain is required for palmitoyltransferase activity.
    *   A palmitoyltransferase activity-independent function, acting as an adapter protein, is critical for its role in the innate immune response.
*   **Genotype-phenotype correlation strength**
    *   Correlations for a Mendelian phenotype are not established.

**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   No well-characterized pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in ZDHHC11 associated with a specific Mendelian phenotype were identified in the provided search results.

**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest expressing tissues (GTEx TPM) and clinical correlation**
    *   Based on GTEx RNA-seq data, ZDHHC11 shows expression in a wide range of tissues, including the lung, uterus, spleen, liver, skin, and brain.
    *   Expression in tissues like the spleen is consistent with its documented role in the immune system.
*   **Tissue-specific phenotypes expected**
    *   Given its role in NF-κB and STING signaling, altered function could lead to tissue-specific inflammatory or autoimmune phenotypes.
    *   Aberrant expression in specific tissues may contribute to cancer development, such as Burkitt lymphoma and bladder cancer.
*   **Expression during development and age-related phenotypes**
    *   Information on expression during human fetal development is available but specific age-related phenotypes are not defined.

**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal gene function in one sentence**
    *   ZDHHC11 is an endoplasmic reticulum-localized enzyme that functions as a palmitoyltransferase and as an adapter protein in innate immune signaling pathways.
*   **Disease mechanism**
    *   In cancer, it is a target of the MYC-miR-150-MYB network, where it helps maintain high levels of the MYB oncogene, promoting proliferation in Burkitt lymphoma.
    *   In the immune system, the mechanism appears to be related to protein-protein interactions rather than enzymatic activity.
*   **Cellular/molecular pathways disrupted → phenotype consequences**
    *   Functions as a positive modulator of NF-κB signaling by interacting with TRAF6, enhancing its oligomerization and E3 ligase activity, which is crucial for inflammatory responses.
    *   Acts as an adapter to recruit IRF3 to STING1, promoting the activation of type I interferon responses against DNA viruses.
    *   Involved in palmitoylating neurochondrin (NCDN), which regulates NCDN's association with endosome membranes.

**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic yield in clinical cohorts**
    *   Not applicable, as ZDHHC11 is not currently associated with a defined Mendelian disorder for which clinical testing is performed.
*   **Most common reasons for testing this gene**
    *   Testing is currently relegated to a research setting, primarily for studies on cancer biology and immunology.
*   **Clinical actionability and management implications**
    *   There are no current clinical management guidelines related to ZDHHC11 variants.
*   **Genetic counseling considerations**
    *   Not applicable until a clear disease association is established.

**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**
    *   There are currently no known high-confidence associations between HPO terms and ZDHHC11 variants.
*   **Phenotype red flags**
    *   While not HPO terms, a patient presentation involving certain cancers (Burkitt lymphoma, bladder) or altered responses to viral infections could suggest a research-level interest in ZDHHC11 function.
*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**
    *   Not applicable without a defined, associated clinical syndrome.
