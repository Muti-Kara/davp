ARID4A Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
– **HGNC ID:** 9885.
– **OMIM gene ID:** 180201.
– **Primary disease associations:** While no definitive Mendelian disease is currently established, ARID4A is associated with Retinoblastoma and Plasma Cell Neoplasm. Mouse models suggest a role in hematologic malignancies like chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A variant has also been associated with schizophrenia in a Han Chinese population.
– **Clinical significance level:** The clinical significance is not yet definitively established for a specific Mendelian disorder.
– **Inheritance patterns observed in patients:** A heterozygous missense variant has been identified in siblings with schizophrenia. Somatic variants have been found in cases of multiple myeloma.

### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
– **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** All ARID family genes, except ARID3B/3C and JARID1B/1D, are generally intolerant to loss-of-function variants. Specific gnomAD pLI and LOEUF scores for ARID4A are not detailed in the provided results, but the family-wide intolerance suggests it is likely constrained. A low LOEUF score (recommended threshold < 0.35) indicates intolerance to loss-of-function variation.
– **Clinical interpretation of constraint scores:** Genes with high pLI scores (>0.9) and low LOEUF scores are under selective pressure, and protein-truncating variants in these genes are more likely to be pathogenic.
– **Variant classes most likely to be pathogenic:** Based on general principles, nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site variants are expected to be highly disruptive. Missense variants in critical functional domains can also be pathogenic.

### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
While a distinct syndrome is not defined, associated phenotypes can be inferred from model organisms and human studies. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) provides a standardized vocabulary for these features.
– **Primary HPO terms:**
  – Myeloid leukemia (HP:0004811).
  – Splenomegaly (HP:0001744).
  – Hepatomegaly (HP:0002240).
  – Anemia (HP:0001903).
  – Thrombocytopenia (HP:0001873).
  – Leukopenia (HP:0001882).
  – Monocytosis (HP:0012280).
  – Myelofibrosis (HP:0011974).
  – Multiple myeloma (HP:0006775).
  – Schizophrenia (HP:0100753).
– **Secondary HPO terms:**
  – Reduced fertility (in females) (HP:0000146).
  – Azoospermia/Oligozoospermia (in males, inferred from reduced mature spermatozoa).
  – Abnormal bone marrow cell morphology (HP:0002882).
– **Age of onset patterns:** Hematologic abnormalities in mouse models become progressively more severe with age, starting from 2 months and progressing to AML after 5 months.
– **Phenotype severity spectrum:** In mouse models, Arid4a deficiency alone leads to a chronic disorder, while combined haploinsufficiency with Arid4b results in a more severe phenotype with higher penetrance of AML.

### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
– **Variant classes and their typical phenotypes:** Null variants in mouse models are associated with hematologic defects, progressing from ineffective hematopoiesis to AML. A specific missense variant (p.His411Asp) has been linked to schizophrenia.
– **Protein domain-specific phenotype patterns:** The ARID domain is crucial for DNA binding, and a mutation in this domain (p.His411Asp) was shown to disrupt this function and affect cell cycle progression.
– **Genotype-phenotype correlation strength:** Currently weak, as most data comes from mouse models or limited human association studies.

### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
– **c.2614G>T (p.Glu872Ter) / rs1594966387:**
  – **ClinVar significance:** Likely pathogenic (somatic).
  – **Reported phenotypes:** Multiple myeloma (HP:0006775).
  – **AF:** Reported as a somatic variant.
– **c.1231C>G (p.His411Asp):**
  – **ClinVar significance:** Not listed in ClinVar, but reported as associated with disease.
  – **Reported phenotypes:** Schizophrenia (HP:0100753).
  – **AF:** Identified as a novel heterozygous variant in specific families.
– **Variants with strongest phenotype evidence:** The somatic nonsense variant p.Glu872Ter has a "Likely pathogenic" assertion in ClinVar for Multiple Myeloma, providing strong evidence for its role in that specific cancer.

### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
– **Highest expressing tissues (GTEx TPM) and clinical correlation:** The GTEx project provides data on gene expression across various tissues, which can help link genetic variability to specific clinical outcomes. ARID4A is ubiquitously expressed, with higher levels noted in the liver and blood. This aligns with the hematologic phenotypes observed in mouse models.
– **Tissue-specific phenotypes expected:** Given its role in hematopoiesis in mice, variants may primarily manifest with hematologic disorders. Its expression in reproductive tissues and interaction with the androgen receptor suggests a potential role in male infertility.
– **Expression during development and age-related phenotypes:** Mouse models show an age-dependent progression of hematologic disease, suggesting ARID4A is critical for maintaining hematopoietic homeostasis over time.

### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
– **Normal gene function:** ARID4A is a DNA-binding protein that modulates the activity of transcription factors, including RB1, and is a component of the mSin3A-HDAC repressor complex, influencing chromatin remodeling and gene expression.
– **Disease mechanism:** Haploinsufficiency is the likely mechanism for phenotypes associated with loss-of-function variants, as suggested by mouse models where Arid4a deficiency leads to disease. The schizophrenia-associated missense variant appears to interfere with DNA-binding activity, suggesting a loss-of-function or altered-function mechanism.
– **Cellular/molecular pathways disrupted → phenotype consequences:** Disruption of ARID4A function impairs transcriptional repression via the RB-E2F pathway and alters histone methylation patterns, leading to dysregulated gene expression. This affects hematopoietic differentiation, cell cycle control, and spermatogenesis.
– **Protein-protein interactions relevant to phenotype:** ARID4A's interaction with the retinoblastoma protein (RB1) is central to its function in cell cycle control and tumor suppression. It also interacts with its homolog ARID4B, and double mutations have a more severe effect in mice.

### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
– **Diagnostic yield in clinical cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for *ARID4A* variants is currently unknown for Mendelian disorders, as it is not yet associated with a specific, inherited syndrome. Its analysis may be relevant in the context of tumor profiling for cancers like AML or multiple myeloma.
– **Most common reasons for testing this gene:** Currently, testing would be performed in a research context or as part of large gene panels for hematologic malignancies or complex disorders like schizophrenia.
– **Clinical actionability and management implications:** At present, there are no specific management guidelines tied to *ARID4A* genotype. Findings are primarily of prognostic or research interest.
– **Genetic counseling considerations:** For a finding like the p.His411Asp variant associated with schizophrenia, counseling would involve discussing the uncertain role of this susceptibility gene and the complex, multifactorial nature of the disorder. For somatic variants, counseling is focused on the implications for the cancer itself.

### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
– **Wu, J. et al. (2008) *J Natl Cancer Inst*. PMID: 18728284:** Established in mouse models that Arid4a deficiency causes a multistep progression from myelodysplasia to acute myeloid leukemia, mirroring human disease courses.
– **Lai, C.H. et al. (2022) *Mol Psychiatry*. PMID: 35414002:** Identified a novel heterozygous missense variant (p.His411Asp) in *ARID4A* in families with schizophrenia, showing it impairs DNA binding and disrupts cell cycle regulation.
– **Wu, Y. et al. (2013) *Mol Endocrinol*. PMID: 23487765:** Demonstrated that ARID4A and ARID4B are crucial for male fertility and spermatogenesis in mice, acting as coactivators for the androgen receptor.
– **Lek, M. et al. (2016) *Nature*. PMID: 27535533:** Introduced the pLI score, a key metric for gene intolerance to loss-of-function variation, derived from the ExAC dataset.
– **Karczewski, K.J. et al. (2020) *Nature*. PMID: 32461654:** Published the gnomAD study, introducing the LOEUF constraint metric, which enhances the categorization of gene intolerance to truncating mutations.

### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
– **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Somatic nonsense mutations (e.g., p.Glu872Ter) are strongly associated with multiple myeloma (HP:0006775).
– **Phenotype red flags:** The presence of a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-like disorder (HP:0012280, HP:0004811) that transforms to acute myeloid leukemia should raise suspicion and could prompt investigation of *ARID4A*, particularly in a research or extensive panel setting.
– **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The hematologic phenotypes overlap with other genes causing myeloid malignancies, such as *RUNX1*, *CEBPA*, and *TET2*. The potential association with schizophrenia would overlap with a wide range of genes implicated in psychiatric disorders, such as *DISC1* and *CACNA1C*.
