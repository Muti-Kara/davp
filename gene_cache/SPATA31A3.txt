SPATA31A3 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Dossier: SPATA31A3**

**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** 32003.
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** No OMIM gene entry for SPATA31A3 was identified in the search results.
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** No definitive disease associations have been established; text mining has linked the gene to Chronic Closed-Angle Glaucoma and Deprivation Amblyopia.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for disease association is currently preliminary or absent; the gene is of uncertain significance.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No Mendelian inheritance patterns have been documented in patients.

**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** No specific constraint metric values for SPATA31A3 were found in the gnomAD database from the performed searches.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Without constraint scores, it is not possible to assess the gene's tolerance to loss-of-function or missense variation from population-level data.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** There is currently insufficient evidence to predict which variant classes are most likely to be pathogenic.

**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:** Currently, there are no HPO terms strongly and directly associated with variants in SPATA31A3 based on clinical case evidence. Inferred terms from text-mined disease associations include:
    *   *HP:0007842* - Closed angle glaucoma.
    *   *HP:0000572* - Amblyopia.
*   **Secondary HPO terms:**
    *   The gene's predicted function in spermatogenesis suggests a potential association with *HP:0000792* - Male infertility, although this is speculative.
    *   A GenomeRNAi screen identified *HP:0001623* - Decreased viability as a cellular phenotype.
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** No data available.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** No data available.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** No genotype-phenotype correlations have been established in the literature.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No domains with specific phenotype associations have been identified.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable due to lack of data.
*   **Examples:** No specific variant-phenotype examples are available.

**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   No well-characterized pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for SPATA31A3 were identified in ClinVar or published literature from the performed searches.

**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** RNA-sequencing data shows the highest expression in the testis.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High testis expression supports the predicted role in spermatogenesis, suggesting that pathogenic variants could potentially lead to male infertility.
*   **Expression During Development:** No data available on developmental expression patterns.

**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** The gene is predicted to play a role in spermatogenesis.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** The disease mechanism is unknown, as no monogenic disease has been definitively linked to this gene.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** The gene encodes a predicted integral membrane protein and belongs to the SPATA31 family; its disruption may affect cell differentiation or membrane-associated processes during sperm development.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** No specific protein-protein interactions with known clinical relevance have been reported.

**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield is unknown; the gene is not typically included in standard clinical diagnostic panels for specific disorders.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** This gene is not routinely tested in a clinical setting due to a lack of established disease association.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None have been defined.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Due to the lack of evidence, the clinical significance of any identified variants in SPATA31A3 would be uncertain.

**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   No publications establishing a direct genotype-phenotype correlation for SPATA31A3 in a clinical context were identified in the search results. The limited publications available focus on large-scale sequencing or characterization efforts.

**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** There are currently no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for SPATA31A3.
*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** Given the very limited data, there are no HPO terms that strongly suggest pathogenic variants in this gene. A combination of male infertility with the text-mined terms (closed-angle glaucoma, amblyopia) might be a weak indicator for further research but is not clinically established.
*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Not applicable due to the absence of a defined disease phenotype.
