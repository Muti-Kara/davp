GRM5 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** 4597.
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 604102.
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** GRM5 has been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Schizophrenia (SZ), and general central nervous system diseases. De novo GRM5 mutations and copy number variants have been identified in individuals with ASD.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for association with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders is emerging, with some studies classifying it as supportive. Associations with schizophrenia have been reported in specific populations.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Disease-associated variants appear to be primarily de novo or rare variants with a dominant mode of inheritance.

### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** According to gnomAD v2.1.1, the probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) for GRM5 is 0.00, the loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) is 1.09.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The pLI score near 0 suggests that the gene is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. The LOEUF score greater than 1.0 indicates that more LoF variants are observed than expected, reinforcing that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism. Genes with high pLI scores (≥ 0.9) are considered extremely intolerant of protein-truncating variants.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** While the gene is tolerant to LoF variation, specific missense variants or gain-of-function variants may be pathogenic, disrupting the receptor's signaling properties rather than causing a simple loss of function.

### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:**
    *   Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0000717).
    *   Impaired social interactions (HP:0000712).
    *   Stereotypy (HP:0000733).
    *   Anxiety (HP:0000739).
    *   Hyperactivity (HP:0000752).
    *   Intellectual disability (in some cases with specific variants).
    *   Seizures.
    *   Cognitive impairment (HP:0100543).
    *   Hallucinations (HP:0000738).
    *   Delusions (HP:0000736).
    *   Negative symptoms (in schizophrenia, e.g., blunted affect, avolition).
    *   Sensorimotor gating deficits.
    *   Memory impairment (HP:0002354).
*   **Secondary HPO terms:**
    *   Reduced hippocampal volume (HP:0002185).
    *   Abnormal motor activity.
    *   Repetitive behaviors.
    *   Speech disturbance.
    *   Depression (HP:0000716).
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Phenotypes are typically neurodevelopmental, with onset in childhood for conditions like ASD. Associations with psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia often manifest in adolescence or early adulthood.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The severity is variable, ranging from behavioral traits to more severe neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD.

### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** De novo mutations and rare variants are linked to ASD. Common variants (SNPs) have been associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia and specific cognitive phenotypes like lower IQ.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Specific information linking variant location within GRM5 protein domains to distinct phenotypes is limited in the provided search results.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation is currently moderate to supportive. While de novo variants are found in individuals with ASD, the precise contribution of GRM5 variants to the full clinical picture is still under investigation.
*   **Examples: specific variants → specific phenotypes:** Minor allele carriers of rs60954128 with schizophrenia showed reduced right hippocampal volume. Minor allele carriers of rs3824927 with schizophrenia had lower Intelligence Quotients (IQ). SNPs rs567990 and rs12421343 were significantly associated with schizophrenia in a Chinese-Han population.

### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   ClinVar lists numerous variants in GRM5, with classifications ranging from benign to variants of uncertain significance. Detailed pathogenic variant-phenotype associations with HPO terms are not consistently reported in the search results.
*   **rs60954128 (C>T):** Associated with reduced right hippocampal volume in male schizophrenia patients.
*   **rs3824927 (G>T):** Minor allele carriers with schizophrenia are associated with lower IQ.
*   **rs567990:** Allelic and genotypic frequencies showed significant differences between schizophrenia cases and controls.
*   **rs12421343:** Allelic and genotypic frequencies showed significant differences between schizophrenia cases and controls.
*   **rs504183:** Allelic frequency was associated with schizophrenia.

### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** GRM5 shows high expression in the brain, particularly in the caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and cortex. The Human Protein Atlas confirms high expression in various brain regions including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** High expression in brain regions critical for learning, memory, and executive function aligns with the observed neurodevelopmental and psychiatric phenotypes, such as cognitive deficits, social interaction impairments, and psychosis.
*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** GRM5 signaling is crucial for neurodevelopment. Altered expression or function during critical developmental periods could lead to neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD. Changes in expression have also been noted in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** GRM5 encodes the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), a G-protein coupled receptor that modulates synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability by activating a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function can be pathogenic. Excessive mGluR5 signaling is implicated in Fragile X syndrome, while reduced mGluR5 expression and function are linked to ASD. Genetic disruption in animal models leads to autism-like phenotypes, suggesting that reduced function can cause disease.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of GRM5 signaling impacts glutamatergic neurotransmission, long-term potentiation, and calcium signaling. This can lead to altered synaptic function and plasticity, resulting in deficits in learning, memory, and social behavior. The receptor is also part of a complex with cellular prion protein (PrPC) that mediates amyloid-β oligomer-induced synaptic disruption in Alzheimer's disease models.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** GRM5 interacts with Homer proteins, SHANK proteins, and ITPR1, which are critical for organizing postsynaptic signaling complexes. Disruption of these interactions can impair synaptic function and contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders.

### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for GRM5 variants in broad neurodevelopmental disorder cohorts is not well-established in the search results, though de novo variants are identified in ASD sequencing studies.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for GRM5 variants may be considered in individuals with unexplained autism spectrum disorder, particularly if there are associated features like intellectual disability or anxiety.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Currently, there are no specific treatments targeted at GRM5 variants. However, as the receptor is a major drug target, identifying a pathogenic variant could open future therapeutic avenues. Management is based on the patient's phenotype (e.g., behavioral therapy for ASD, antipsychotics for schizophrenia).
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the association with de novo mutations, recurrence risk in siblings is generally low but higher than the general population due to the possibility of germline mosaicism. For inherited variants, counseling would depend on the specific variant and family history.

### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** De novo missense mutations and CNVs in GRM5 are associated with a phenotype that includes Autism spectrum disorder (HP:0000717), Impaired social interactions (HP:0000712), and Stereotypy (HP:0000733). Certain common variants are associated with schizophrenia (HP:0100753) and related cognitive deficits.
*   **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of core ASD features (impaired social interaction, repetitive behaviors) with significant anxiety (HP:0000739) and hyperactivity (HP:0000752) should raise suspicion for variants in GRM5.
*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of GRM5-related disorders overlaps significantly with other genetic syndromes associated with ASD, such as Fragile X syndrome (FMR1), Phelan-McDermid syndrome (SHANK3), and Rett syndrome (MECP2). Interestingly, these syndromes also show alterations in mGluR5 signaling pathways.
