ZNG1E Gene Biomedical Dossier
As a clinical geneticist, I have conducted a comprehensive review of the available literature and database information for the human gene "ZNG1E" to create the following dossier.

It is important to note that upon initiation of this curation, it became apparent that "ZNG1E" (Zn Regulated GTPase Metalloprotein Activator 1E) is a protein-coding gene with limited direct association with human disease phenotypes in the current literature and clinical databases. Much of the available information is based on prediction and homology to other related genes.

### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC Symbol**: ZNG1E
*   **HGNC ID**: 24584
*   **OMIM Gene ID**: Not available. No disorders were found for ZNG1E Gene in OMIM.
*   **Primary Disease Associations**: Currently, there are no established disease associations for the ZNG1E gene in major clinical databases like OMIM or ClinVar.
*   **Clinical Significance Level**: The clinical significance is currently unknown or not established due to a lack of reported pathogenic variants and disease cohorts.
*   **Inheritance Patterns**: No inheritance patterns have been described, as no associated Mendelian disease has been identified.

### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull**: Specific constraint scores from gnomAD for ZNG1E are not readily available in the search results. Gene constraint metrics like pLI (probability of being loss-of-function intolerant) and LOEUF (loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction) are critical for assessing a gene's tolerance to inactivating mutations. Genes with high pLI scores (e.g., >0.9) are considered highly intolerant to loss-of-function variants, which often suggests a haploinsufficiency disease mechanism.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores**: Without specific scores for ZNG1E, clinical interpretation is speculative. A high pLI or low LOEUF score would suggest that loss-of-function variants are likely to be pathogenic, whereas scores indicating tolerance would lessen the suspicion for haploinsufficiency as a disease mechanism.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic**: Based on general principles, protein-truncating variants (nonsense, frameshift) in a constrained gene would be highly suspect. The pathogenicity of missense variants would depend on their location in functionally critical domains and supporting computational evidence.

### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms**: No primary HPO terms are associated with ZNG1E, as no human phenotype has been linked to variants in this gene.
*   **Secondary HPO terms**: No secondary HPO terms are associated with ZNG1E.
*   **Age of Onset Patterns**: Not applicable.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum**: Not applicable.

### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   No genotype-phenotype correlations have been established for ZNG1E due to the absence of reported disease-causing variants in the clinical literature. Establishing such correlations requires analyzing clinical and molecular data from multiple affected individuals.

### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   A search of major databases, including ClinVar, reveals no submitted pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants for the ZNG1E gene associated with a clinical phenotype. Therefore, a list of well-characterized variants cannot be provided at this time.

### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx)**: According to GeneCards, which references GTEx data, ZNG1E shows expression in a variety of tissues including the pancreas, small intestine, and stomach. The GTEx project provides a valuable resource for understanding tissue-specific gene expression, which can help predict which organs might be affected if a variant causes disease.
*   **Tissue-specific Phenotypes Expected**: Based on expression data, pathogenic variants in ZNG1E could potentially lead to phenotypes affecting the gastrointestinal system or pancreas. However, this is speculative without clinical data.
*   **Expression During Development**: Data from the NCBI Gene resource indicates expression during human fetal development, suggesting a potential role in embryogenesis. Therefore, a congenital or developmental phenotype could be a possibility.

### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function**: ZNG1E is predicted to be a zinc chaperone that enables GTPase activity and is involved in protein maturation by transferring zinc to target metalloproteins.
*   **Disease Mechanism**: The disease mechanism is unknown. If the gene is intolerant to variation, haploinsufficiency (loss-of-function) from a heterozygous protein-truncating variant would be a primary candidate mechanism. Dominant-negative or gain-of-function mechanisms are also possibilities, particularly for missense variants.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted**: Disruption of zinc homeostasis and metalloprotein activation could be the primary consequence of pathogenic variants. Given its predicted function, variants could impact numerous downstream cellular processes that rely on properly functioning metalloproteins.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype**: ZNG1A, a paralog of ZNG1E, activates methionine aminopeptidase METAP1. If ZNG1E has similar targets, variants might disrupt the function of these target proteins, leading to a clinical phenotype.

### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield**: The diagnostic yield for ZNG1E in clinical cohorts is effectively zero at present, as it is not typically included in disease-specific gene panels and no pathogenic variants have been reported.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing**: Currently, testing for ZNG1E would likely only occur in a research context or as part of whole-exome or whole-genome sequencing for a patient with an undiagnosed disorder where other candidate genes have been ruled out.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications**: None are established.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations**: Genetic counseling would be speculative. If a pathogenic loss-of-function variant were identified, counseling would address the unknown penetrance and variable expressivity, the potential for an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, and the lack of defined clinical outcomes.

### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   A comprehensive search of PubMed and other literature sources did not identify any clinical publications directly linking variants in ZNG1E to a human genetic disease. The existing publications are primarily focused on large-scale genomic studies, gene content mapping, or expression analyses.
    *   **Weiss A, et al. (2010)**: A study on the related gene *Zng1* (the murine ortholog of the ZNG1 family) demonstrated its role in modulating vertebrate zinc homeostasis, providing functional context for the gene family.
    *   **Fan Y, et al. (2002)**: This study on gene content and function identified ZNG1E (referred to as CBWD5) as part of a paralogous region, contributing to the understanding of its genomic context.

### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations**: None currently exist.
*   **Phenotype red flags**: None are known. For a novel candidate variant, one might consider phenotypes related to zinc metabolism or involving tissues with high expression (e.g., pancreas, gut), but this is purely speculative.
*   **Differential diagnosis considerations**: Given the predicted function related to zinc homeostasis, a potential phenotype could theoretically overlap with other genetic disorders of zinc metabolism, such as Acrodermatitis enteropathica (caused by variants in *SLC39A4*). However, this is a theoretical consideration and not based on clinical evidence for ZNG1E.
