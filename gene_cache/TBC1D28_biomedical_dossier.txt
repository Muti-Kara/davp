TBC1D28 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Dossier: TBC1D28**

**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** 29288.
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 618999.
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** No established disease phenotype has been linked to variants in TBC1D28 in OMIM or the current literature.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Unknown; evidence for a role in human disease is currently lacking or has not been reported.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No Mendelian inheritance pattern has been associated with TBC1D28.

**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **gnomAD v4.0.0 Constraint Metrics:**
    *   **pLI (probability of being Loss-of-Function Intolerant):** 0.01.
    *   **LOEUF (Loss-of-function Observed/Expected Upper-bound Fraction):** 1.25.
    *   **pRec (probability of being a recessive gene):** 0.61.
    *   **pNull (probability of being tolerant to both heterozygous and homozygous LoF variants):** 0.39.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The pLI score is close to 0 and the LOEUF score is greater than 0.6, indicating that TBC1D28 is not intolerant to loss-of-function variation. This gene is not considered highly constrained, suggesting it is not a common cause of severe, early-onset dominant disease.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Unknown due to the lack of established pathogenic variants; however, the gene's tolerance to LoF variants suggests that missense or gain-of-function variants would be a higher priority for investigation if a phenotype is suspected.

**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms are currently associated with TBC1D28 in the literature or major databases.
*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are associated with TBC1D28.
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable as no disease association has been established.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable as no disease association has been established.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Typical Phenotypes:** No genotype-phenotype correlations have been established for TBC1D28.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No specific phenotype patterns have been linked to variants in the TBC1 or Rab-GTPase activating protein domains of TBC1D28.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable.

**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   No variants in TBC1D28 have been classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic in ClinVar with a corresponding clinical phenotype.

**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx V8):** Testis (TPM 132.55), Lung (TPM 7.38), and Kidney - Cortex (TPM 4.31). Expression is also noted in the trabecular meshwork of the eye.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given the high expression in the testis, variants could theoretically be associated with male infertility; however, no such association has been reported.
*   **Expression During Development:** Information on developmental expression patterns and their relation to age-related phenotypes is not available.

**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** The TBC1D28 protein is predicted to function as a GTPase activator, specifically for Rab GTPases, playing a role in intracellular protein transport.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism of disease, if any, is unknown. The gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variants makes haploinsufficiency an unlikely mechanism.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences:** Disruption of Rab GTPase-mediated vesicle trafficking could theoretically impact numerous cellular processes, but specific downstream phenotypic consequences in humans have not been documented.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Interacts with Rab GTPases, but the clinical relevance of these interactions is unknown.

**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for TBC1D28 is effectively zero, as it is not currently associated with any clinical phenotype.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** This gene is typically sequenced as part of large gene panels or whole-exome/genome sequencing, not as a targeted test for a specific disorder.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at this time.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Variants identified in TBC1D28 should be classified as variants of uncertain significance in the absence of strong, segregating phenotypic evidence, given the lack of a known disease association and the gene's tolerance to variation.

**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   There are currently no key publications (2020-2025) or landmark historical papers that establish a definitive genotype-phenotype correlation for TBC1D28 in clinical genetics.

**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** None have been established.
*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are currently no HPO terms that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in TBC1D28.
*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Not applicable.
