HLA-DRB5 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:4953.
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 604776.
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** HLA-DRB5 is primarily associated with modifying susceptibility to and severity of various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases rather than causing a monogenic disorder. Associations include multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sarcoidosis, preeclampsia, rheumatoid arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease. It is also implicated in skin cutaneous melanoma prognosis and adverse drug reactions.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The evidence for HLA-DRB5's role as a genetic risk modifier is strong for several conditions, particularly multiple sclerosis. It is not typically classified as a definitive disease-causing gene for Mendelian disorders.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Inheritance is autosomal codominant, following Mendelian patterns for HLA haplotypes. Specific alleles are inherited as part of haplotypes with certain *HLA-DRB1* alleles.

### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD v4.0 does not provide constraint metrics for HLA genes due to their high polymorphism and complex nature, which makes the standard models for calculating pLI and LOEUF unreliable. Earlier versions of gnomAD also excluded this gene from constraint calculations.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The absence of constraint scores reflects the extreme allelic diversity and specialized function of HLA genes, not a tolerance to loss-of-function in a typical sense. Pathogenicity is determined by specific allele effects on immune recognition rather than gene inactivation.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Allelic variants (missense) that alter the structure of the peptide-binding groove are most likely to have functional consequences and be associated with disease risk. Null alleles, such as in *HLA-DRB5\*null*, are also functionally significant, influencing disease severity in conditions like MS.

### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:** As *HLA-DRB5* is primarily a risk modifier, it is not directly linked to a standard set of HPO terms describing a single disorder. Instead, it is associated with phenotypes of complex diseases such as:
    *   Multiple sclerosis (HP:0001336)
    *   Systemic lupus erythematosus (HP:0002725)
    *   Sarcoidosis (HP:0002106)
    *   Rheumatoid arthritis (HP:0000922)
    *   Preeclampsia (HP:0001659)
    *   Alzheimer's disease (HP:0002511)
    *   Type 1 diabetes mellitus (HP:0005978)
*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Phenotypes associated with specific disease contexts include:
    *   Pruritus (HP:0000989)
    *   Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (HP:0007358)
    *   Löfgren syndrome (a form of sarcoidosis)
    *   Presence of anti-nuclear antibodies (HP:0003493)
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** The age of onset corresponds to the associated complex disease, which can range from childhood (Type 1 diabetes) to adult and late-onset (MS, RA, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease).
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The presence or absence of certain *HLA-DRB5* alleles can modify disease severity. For example, the presence of *HLA-DRB5* may attenuate the severity of MS, while *HLA-DRB5\*null* is associated with a more progressive disease course.

### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:**
    *   **Allelic Variants:** Specific alleles, such as *HLA-DRB5\*01:01*, are part of the haplotype strongly associated with multiple sclerosis susceptibility. Other alleles are linked to risk for preeclampsia, SLE, and sarcoidosis.
    *   **Null Variants:** The *HLA-DRB5\*null* genotype, found in some African populations, is associated with an increased risk of developing secondary progressive MS when present with the *DRB1\*1503* allele.
    *   **Copy Number Variants (CNVs):** Deletions (copy number 0 or 1) of *HLA-DRB5* appear to be protective against systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in Chinese Han populations.
*   **Protein Domain-specific Phenotype Patterns:** Polymorphisms within the exons encoding the peptide-binding groove (exon 2 and 3) determine the repertoire of peptides presented to T-cells, thereby influencing immune responses and disease susceptibility.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** There is a **strong** correlation between the *HLA-DRB1\*15:01-HLA-DRB5\*01:01* haplotype and susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. The correlation between specific alleles and other conditions like SLE, sarcoidosis, and preeclampsia is moderate but statistically significant.
*   **Examples: specific variants → specific phenotypes:**
    *   **HLA-DRB5\*01:01:** Linked with *HLA-DRB1\*15:01*, it confers strong susceptibility to MS. It is also associated with pruritus in certain populations.
    *   **rs147440497 (F55Y):** A missense variant in exon 2 associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia in a Chinese population.
    *   ***HLA-DRB5\*null*:** In individuals with *HLA-DRB1\*1503*, this null allele is associated with a higher risk for a progressive MS course.

### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   ClinVar lists several alleles of *HLA-DRB5* with interpretations ranging from "risk factor" to "uncertain significance" for various conditions. Because pathogenicity is context-dependent (haplotype and disease), individual variant entries are less common than allele-level associations.
*   **HLA-DRB5\*01:01:01** / "risk factor" / Associated with Multiple Sclerosis, Sarcoidosis / Part of the common DR15 haplotype.
*   **HLA-DRB5\*null** / "risk factor" / Associated with increased severity of Multiple Sclerosis in specific haplotype contexts (*DRB1\*1503*) / Found in individuals of African ancestry.
*   **rs9268856 (AA genotype):** / "risk factor" / Increased risk of sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in a Chinese cohort.
*   **rs3130288:** / "risk factor" / Associated with Löfgren syndrome (a subtype of sarcoidosis) / Located in the MHC region near *HLA-DRB5*.
*   **CNV deletion:** / "protective factor" / Decreased risk for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.

### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** *HLA-DRB5* expression is largely restricted to professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Highest expression is observed in the spleen, with significant expression also in the lung and lymph nodes.
*   **Tissue-specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its expression in immune cells, phenotypes are primarily immunological. For example, altered antigen presentation in immune cells of the central nervous system contributes to MS pathology. Expression in placental immune cells like dendritic cells and macrophages is relevant to preeclampsia.
*   **Expression During Development:** Expression is tied to the development and function of the adaptive immune system. It plays a key role in presenting antigens throughout life.

### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** The HLA-DRB5 protein forms a heterodimer that presents processed extracellular peptides to CD4+ T-helper cells, initiating an adaptive immune response.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** The primary mechanism is altered immune response. Specific alleles change the peptide-binding properties, leading to inappropriate T-cell activation against self-antigens (autoimmunity) or altered responses to foreign antigens. It is not associated with classic haploinsufficiency or dominant-negative mechanisms in Mendelian terms.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences:**
    *   **Antigen Processing and Presentation (hsa04612):** Altered peptide binding affects which self- or foreign-peptides are presented, potentially triggering autoimmune responses in diseases like MS, RA, and SLE.
    *   **T-cell Receptor Signaling:** Inefficient or aberrant T-cell activation can lead to a failure of immune tolerance (autoimmunity) or altered inflammatory responses.
    *   **Molecular Mimicry:** A T-cell receptor may recognize both a foreign peptide (e.g., from a virus) presented by one HLA molecule and a self-peptide (e.g., myelin basic protein) presented by an HLA-DRB5 molecule, initiating an autoimmune attack.
*   **Protein-protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** The crucial interaction is between the HLA-DRα/β5 dimer, the bound peptide, and the T-cell receptor. This trimolecular interaction dictates the downstream immune response.

### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield:** *HLA-DRB5* typing is not used for diagnosing a monogenic disease. Its utility is in risk stratification and prognostic assessment for complex autoimmune diseases. For instance, in MS, the presence of the *DRB1\*15:01-DRB5\*01:01* haplotype is a major genetic risk factor.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing:** Testing is typically performed as part of HLA typing for transplantation (bone marrow, kidney), and in research contexts to study susceptibility to autoimmune diseases like MS, SLE, and sarcoidosis.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** Knowledge of a patient's *HLA-DRB5* status (e.g., *DRB5\*null*) might inform prognosis in MS, suggesting a higher risk for a progressive course, which could potentially influence long-term monitoring strategies.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling focuses on explaining the concept of genetic risk modification rather than deterministic disease causation. The presence of a risk allele increases susceptibility but does not guarantee disease, and its penetrance is influenced by other genetic and environmental factors.

### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   **Oksenberg JR, et al. (2008) J Immunol. PMID: 18849452:** Landmark study in an African American cohort that distinguished the roles of *HLA-DRB1* as the primary MS susceptibility gene and *HLA-DRB5* as a modifier of disease severity.

*   **Chen X, et al. (2014) Arthritis Rheumatol. PMID: 24339178:** Investigated copy number variations in *HLA-DRB5* in a Chinese Han population and found that CNV deletion was significantly protective against systemic lupus erythematosus.
*   **Cotsapas C, et al. (2015) Am J Respir Crit Care Med. PMID: 26176846:** A high-density genetic mapping study that identified and confirmed numerous variants in the MHC region, including near *HLA-DRB5*, associated with different phenotypes of sarcoidosis (Löfgren syndrome vs. non-Löfgren).
*   **Cao Y, et al. (2020) Front Immunol. PMID: 32574246:** Developed a capture RNA-seq method to analyze allele-level expression, showing differential RNA levels between haplotypes involving *HLA-DRB5*, which could explain functional differences in disease association.
*   **Guo H, et al. (2021) J Transl Med. PMID: 33874987:** Identified *HLA-DRB5* as an important biomarker associated with the prognosis and immune infiltration in skin cutaneous melanoma.
*   **Chen Y, et al. (2021) Front Aging Neurosci. PMID: 34858169:** Studied polymorphisms in inflammation-related genes, finding no significant association between the *HLA-DRB5* variant rs17425622 and risk for Parkinson's disease or Multiple System Atrophy in a Chinese population.
*   **Zhong Y, et al. (2023) Heliyon. PMID: 37063853:** A 2023 study identifying a specific *HLA-DRB5* missense variant (F55Y) as a risk factor for preeclampsia in a Chinese population, highlighting a potential functional impact on the protein structure.
*   **NCBI GeneRIFs:** Ongoing studies continue to link *HLA-DRB5* variants to a wide range of immune-mediated and neurological diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ALS, Alzheimer's disease, and type 1 diabetes.

### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:**
    *   **Multiple sclerosis (HP:0001336)** or **Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (HP:0007358)** strongly suggests investigating the *HLA-DRB1\*15-DRB5* haplotype, especially the *DRB5\*null* allele for prognostic context in certain populations.
    *   **Systemic lupus erythematosus (HP:0002725)** in a patient could be negatively correlated with a deletion CNV of *HLA-DRB5*.
    *   **Sarcoidosis (HP:0002106)**, particularly the acute form known as **Löfgren syndrome**, is strongly associated with variants in the MHC class II region including *HLA-DRB5*.
*   **Phenotype red flags:** While no single HPO term is pathognomonic, a clinical picture of **relapsing-remitting central nervous system demyelination** should prompt consideration of the *HLA-DRB1-DRB5* haplotype as a major risk factor. A family history of diverse autoimmune diseases (e.g., MS, RA, SLE) points to the general importance of the HLA region.
*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotypes associated with *HLA-DRB5* are broad and overlap with numerous other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. The key is that *HLA-DRB5* is a risk locus that interacts with other HLA genes (especially *HLA-DRB1*) and non-HLA genes. Phenotypic overlap is the rule, not the exception, and genetic analysis of the entire HLA region is often required to resolve associations.
