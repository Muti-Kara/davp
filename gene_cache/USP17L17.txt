USP17L17 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Dossier: USP17L17**

**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** 44445.
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** Not listed as associated with a clinical phenotype.
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** There are currently no established disease or phenotype associations for USP17L17 in OMIM, GeneCards, or ClinVar.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** No evidence of clinical significance has been reported.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No established inheritance patterns are documented due to the absence of confirmed pathogenic variants causing a Mendelian disease.

**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI:** 0.00 (gnomAD v2.1.1), indicating extreme tolerance to loss-of-function (LoF) variation.
*   **LOEUF:** 1.15 (gnomAD v4.0), a value that does not suggest intolerance to predicted loss-of-function variation.
*   **pRec:** 0.17 (gnomAD v2.1.1).
*   **pNull:** 0.83 (gnomAD v2.1.1).
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The very low pLI score and LOEUF score greater than 1.0 indicate that the gene is highly tolerant of inactivating variants in the general population. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a likely mechanism of disease for this gene.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Unknown. Given the tolerance to LoF variants, pathogenic variants, if they exist, might act via a gain-of-function or dominant-negative mechanism, though there is no current evidence for this.

**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:** No HPO terms are associated with pathogenic variants in USP17L17 in major clinical or literature databases.
*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms have been documented.
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable, as no associated disease has been described.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** No genotype-phenotype correlations have been established.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Not applicable.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable.
*   **Examples:** No specific variants have been correlated with specific phenotypes.

**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   No variants classified as "Pathogenic" or "Likely Pathogenic" for a Mendelian disorder are reported in ClinVar for USP17L17. Numerous variants of uncertain significance and likely benign variants are listed.

**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** RNA-sequencing data shows the highest expression in the testis, followed by the placenta and retina. Moderate expression is seen in the esophagus and gallbladder.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Due to the lack of a known disease association, any expected tissue-specific phenotypes are purely speculative based on expression patterns (e.g., related to male fertility or placental function).
*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Data on developmental expression patterns are not available.

**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** The gene encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes ubiquitin from specific proteins, which is predicted to regulate processes like cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell migration.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** No disease mechanism has been identified. The high tolerance to LoF variants makes haploinsufficiency an unlikely cause of disease.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences:** The gene is involved in protein deubiquitination pathways. However, the specific phenotypic consequences of disrupting these pathways via USP17L17 variation are unknown.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** While USP17 family members interact with various proteins, no specific interactions have been directly linked to a clinical phenotype for USP17L17.

**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield is effectively zero, as this gene is not associated with a known disease phenotype.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** This gene is not typically tested for as a primary diagnostic target. Variants may be identified incidentally on large sequencing panels or exome/genome sequencing.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are no clinical actionability or management guidelines associated with variants in this gene.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counselors should note the lack of evidence for any disease association. Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) should be interpreted with caution, and their pathogenicity should not be assumed given the gene's high tolerance to variation.

**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   No clinical studies or case reports establishing a genotype-phenotype correlation for USP17L17 were identified. Searches for publications yielded papers on the broader USP17 gene family, gene function, or bioinformatics methodologies rather than clinical genetics findings for this specific gene.

**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** There are currently no known high-confidence HPO-variant associations for USP17L17.
*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** There are no "red flag" HPO terms that would strongly suggest testing or analyzing this gene.
*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Not applicable, as there is no defined phenotype.
