GOLGA8A Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Dossier: GOLGA8A**

**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** 31972.
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 616180.
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Currently, there are no established, definitive disease associations for GOLGA8A. One source mentions a possible association with Smith-Mccort Dysplasia, however this is not corroborated by other major databases.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** No evidence to support clinical significance at this time.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No clear inheritance patterns have been established due to the lack of a defined disease phenotype.

**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** GOLGA8A has a low probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) score, suggesting it is not highly constrained against protein-truncating variants. Specific values from gnomAD are not readily available in the search results. The loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) score is a continuous metric of a gene's intolerance to loss-of-function variation.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** Low pLI scores suggest that heterozygous loss-of-function variants in GOLGA8A are likely to be tolerated and may not be sufficient to cause disease.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** There is currently no evidence to suggest that any specific class of variant in GOLGA8A is pathogenic.

**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:** No primary HPO terms are directly associated with GOLGA8A.
*   **Secondary HPO terms:** No secondary HPO terms are directly associated with GOLGA8A.
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Not applicable as no disease is currently associated with this gene.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** Not applicable.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** No established genotype-phenotype correlations currently exist for GOLGA8A.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** No protein domain-specific phenotype patterns have been described.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Not applicable.
*   **Examples:** There are no specific variant-phenotype examples at this time.

**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   **Well-Characterized Pathogenic Variants:** A search of ClinVar and other resources did not identify any well-characterized pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in GOLGA8A associated with a clinical phenotype.
*   **Variants with Strongest Phenotype Evidence:** None at present.
*   **Novel Variants from Recent Case Reports:** No recent case reports with novel GOLGA8A variants and associated phenotypes were identified in the search results.

**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** GOLGA8A shows expression in various tissues, with notable levels in the testis, cerebellum, and adrenal gland according to the Human Protein Atlas which incorporates GTEx data.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given the expression pattern, one might speculate on roles in neurological or endocrine function, but this is not supported by any current clinical data.
*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Information on developmental expression is not detailed in the search results.

**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** GOLGA8A is a member of the golgin family of proteins, which are localized to the Golgi apparatus and are thought to be involved in maintaining the structure of the Golgi complex and in vesicular trafficking.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** As no disease is currently linked to GOLGA8A, the disease mechanism is unknown. One study noted that palindromic GOLGA8 core duplicons may contribute to the instability of chromosome 15q13.3, a region associated with neurodevelopmental disorders.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted:** It is predicted to be involved in Golgi organization. One study suggested GOLGA8A may play a role in the productive uptake of antisense oligonucleotides. Another study found a correlation between GOLGA8A expression and Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** GOLGA8A interacts with numerous other proteins, but the clinical relevance of these interactions is not yet understood.

**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for GOLGA8A is currently zero, as it is not tested for in relation to any specific phenotype.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** This gene is not routinely tested for clinical diagnostic purposes.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** There are no clinical actionability or management guidelines associated with variants in GOLGA8A.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Given the lack of evidence for a disease association, variants in GOLGA8A should be interpreted with caution. The gene's location in a region with segmental duplications may also complicate variant analysis.

**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   **Antonell, A., et al. (2010). *Palindromic GOLGA8 core duplicons promote chromosome 15q13.3 microdeletion and evolutionary instability*. Nature Genetics. PMID: 20436483.** This study provides evidence that the GOLGA8 gene family, through its core duplicons, is involved in the genomic instability of the 15q13.3 region, which is associated with several neurodevelopmental phenotypes.
*   **Li, J., et al. (2022). *GOLGA8 increases bulk antisense oligonucleotide uptake and activity in mammalian cells*. Nucleic Acids Research. PMID: 35652934.** This research suggests a novel function for GOLGA8 in the cellular uptake of antisense oligonucleotides, which could have therapeutic implications.
*   **Wang, J., et al. (2023). *Identification of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and their immune function characterization*. Frontiers in Immunology. PMID: 37448698.** This study identified GOLGA8A as a potential biomarker in Alzheimer's disease through bioinformatic analysis, though its role requires further investigation.

**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-Confidence HPO-Variant Associations:** There are currently no high-confidence HPO-variant associations for GOLGA8A.
*   **Phenotype Red Flags:** At present, no specific HPO terms are considered "red flags" that would strongly suggest a pathogenic variant in GOLGA8A.
*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Due to the lack of a defined phenotype, differential diagnosis considerations are not applicable. The broader 15q13.3 deletion syndrome, which has a known complex neurodevelopmental phenotype, should be considered when there are copy number variations in this region.
