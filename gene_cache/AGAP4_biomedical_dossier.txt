AGAP4 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Dossier: AGAP4**

**Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** 23459.
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** No OMIM gene entry was found.
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** Currently, no monogenic diseases are definitively associated with AGAP4. However, altered expression has been linked to benign tumors and may be a biomarker for cellular responses to radiation exposure. Additionally, structural variants involving AGAP4 have been noted in gliomas.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** The clinical significance of variants in AGAP4 is largely unknown, with most variants in ClinVar classified as being of uncertain significance.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** No clear inheritance pattern has been established due to the lack of a defined associated Mendelian disease.

**Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** gnomAD constraint metrics (pLI, LOEUF, etc.) for AGAP4 are not explicitly detailed in the search results. Such metrics are used to assess a gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variants. A low LOEUF score (e.g., < 0.35) or a high pLI score (e.g., > 0.9) would suggest intolerance to inactivation.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The absence of reported constraint scores for AGAP4 in the provided results prevents a direct interpretation of its tolerance to variation. Generally, genes intolerant to loss-of-function variants are more likely to be associated with dominant diseases.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Without established disease associations, it is difficult to determine which variant classes are most likely to be pathogenic for AGAP4.

**Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are yet linked to variants in AGAP4 in the provided search results.
*   **Secondary HPO terms:** The search did not yield any secondary HPO terms associated with AGAP4.
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Information regarding the age of onset for any potential AGAP4-related phenotype is not available.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The spectrum of severity for phenotypes associated with AGAP4 variants has not been characterized.

**Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Due to the lack of defined disease associations, no correlation between variant classes and specific phenotypes can be described.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Information on phenotype patterns related to specific protein domains of AGAP4 is not available.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The strength of genotype-phenotype correlations for AGAP4 is currently not established.
*   **Examples: Specific Variants → Specific Phenotypes:** No examples of specific AGAP4 variants leading to distinct phenotypes were found in the search results.

**Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   The search results did not identify any well-characterized pathogenic variants in AGAP4 with established phenotype associations. ClinVar lists some variants, but their clinical significance is predominantly uncertain.

**Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** AGAP4 shows expression in various tissues, with notable levels in the liver, nervous system, intestine, and kidney. The GTEx project provides detailed RNA sequencing data across numerous tissues, which can help in understanding the potential clinical consequences of variants in this gene.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Given its expression profile, variants in AGAP4 could potentially manifest in phenotypes related to the liver, nervous system, or kidneys. However, no such tissue-specific phenotypes have been documented.
*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** Information on the developmental expression of AGAP4 and any associated age-related phenotypes was not found.

**Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** AGAP4 is a putative GTPase-activating protein.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanisms by which variants in AGAP4 might cause disease (e.g., haploinsufficiency, dominant-negative effects) have not been determined.
*   **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences:** The specific cellular or molecular pathways that are disrupted by AGAP4 variants and lead to phenotypic consequences are not yet understood. The protein is part of the centaurin gamma-like family.
*   **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** Paralog AGAP5 is noted as an important related gene. AGAP family members may have roles in processes like endocytic recycling.

**Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** The diagnostic yield for AGAP4 testing in clinical cohorts is unknown, as it is not currently associated with a specific disease.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing for AGAP4 would likely be performed in a research context or as part of a broad gene panel for individuals with undiagnosed conditions.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** At present, there are no known clinical actions or management guidelines directly related to AGAP4 variants.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For genetic counseling, it would be important to convey the uncertainty regarding the clinical significance of most AGAP4 variants.

**Key Clinical Literature & Studies**
*   The search results did not provide specific publications detailing clinical cases with confirmed pathogenic AGAP4 variants and associated phenotypes. One study mentioned that altered AGAP4 expression might be a biomarker for cellular responses to low-dose radiation and is associated with benign tumors. Another study noted the involvement of structural variants of AGAP4 in gliomas.

**HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no high-confidence associations between specific HPO terms and variants in AGAP4.
*   **Phenotype red flags:** No specific "red flag" phenotypes have been established that would strongly suggest the presence of a pathogenic variant in AGAP4.
*   **Differential Diagnosis Considerations:** Given the lack of a defined phenotype, differential diagnosis considerations are not applicable at this time.
