IL7 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
– **HGNC ID:** 6023
– **OMIM Gene ID:** 146660
– **Primary Disease Associations:** Immunodeficiency 130 with HPV-related verrucosis (IMD130), Inherited epidermodysplasia verruciformis.
– **Clinical Significance Level:** While OMIM lists a connection to an immunodeficiency, the primary role of IL7 appears more as a key cytokine in lymphocyte development and homeostasis rather than a direct cause of a well-defined monogenic disorder through pathogenic variants within the gene itself. Much of the literature points to the significance of its receptor, IL7R.
– **Inheritance Patterns Observed in Patients:** Autosomal recessive for IMD130.

### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
– **pLI, LOEUF, pNull:** The gnomAD v2.1.1 constraint metrics for *IL7* show a pLI of 0.00, a pNull of 0.99, and a loss-of-function observed/expected upper bound fraction (LOEUF) of 0.81.
– **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The very low pLI and high LOEUF scores indicate that *IL7* is tolerant to loss-of-function (LoF) variation. This suggests that haploinsufficiency is not a common disease mechanism for this gene. Genes with low LOEUF scores show strong selection against predicted LoF variation, whereas higher scores suggest greater tolerance.
– **Variant Classes Most Likely to Be Pathogenic:** Based on the tolerance to LoF variants, pathogenic variants, when they occur, would more likely be missense or other variants that do not result in a complete loss of function, though this is speculative given the rarity of associated disease.

### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
– **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Homozygous loss-of-function variants, such as nonsense and frameshift mutations, are associated with Immunodeficiency 130 with HPV-related verrucosis.
– **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Data is limited for IL7 itself, but for its receptor, IL7R, mutations in different domains lead to varying phenotypes, from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) to autoimmunity.
– **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** The correlation between homozygous loss-of-function *IL7* variants and IMD130 appears strong based on limited case reports.

### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
– **rs1486611027 / p.Arg69Ter (c.205C>T):** Pathogenic for Immunodeficiency 130 with HPV-related verrucosis (HPO: HP:0100521, HP:0002829). AF: Not reported in gnomAD.
– **c.284del:** Pathogenic for Immunodeficiency 130 with HPV-related verrucosis. AF: Not reported in gnomAD.
– **MET1?:** Pathogenic for Immunodeficiency 130 with HPV-related verrucosis. AF: Not reported in gnomAD.
– **rs2587156:** This SNP showed a near-significant association with multiple sclerosis in one study.
– **rs1054283:** This SNP showed a significant association with multiple sclerosis.

### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
– **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM):** According to the Human Protein Atlas, *IL7* shows the highest expression in the lymph node and small intestine. RNA-seq data from GTEx also shows expression in the spleen, tonsil, and appendix.
– **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** The expression profile in lymphoid tissues is consistent with its critical role in T and B cell development and homeostasis. Dysfunction would be expected to primarily manifest as immunodeficiency. Expression in the intestine by epithelial cells suggests a role in mucosal immunity.
– **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** *IL7* is crucial for early T-cell development in the thymus. Its role in B-cell development in humans appears to be more important in adulthood than in the neonatal period.

### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
– **Normal Gene Function:** IL7 is a hematopoietic growth factor essential for the development, proliferation, and survival of lymphoid progenitors, particularly T and B cells.
– **Disease Mechanism:** For IMD130, the mechanism is loss-of-function due to biallelic pathogenic variants, leading to a deficiency of the IL-7 cytokine. This impairs T-cell development and homeostasis.
– **Cellular/Molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences:** IL-7 signals through a receptor complex that activates the JAK-STAT and PI3K-Akt pathways. Disruption of this signaling cascade due to IL-7 deficiency leads to failed T-cell development (especially CD4+ T cells), resulting in severe T-cell lymphopenia and susceptibility to infections, particularly HPV. The cytokine also plays a role in regulating the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2.
– **Protein-Protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** IL-7 interacts with its receptor, which consists of the IL-7Rα (IL7RA) and the common gamma chain (γc or IL2RG). This interaction is crucial for initiating the downstream signaling cascade required for lymphocyte development and survival.

### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
– **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** Testing for *IL7* variants is likely low yield and would be considered in patients with a specific phenotype of T-cell lymphopenia and severe, recalcitrant HPV infections after more common causes of immunodeficiency have been excluded.
– **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** The primary reason for testing would be a clinical presentation consistent with IMD130, including T-cell lymphopenia and extensive verrucosis.
– **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** For patients with confirmed IMD130, management would focus on aggressive treatment of infections and surveillance for skin malignancies. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could be a consideration, though its efficacy for this specific disorder is not well-documented in the search results.
– **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** For families with a confirmed pathogenic variant, autosomal recessive inheritance should be discussed. This implies a 25% recurrence risk for future offspring of carrier parents. Carrier testing for at-risk family members could be considered.

### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
– **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Homozygous loss-of-function variants (e.g., p.Arg69Ter) are strongly associated with T-cell lymphopenia (HP:0002829) and susceptibility to human papillomavirus infection leading to verrucae (HP:0100521).
– **Phenotype red flags:** The combination of severe, disseminated verrucosis and significant T-cell lymphopenia (particularly low CD4+ counts) should raise strong suspicion for a defect in the IL-7 pathway, including potential *IL7* deficiency.
– **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The phenotype of T-cell lymphopenia overlaps with numerous other primary immunodeficiencies, including those caused by mutations in *IL7R*, *IL2RG*, *JAK3*, *RAG1/2*, and others. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis can also be caused by mutations in *EVER1* (*TMC6*) and *EVER2* (*TMC8*).
