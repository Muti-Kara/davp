LRRC37A2 Gene Biomedical Dossier
### **Gene Identity & Clinical Context**
*   **HGNC ID:** HGNC:32404
*   **OMIM Gene ID:** 616556
*   **Primary Disease Associations:** While no definitive monogenic disease is established, *LRRC37A2* expression is significantly associated with Parkinson's disease. It has also been associated with breast cancer and is implicated in gastric cancer. One database notes associations with Epilepsy, Progressive Myoclonic, 6 and Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy 96, though primary evidence is not detailed.
*   **Clinical Significance Level:** Evidence for a causal role in monogenic disease is currently limited or not established; its role appears to be as a risk modifier or a gene involved in complex, multifactorial diseases.
*   **Inheritance Patterns:** Not applicable for monogenic disease; its effects on complex disease risk are studied through population-level associations (GWAS).

### **Constraint & Variant Intolerance**
*   **pLI, LOEUF, pRec, pNull:** A search for *LRRC37A2* in the gnomAD v4.0.0 database did not return any results for constraint metrics (pLI, LOEUF). This is common for genes in complex genomic regions that are difficult to analyze with high confidence.
*   **Clinical Interpretation of Constraint Scores:** The absence of constraint data suggests that it is difficult to assess the gene's tolerance to loss-of-function variation using current large-scale population data. This may be due to high sequence homology and copy number variability in its genomic region.
*   **Variant Classes Most Likely to be Pathogenic:** Given the association with complex diseases, pathogenic variants may be those that alter expression levels (e.g., eQTLs) rather than traditional protein-truncating or missense variants causing a Mendelian disorder. Non-synonymous variants that co-segregate with Parkinson's disease risk alleles have been noted.

### **Phenotype Spectrum & HPO Terms**
*   **Primary HPO terms:** No specific HPO terms are definitively linked to pathogenic variants within *LRRC37A2* itself. The Human Phenotype Ontology database does not list direct annotations for this gene.
*   **Secondary HPO terms:** Not applicable, as no primary terms are established.
*   **Age of Onset Patterns:** Associations are with adult-onset diseases like Parkinson's disease and various cancers.
*   **Phenotype Severity Spectrum:** The gene's contribution is to complex disease risk, where severity is variable and influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors.

### **Genotype-Phenotype Correlations**
*   **Variant Classes and Their Typical Phenotypes:** Specific variants (eQTLs) that alter *LRRC37A2* expression are associated with risk for Parkinson's disease. Increased expression and copy number of *LRRC37A/2* are associated with protective haplotypes for Parkinson's disease.
*   **Protein Domain-Specific Phenotype Patterns:** Information on specific domain-related phenotypes is not available. The protein contains Leucine-rich repeat domains.
*   **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation Strength:** Moderate. The correlation is at the level of risk association for complex diseases, not direct causation of a monogenic disorder. A transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) identified *LRRC37A2* as the most significant gene associated with Parkinson's disease across 13 brain tissues.
*   **Examples: specific variants → specific phenotypes:** Risk variants in the *MAPT* region on chromosome 17q21.31 influence *LRRC37A2* expression, which in turn is associated with susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. For instance, the MAPT H1 haplotype is linked to its expression levels.

### **Clinical Variants & Phenotype Associations**
*   A search of ClinVar did not yield any variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic specifically for *LRRC37A2*. The database contains many variants of uncertain significance or those without clinical significance asserted.

### **Tissue Expression & Clinical Relevance**
*   **Highest Expressing Tissues (GTEx TPM) and Clinical Correlation:** The gene is highly expressed in the testis and also shows expression in the brain. Its expression in various brain tissues is significantly associated with Parkinson's disease. Reduced mRNA levels are observed in gastric cancer tissue.
*   **Tissue-Specific Phenotypes Expected:** Brain-related expression correlates with risk for neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. Expression in immune cells may be relevant to viral infections.
*   **Expression During Development and Age-Related Phenotypes:** The Human Protein Atlas notes expression in early spermatids. Its primary associations are with adult-onset diseases.

### **Molecular Mechanism & Phenotype Pathways**
*   **Normal Gene Function:** *LRRC37A2* is a membrane-associated protein that plays a role in cellular migration, chemotaxis, and the astroglial inflammatory response.
*   **Disease Mechanism:** The mechanism is not fully elucidated but appears related to altered gene expression levels influencing complex disease risk. In Parkinson's disease, it interacts with α-synuclein in astrocytes, and its expression level may impact astroglial dysfunction. In gastric cancer, downregulation via DNA methylation is a proposed mechanism.
*   **Cellular/molecular Pathways Disrupted → Phenotype Consequences:** In Parkinson's disease, altered *LRRC37A2* levels may impair the ability of astrocytes to respond to inflammation and support neurons, contributing to neurodegeneration.
*   **Protein-protein Interactions Relevant to Phenotype:** *LRRC37A2* directly interacts with soluble α-synuclein and co-localizes with Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease patients.

### **Diagnostic Yield & Clinical Utility**
*   **Diagnostic Yield in Clinical Cohorts:** This gene is not typically tested for diagnostic purposes in Mendelian disease.
*   **Most Common Reasons for Testing This Gene:** Testing is currently for research purposes, primarily in genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association studies for complex diseases like Parkinson's disease and cancer.
*   **Clinical Actionability and Management Implications:** None at present.
*   **Genetic Counseling Considerations:** Counseling would focus on the gene's role as a minor contributor to complex disease risk, emphasizing that it is not a standalone cause for a monogenic disorder.

### **Key Clinical Literature & Studies**

### **HPO-Variant Matching Summary**
*   **High-confidence HPO-variant associations:** Currently, there are no established high-confidence associations between specific variants in *LRRC37A2* and specific HPO terms for a monogenic disease.
*   **Phenotype red flags:** There are no HPO terms that strongly suggest a primary pathogenic variant in this gene. Its relevance is currently tied to risk for complex, multifactorial diseases like Parkinson's disease and certain cancers.
*   **Differential diagnosis considerations:** The gene is located in the 17q21.31 chromosomal region, which is associated with Koolen-de Vries syndrome when deleted. Phenotypes associated with the broader microdeletion (e.g., developmental delay, hypotonia, characteristic facial features) are caused by haploinsufficiency of other genes in the region, primarily *KANSL1*, not *LRRC37A2*.
